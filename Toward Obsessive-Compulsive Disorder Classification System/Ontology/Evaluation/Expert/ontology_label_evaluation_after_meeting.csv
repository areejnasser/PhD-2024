"I am not cured of OCD. I'm still in the process. I've made a TON of progress in therapy. I wanted to make a thread about my progress so people would feel better, but for some reason I was not motivated, because I was better, and I didn't know how to convince people that therapy actually DOES work. I think that's why you often don't see posts here from people who get better, and you don't usually hear about people getting better often on this forum but they do.

Today, I had a sadness moment, and that's why I posted here. And even thought this might not bring home the point, or be perfect, I decided to write about both.

I'm sad because I saw the movie """"The Fault in Our Stars"""" and the girl in that movie had cancer, but I was actually jealous of her. And it makes me sad to think my OCD makes my life so hard that I can be jealous of someone who has cancer. Like when I saw she didn't have oily hair, it meant she could shower more than once a week like I do because my showers are too OCDish (they've improved a lot - in the past I wanted to kill myself when I took showers). I saw like the guy just taking off her clothes in the sorta sex scene, and idk if TMI lol but I'm like too careful about clothes because feel like I don't want to """"cross contaminate"""" my body and have clean parts like Howie Mandel with the palms of his hands, so that wasn't me with my last boyfriend. I'd often not do anything bc of OCD with clothes. When I saw her get in the car and start driving I thought, I wish I didn't have to check things in my car. She is probably gonna drive home and just click the lock and go home. When she said she didn't want to read a letter someone said, I felt sad because I have an OCD thing with reading things, like feeling like I have to read things.... *sigh* idk. I think OCD is really really underrepresented in our society. I guess maybe one of the reasons I am sad after this movie is because I like fell in love with her love interest, and because of what happened in the movie, maybe I just feel like that. But anyway, I just want to like hang out with you guys, like sit in a circle and just be there with you guys, because you understand. But I did get a good quote from the movie, """"You don't get to choose if you get hurt in this world. But you do have a say in who hurts you."""" Meaning one of the people wanted to be away from the other bc if she died she would hurt him, and she had like a similar thing happen to her. So one of them got to hurt the other, but they had an amazing love. (And by amazing like, I don't mean movie star, like that movies was about*, one of the things it was about, is that even if you're not known by many people, you are loved by maybe a few people in your life and like you ARE important and remembered.) So when I heard this I was like """"oh true, I didn't choose to get hurt but I got hurt. some evil force hurt me. and I never chose it."""" and it made me feel better. And like I know even with OCD in my life, I've had some great situations like requited romance and like some people have been significant. So... basically... idk I guess I just need a little support right now. :\

But, usually I don't feel like this. I actually got WAY better with OCD. My showers used to take me 4 hours and I'd be a zombie after bc of the concentrated OCD experiences I had, sometimes I'd sit in my room with a knife and scratch my wrists, and I'd often think of suicide. I went to a psychologist (like a decent OCD psychologist, not some phony, which there are a lot of), I started taking medication and I saw a HUGE improvement. My showers are like an hour and 20 minutes now and we're working on them now (we were working on other things for a while, that's why they stayed like that). I used to like play candy crush on my computer while knowing I wasn't doing anything with my life after college because OCD just debilitated me in a lot of ways and my parents weren't supportive to top it all off. I couldn't clean my desk in front of me, with a bunch of random stuff and some junk around the computer because putting one object away would cause me to OCD over the drawer I put it in and line some **** up. Like I had OCD for a while, I didn't have to let it get that bad, and I so wish I didn't. I still am able to see improvement, it would just have been easier earlier, I mean, and not having had to like work down from a really bad level. I still have to get to how my OCD was like 6 years ago. Though maybe I just had different symptoms and I don't remember my struggles. That was probably it. But anyway, now I can clean things pretty easily. I can throw things away, I can wash my hair if I don't shower, I can go out with friends which was a huge OCD pain before bc I'd have OCD tied to going out. I used to be depressed. With the exception of today, I've been happy* recently. Like, actually happy which I didn't feel before because of OCD. But I've been fairly happy. I got way better. It IS possible, and more so easy and likely, to get better if you have OCD. You just have to find a psychologist who can treat it. If you really want to, but are afraid or doubtful, just GO. Just find one. Don't think about it, just find one and go to her or him. My psychologists I visited never once judged me. If you have OCD you deserve help. Even medication can make you feel better alone. Though therapy gets rid of your OCD symptoms more. But still medication is nice. Something they don't tell you about OCD treatment, which you guys probably know by now - how it involves you doing the opposite of what OCD tells you, like in a controlled way and slowly if you want it to be of course, and then you see that it's not that bad. But one thing I never* knew is that you might feel worried or anxious after you do an OCD treatment assignment, but repetition is important so OCD doesn't sink back in a little. If you do it a few times, you truly feel WAY better about it, like you don't care, like you're a normal person regarding that thing. And even after the first time, after a little time, you do feel better. And for me it was never as bad as it seemed. (This last thing just makes me not scared as much to do exposures because I remember thinking things were like gonna be the end of the world, and then I was fine with them and was normal about them.) It's also good to talk back to your OCD. Basically like the mindfulness thing. See what your thoughts and fears are and then talk back to it, like think about how it's irrational. Like that it is irrational, and you can even tell yourself why. I learned doing OCD things when they come to you, kind of like prevents your brain from getting the time to just think about it subconsciously and like irrationalize it. So give it that time. But also if one time fails, try again and again. Repetition when doing exposures or like not giving in to certain compulsions, and not just once a month, but enough so OCD doesn't sink back in and get you scared, really helps you eliminate that compulsion. And for me a lot of things seemed like an exception, and things still do but it's just OCD. It's just OCD.

"Hi
 I just wanted to share that I am very happy I have been discharged from therapy but still believe there's a long way to go.
I am aiming to put all the practices I was taught into place and some have been working already, in times under considerable stress.
My compulsions weigh heavy on my mind like right now as I am typing but I guess I just have to go down that rabbit hole, and see if a better life awaits, which I have desire and confidence will be.
Best to all

"The last few weeks have been really difficult. I've been off work since the start of December and I want so desperately to get back to work and normality. For every good day I have I tend to have a run of 2 or 3 bad days.
When I first relapsed in November my compulsion quickly became to constantly seek reassurance online. I don't think there's an article I haven't read, a website I haven't visited or a youtube video I haven't watched countless times, pretty soon my compulsion was taking up most of my day, still does to be honest.
I joined this forum hoping to be a help to others suffering and for advice myself at times of need but I'm worried that visiting the forum is now my new compulsion, my way of seeking further reassurance.
How can I ever improve on my situation if I'm constantly discussing and researching my illness when doing so is the very thing that gives it strength.
My wife is really starting to lose her patience, she's constantly catching me on my phone and she's well aware of what I'm doing. So much so that I've started hiding it when I hear her coming, it's getting a little ridiculous!

"Hi everyone. The first part ill start you out, is a copy and paste of my introduction
Hi All. I am 13 years old. I need help. Really bad. Im so stressed out, over stupid ****. I have extremely bad OCD. The type of OCD that involves excessive worrying, and worrying over redicilious things. If something is not perfect, I stress over it. I actually can't stop. Many nights I have been up all night, worrying about redicilious stuff, the little things.
I need to stop this now before this gets really bad. I'm just so stressed out right now. I've had OCD as long as I can remember, and its really impacting my life. I hope I can find people like me and we can talk about our experiences.
I worry of what people will think of me, I have bad anxiety problems. I have anxiety about small events, that will take place in Months, or a very long time from now.
Sincerely, A stressed out ocd sufferer
Now ill explain a bit more. I cannot stop changing things. If I choose something, I change it, because I find one little thing wrong with it. I used to have compulsions of movements, like head shaking, or looking at something a certain amount of times. But that has died off, and the panic/anxiety/perfection seeking has arisen. I fear death in everything. I also wonder, what are the chances of me dying? Is it really worth the risk?
I just need a stop to this. Its taking over my life. I always go with the popular choice of a group, because I don't want to be different. I can't accept that fact that I'm different in many things. I am only 13 years old. I shouldn't be struggling with this. I should be outside, hanging out with my friends, playing video games, having fun. But no, i can't. I worry, stress, all day long. And sometimes there will be times where it completely falls off, but the next day it comes back. Sometimes much worse. This problem has not deceased at all, in fact, its getting worse every week.
I just want to know how to stop this, and how I can stop striving for absolute perfection, and just have fun. And not care about what other people think. Not get anxiety over little things. Stop worrying obsessively over things that really don't matter. I need a stop to this, i'm hoping some of you can help me enjoy life again, and just be a kid.
Sincerely, Burnsy CEO

"So psychotherapy finally got in touch with me today after 1 year since I started seeing my current psychiatrist. After a 30 minute telephone assessment of my OCD (which by the way is chronic to the point where I spend 8 hours or more per day on compulsions) I was told 18 months until someone could help me. I also suffer horrible depression, likely due to the exhaustion of my OCD. 
Was just wondering what other people's current experiences were with waiting times for NHS therapy and whether it may related to my location. (South Wales). Obviously, it's covid times, but surely CBT can just be done over the phone. Perhaps more people need CBT now for covid related depression? Who knows. 
I understand that people who are self harming themselves or others or at risk of suicide take priority, but it's sad that myself and others are left to be in pain for such a long time by a system that would rather just medicate us instead of healing us properly. NHS please get more CBT staff!!!
Any recommendations to private therapists would be greatly appreciated. Not that I can afford it or anything.

"Hi all
I am new to the forum, and talking to people about my OCD but having read so many supportive and inspirational messages on here I think it is time for me to also feel supported and part of the community. 
  I have had many variations of OCD since I was 15, starting with contamination being the earliest I can remember. Its been immensely draining and I really don’t know where the time has gone but it passes by. Every day is a new day and therefore new potential for a new obsessive thought to intrude my mind. 
  I had to seek help during lockdown as I just could not function, I have been on sertraline for over 6 months with very minimal success. I am currently on 200mg and only now I can feel the edge is taken off my anxiety. 
I guess my issues are : 
I know its OCD, I’ve had CBT and exposure therapy, also read loads of resources- I know what it is, but as I went for so long having no treatment and just thinking why am I so weird - no one else is like me. I feel stuck, I know its all irrational but it feels like the habit of neutralising with the compulsions is second nature. 
I really do not know why my current rumination which has been the dominant thought for the past 5.5 years is even stuck? Its about my ex husbands new wife. Shes always in my head, my thoughts, I cant get her out unless I go through a variety of rituals which can take hours. 
I cant function as a normal person ie: do chores, or start some work, or start a new task because if I do she will contaminate it and it will be ruined cursed destroyed. I cant look in the mirror as she will contaminate my face and I will then get acne. Then my face feels like she’s contaminated me. 
  I mean wow Ive never actually written that in such a simplistic way. I am married again and I have been afraid for the past 5 years she will ruin my relationship. Infect it, disease it, ruin it. 
  But Im the one who has ruined so much by not living, holding back, I feel like I use 20% of my brain because of her. I cant even put a wash on because she will infect my clothes and then when I wear them she will be present. 
The more I think about it, I’ve no answer as to why I fear her so much. The only incident I can think of is she married my ex husband very soon after we separated, our marriage broke down as he was having an affair with someone else (not her). The next thing you know hes met his current wife (my source of fear) and she is defending him and his actions and she contacted me in response to something I put on social media about him saying that I will only know what it feels like when I have my own children- ie: what his parents have gone through as he is innocent etc, she believed his version of events over the facts. I do not have children as have not been able to conceive, is it because of her ill wishes towards me? I really do not know why I am so afraid of her when I have never physically spoken to her. Now I am seeking help, is it too late as I cannot shake off the habits of 5.5 years of this same thought.
  any advice, thoughts would be very welcome.

"Hey there.
I am 19y old and suffer from OCD, mainly """"Pure O"""" OCD. I was diagnosed in November of 2013 by my psychologist. At first I was diagnosed with depression and the beginning of 2013 but as my OCD worsened I finally got the courage to talk to my psychologist about it. When I was younger I never paid much attention to the compulsions; I just thought I had weird quirks. I am on medication to help me with my depression and OCD.","['compulsion', 'Thought', 'Medication', 'depression', 'OCD']",1,0,1,0,1,1
"I've tried to keep off forums as I know that I use them to seek reassurance which is bad. Plus my therapist said it's a bad idea... but I apparently can't help myself. Is this really pure-O, maybe reassurance seeking is my big compulsion?
I just can't seem stop doubting that it really is my ocd, and if it isn't then I'm obviously a total time-wasting screw-up. Yesterday night I got to the point of hysterical sobbing which I haven't done since things were really bad months back. Now I'm scared that maybe I'm getting bad again, I just don't think I can go back to that dark place again. Also I don't know if my bf can handle me like that again...
And to think it was all triggered by a guy I had a crush on (and still think is very attractive) posting an innocent comment on my facebook wall. Now I'm terrified of even going on facebook, convinced I'm going to break up with my bf and run off with this guy, or cheta on him, or something awful. Maybe I should just end this relationship, I clearly don't deserve someone who loves me like this when I'm too screwed up to feel anything but guilt and anxiety around him.
I feel so bloody guilty all the time and it's really taking it's toll. If I really loved my boyfriend why would I doubt it like this? Why can't things be like they used too? I'm sick and tired of this endless nightmare and I'm terrified of the truth... I made myself say outloud 'I don't love him' just to see how I'd feel. I almost cried again. Great, so I'm going nuts, again... I don't know what I want, I know reassurance is useless but I don't know what to do or who to talk to... christ I wish there was a magic pill or a time machine. I've screwed everything up so badly and I just can't seem to fix myself.

"Right I won’t waffle on as I’ve noticed I do that a lot in my posts(sorry ?) 
ny first question is with ERP I get that you’re suppose to make the thought appear in your head, I’ve noticed though when I’ve put the thought there myself it doesn’t bother me so I can’t really let my anxiety get too high as I knew it was coming. Where as if a thought appears without me thinking about it that’s when my anxiety rockets high. So do I continue to put the thought into my head or change it and wait for the thought to appear when I’m not expecting it and then use the exposure methods?
  My second is I have this habit of doing a compulsion, so as you know I have thoughts about abusing my daughter, one of my compulsions is to touch her nappy just to get rid of the thought( I never actually touch her inappropriately just to put that out there in case someone got the wrong idea, just when she’s got her nappy on/dressed)
I’d been doing completely fine until today when I ended up doing so without fully realising, I think it did it out of habit to be honest, I know I’ve got to break the habit, so what I also wanted to know was when I accidentally do a compulsion do I just need to let go of the fact I did it and just make sure I don’t do it again and distract myself from doing it? As I’ve found now I’m sitting here getting angry at myself for doing the compulsion and I’m just constantly worrying as to why I did it, which I understand is classed ruminating. It’s just hard to tell which ones I should and shouldn’t ruminate about.

http://www.wsps.info/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=141:25-tips-for-succeeding-in-your-ocd-therapy&catid=0
By Fred Penzel, Ph.D.
1. Always expect the unexpected - you can have an obsessive thought any time or any place. Don’t be surprised when old or even new ones occur. Don‘t let it throw you. Be prepared to use your therapy tools at any time, and in any place. Also, if new thoughts appear, be sure to tell your therapist, to keep them informed.
2. Be willing to accept risk. All life is risky business. Risk is an integral part of life, and as such, it cannot be separated out. Remember that not recovering is the biggest risk of all.
3. Never seek reassurance from yourself or others. Instead, tell yourself the worst will happen, is happening, or has already happened. Reassurance will cancel out the effects of any homework you use it on and prevent you from improving. Reassurance-seeking is a compulsion, no matter how you may try to justify it.
4. Always try hard to agree with all obsessive thoughts - never analyze, question, or argue with them. The questions they raise are not real questions, and there are no real answers to them. Try not to get too elaborate when agreeing – simply say the thoughts are true and real.
5. Don’t waste time trying to prevent or not think your thoughts.This will only have the opposite effect and lead to thinking more thoughts. Studies have shown that you cannot effectively suppress particular thoughts. Your motto should be, “If you want to think about them less, think about them more.”
6. If you slip and do a compulsion, you can always turn it around and do something to cancel it. Try to not be a black-and-white all-or-nothing thinker who tells themselves that they are now a total failure. The good news is that you are in this for the long haul, and you always get another chance. It is normal to make mistakes when learning new skills, especially in therapy. It happens to everyone now and then. Accept it.Even if you have a good sized setback, don’t let it throw you. Remember the saying, “A lapse is not a relapse.” This means that you never really go back to square one. To do that, you would have to forget everything you have learned up to that point, and that really isn’t possible. Also remember the sayings, “Never confuse a single defeat with a final defeat,” (F. Scott Fitzgerald) and as they say in AA, “You can always start your day over.”
7. Remember that dealing with your symptoms is your responsibility alone. Don't involve others in your homework (unless specifically told to) or expect them to push you or to provide the motivation. They won’t always be there when you need them, but you are always with you.
8. Don’t get too impatient with your rate of progress, or compare yourself to someone else. Everyone progresses at their own particular rate. Try, instead, to simply focus on carrying out each day’s homework, one day at a time.
9. When you have a choice, always go toward the anxiety, never away from it. The only way to overcome a fear is to face it. You can’t run away from your own thoughts, so you really have no choice but to face them. If you want to recover, you will have to do this eventually.
10. When faced with two possible choices of what to confront, always choose the more difficult of the two whenever possible.
11. Review your therapy homework assignments daily, even if you think you know all of them. It is easy to overlook them – especially the ones you don’t look forward to doing.
12. If your therapist gives you an assignment you don’t feel ready to do, don’t be shy about saying so. As half of the team, you should be able to have a say in your own therapy. The goal is for the homework to produce moderate anxiety you can get used to tolerating - not to overwhelm you with it and cause you a setback. On the other hand, don’t be afraid to stretch yourself a bit whenever you can.
13. Procrastination is a feature of many people’s OCD, so start your homework assignments the day you get them. Don’t wait for the perfect moment to start. The perfect moment is whenever you begin doing them.
14. Perfectionism can be another feature of OCD. You may find your OCD telling you that if you don’t do your homework perfectly, you won’t recover. If you do find yourself obsessing about having to do your homework perfectly, you risk turning it into another compulsion. Watch out for having to do your homework according to the same rigid rules each time you do it. Also, don’t do your homework so excessively that it takes up your whole day. Remember that you still have a life to live.
15. Make the effort to read over your homework assignments at the start of each day. Don’t assume that you know them all and will not forget them.
16. Be careful when carrying out assignments to not undo them by telling yourself that “It’s only homework, and the things I’m saying and doing don’t count and aren’t real,” or “My therapist wouldn’t ask me to do something that would cause harm to me or others,” or “I’m only doing this because I was told to, so I’m not responsible for anything bad that happens.”
17. Try to not let yourself get distracted and tune out when doing certain assignments, so that you don’t have to feel the anxiety. People sometimes let the homework become routine and do it in a very automatic way as a kind of avoidance.Also, don’t do homework while you carry out other distracting activities. Give it your full attention, focus on what you are doing, and let yourself feel the anxiety. You are building tolerance to what you fear and for that to happen, you have to be in the moment with it.
18. When faced with a challenging assignment or an unexpected challenging situation, try to look on it as a positive, and as another opportunity to get better instead of saying, “Oh, no.Why do I have to do this?” Tell yourself, “This will be good for me – another chance to practice and get stronger.”
19. Try to not rush through your therapy homework so that you don’t have to feel as much anxiety. Take your time, and see if you can view it in terms of all the good it will do you. Getting it over with as quickly as possible is not the goal. Raising a moderate level of anxiety and staying with it, is.
20. If your homework doesn’t really produce any anxiety, tell your therapist about it. If your exposure homework doesn’t cause at least some anxiety, it isn’t going to be effective in helping you. On the other hand, try doing all new assignments for at least a week before deciding that they don’t make you anxious. Some assignments can cause delayed reactions and it may take doing them a few times before the anxiety occurs.
21. It is sometimes possible for OCD to try to make you doubtful about your homework. It may tell you that you are not in the right treatment, that your assignments cannot possibly make you better, or that you really don’t understand what you are doing and won’t be able to make it work. Remember that OCD was known as The Doubting Disease, and will try to cast doubt on anything that is important to you. To fight this, you may have to agree with it by saying, “Yes, that’s right. I really won’t get better.”
22. Never forget that you have OCD. This means that you will not always be able to trust your own reactions or sensations, especially if they seem to be telling you very negative and extreme things. If you are unsure if something is really a symptom, treat it as a symptom. Better to err on the side of doing a bit more exposure than not enough.
23. Remember that in OCD, the problem is not the anxiety - the problem is the compulsions. If you think the anxiety is the problem, you will only do more compulsions to get rid of it (which will only create more anxiety). If you recognize that the compulsions are the problem, stop doing them, and stay with the fearful situation, then the anxiety will eventually subside as you build up tolerance.
24. Always take a moment to endorse your own efforts and recognize your successes. It’s a good way to help keep up your motivation. Look back at earlier assignments that are no longer challenging if you believe you aren’t making progress.
25. Overall, never forget that OCD is very paradoxical. The things that you thought would make you better, only made you worse, and the things you thought would make you worse are the very things that will make you better.","['surprise', 'site', 'Treatment', 'disease', 'fear', 'compulsion', 'OCD', 'Thought', 'anxiety', 'anxiety', 'symptom']",1,0,1,1,0,0
"Hi All,
Had my second psych appt today. Was absolutely terrified about it, but forced myself to go. It was a bit weird as she didn't really ask me any questions about how I was feeling, or how I was managing with the compulsions etc. It was really clinical and just asked questions about the medication. She recommended increasing dose and going back to see her in three months.
....It was all a bit of an anti-climax really, considering how stressed out I was about the whole thing. Is this a normal reaction following psych appointments?

I'm 3 weeks into my 20mg fluoxetine medication and I must admit I feel a little better. The pills initially played my stomach up, but I'm over that now. I feel a little better, but am still having repetitive thoughts, but the compulsions seem to have lessened somewhat.

"One Part of Jeffery Schwartz's 4 Steps is - after acknowledging that an intrusive thought is caused by OCD - to (try to) do something enjoyable in order not to give in to your compulsions. In CBT (with ERP) you deliberately expose yourself to the stressor. So we have """"Working around"""" vs. """"Exposition""""? Aren't these approaches contradictory? Is """"Working around"""" not similar to """"Avoid""""?

This is a first for me, i have had ocd since i was thirteen and now im 51.i used to keep thinking and going over thoughts in my head all the time about normal kid like things,to the point where it was making me ill and had to take time out from school because of this. my parents at the time could not work out what was wrong with me,and nor could i.i did eventually have some comfort with talking to a head teacher about my silly mind games,and that did seem to help at the time(maybe that was the first act of avoidance on my behalf)
All the way through my teens and into my early twenties i was allways checking things like,did i lock the door is the gas cooker of, and anything else i thought i had missed.i even got my friends to repeat what they had said to me sometimes,as to here it again even though i new what they had just told me.
By my mid twenties things started getting worse for me,thinking that i had caused harm to somebody in a shop,and also thinking i had run somebody over in the road. all this type of thinking made me always go back and check to see if i had done something wrong.
By now my ocd was in full swing as i now startid having low level thoughts about harming people that i could not hold down relationships with girlfriends,i remember one day i had to come home to my parents as my whole body seemed to be seizing up, because my nervous system must have gone into overdrive with the constant rheumanating.
it was only about20 yrs ago that i finaly found out what was wrong with me, i read an article in a magazine about this poor chap thinking he had killed somebody,and obviously had not,to being diagnosed with ocd.
This helped me a lot as i new from then this torment was an illness.
i still get bouts of ocd, as my type now seems to be mental checking with not much physical compulsions involved.
the part i struggle with is the depression and low state of mind it leaves you in when you get a bout of ocd.
Thanks for reading this as sometimes its good to share....

"Hi
My son was diagnossed with OCD a few weeks ago. He has always been a bit obsessive about things but my father in law died from Cancer a few months ago and since then my son has got much worse. Everything has to be in order, he hoards junk, won't let me clean his room and has to fold all his clothes neatly every night and lay them out in order. Everytime he writes something (e.g Christmas cards) he has to go over the writing again after he has written it. Funnily enough it doesn't seem to be a problem at school but he says he has to count in his head at school to stop him carrying out his compulsions in the classroom.
My son has been feferred for congnetive therapy and possibly medication but apparently there is a wait of at least 2 months and in the meantime he seems to get worse every day. He is our only child but my husband and I both work full time and have many other family commitments at the moment so we don't have enough time in the day as it is and our Sons OCD is driving us to despair. My husband gets so frustrated that he has to leave me to deal with it a lot of the time as he is worried he will lash out and hurt him. I try my best but feel completly drained and unable to cope. sometimes I loose control and shout at my son but then I feel like the worst mother in the world. I know he needs so much reassurance right now but sometimes I just don't know what to do when he is getting upset and has to carry out his compulsions. I hate seeing him like this and I feel like other members of the family blame our parenting skills for the way he is. My own mother died 15 years ago and my sister doesn't have children so I tend to talk about my problems to work colleagues who I think are just about sick of my problems now so I bottle everything up but feel so alone.
If anyone has any tips for coping when their child is struggling with their compulsions I would be very very grateful.","['writing', 'Medication', 'despair', 'OCD', 'compulsion']",1,0,1,1,1,0
"Many of us do know what we need to be doing change wise , but actually doing it and building up a head of steam needs commitment. 
So why not look for an incentive to kick-start the process. 
Watch out for creating a compulsion though, that won't help. 
I don't feel physically well today, the result of anxiety - so I am feeling washed out and my adrenalin glands ache from overuse. Dark bags under the eyes no doubt 
But I need to get up and get doing, and getting involved in good helpful things and easing down the angst. Encouraging positivity. So I plan to: 
Doze for another hour, just gently and calmly. 
Get up in a mindful way, enjoying a wash, the taste of the toothpaste, the joy of choosing my clothes. Add a little male jewellery, a drop of scent. 
Get out to the local cafe and mix with my friends there ( my normal reaction when I feel OCD bad is avoiding others) , come back prepare a shopping list for the supermarket, then catch the bus (an exposure for me)  and go shopping. 
If I achieve this I might just reward myself with a light lunch out? 
What can you do to stand up to the disorder today?

"ill try to put this into words as best i can so please forgive me if i waffle on.
ok, i need to put some things in an exact position,
if i dont, i feel uncomftable and sometimes i get a bit ticcy,
ive read that most ocd'ers feel that if they dont they feel something bad will happen,
is that a description of feeling uncomftable or is it literal?
and as i dont """"think"""" that something bad will happen does that mean its not ocd?
if the object doesnt go how i feel it should go i get very aggitated.
things have to be done the """"right"""" way, there is eiher a right way or a wrong way, i dont make the rules for this,
my wife was peeling potatoes, i moan at her she is doing it wrong,
is that ocd or ocpd or just me?
i doubt my ocd at times,
i get bad thoughts, which i dont so much find disturbing, even though they are disturbing,
mostly sexual,
more annoying that they wont go away,
also if my wife takes too long at the shop i start to imagine all sorts of things,
death unfathfullness, and i fantasise my whole life out,
but it makes me feel low whilst thinking it,
that is ocd?
i ruminate,
if ive had a conversation with someone ill play it out in my mind for most of the day, sometimes days after.
or if im due to meet someone or have an appointment, like with the doctor,
ill play the conversation in my mind over and over until the appointment,
then after again too a little,
ocd?
the hearing blasphemy thing (i have a thought ritual after but if the blapshemy goes on it makes me worse) i know is ocd,
i dont get physical compulsions, except the door bolts have to face to heaven or it will let evil in,
i have to wipe toilet seats with tissue, and wont sit on a public loo,
dont like my hands getting dirty, dont like my face being touched.
reading this back to myself, i feel daft cos it does sound like ocd,
but is all of it ocd?
most of you seem to have it worse than me and i often feel like a whiner compared to you lot.
spose i just need a little reasurance.
i have to be in control is another.

"Hi, 
I hope you are all doing okay. I'm back with another long post.
As I've mentioned in my previous posts I struggle with the fear of being attracted to children, including my brother who is 8 years old. It has been a really hard year, and despite the fact that I've been diagnosed with OCD, there are days, like today, when I find this diagnosis completely wrong or unacceptable (no offense to doctors and specialists in OCD). 
My last (online) meeting with my doctor was last week. The meeting and the few days after that went pretty well compared to other days which are hell. However, for the past 3 days I've been getting pretty weird and disgusting incestuous thoughts (they are however more like feelings and urges) about parents and their children. This is not a new thing for me, I had to deal with this a few months ago, but didn't pay too much attention to it. I guess it's back now...
If I see a parent and her/his child walking by our house, I get a response in my body that almost feels like excitement; or even worse the response feels pleasurable. I can't unsee this sick relationship anymore. I can't see a normal parent-child relationship that doesn't involve sexual stuff whenever I'm in specific situations. And it happens with everyone. It happens when I see my mum cuddling my brother, my boyfriend talking to his mum, my neighbour playing football with his two sons. There was a time when I was convinced that it was OCD, because the thoughts and feelings were unwanted and caused a huge amount of distress. However, for the past 3 days it's been terrible in terms that all this doesn't cause as much distress as it used to; I don't feel bad when I get the thoughts and feelings, but I do feel bad afterwards (I'm not sure if this means something though). Sometimes, it even seems that I enjoy the feeling. Also, there are moments when I get weird urges, and it's like I want the thoughts to become true because the response in my body is very strong; as I'm typing it feels like I do want them to happen/become true.
There is another important bit that I would like to add: the urges also happen whenever I hear about something bad/terrible happening in the world. For example, if the news talk about victims of a sex offender, I immediately get a similar response in my body (as the one mentioned earlier) alongside strong urges - again, it feels like I want those or similar situations to happen. Also, I feel a immense amount of guilt whenever I hear about this type of news, and it makes me feel even more disgusting. 
Apparently, both my mind and body are two incredibly repulsive places, and I haven't realised that until I've written these paragraphs.
So, to summarise I'm in huge doubt that all I've mentioned above can be classified as OCD because of the following:
I don't feel bad or disgusted enough when I get all these thoughts, body reactions and urges
         -  the opposite is what actually happens: it feels like I enjoy them and wouldn't mind experiencing them in real life;.
         -  their presence has significantly increased and now happen all the time; sometimes I think about them on purpose;
         -  they seem too dark and disgusting to be part of OCD;
         -  if I try to ignore them, it feels like denial. 
I don't really know what the role of this post is. I'm pretty sure I'm either trying to confess or ask for reassurance. I know they are big compulsions, especially if I have OCD, but I couldn't resist posting on here as I think this is something really important and serious.
Thank you for reading this, and any help would be more than appreciated!
Hope you have a nice and calm evening.","['fear', 'talking', 'guilt', 'site', 'role', 'compulsion', 'hope', 'joy', 'disgust', 'Thought', 'urge', 'OCD']",1,0,1,1,1,1
"Hi! I hope you are well! I battle OCD & generalised anxiety. Over the past 2 years I have done a few mindfulness courses & practice mindfulness meditation. I attend my local Buddhist centre once a week & really enjoy it.
Last week I spent an hour chatting to an ordained Buddhist monk from the centre. He has been practicing meditation for 15 years
I told him about my ocd & generalised anxiety & he gave me advice & a Buddhist perspective.
1) The Spike: When my ocd spikes/triggers & I am tempted to panic, start ruminating etc...he advised that when this happens, I should focus in on my breath. The inbreath & the outbreath. Then I move from there to being with/in my body. Feeling the sensations. The ocd thought is there, & I am 100% aware of it, but I don't follow it, panic, ruminate, question it...I just watch it...
'Oh there's my OCD thought....'
We live & be in the moment, even with a nasty ocd thought!
2)Meditation Practice. To really achieve a mindful state, we have to practice meditation a lot. After a course learning how to meditate, we need to practice at least 30/40 mins everyday.
He recommended a) Mindfulness of the Breath & b) The Metta Bhavana meditations on alternate days.
When we build up our practice, we can drop back into this mediatative state at any time of the day.
We are in our own bodies, following our own breath and watching our minds and thoughts in action.
3)We have to develop a kindness, respect for and love for ourselves. When we meditate & our mind wanders we dont criticise or harrass ourselves; we become our own best friend.
When we are in the midst of an OCD storm we practice our mindfulness, aware of how tough it is & how brave we are. If we fail to become mindful & our OCD carries us away, we dont beat ourself up. Just move on with our day & try again to be mindful.
Living in this moment as it unfolds. Not regretting the past and not worrying about or wishing for something in the future.
All we have is this moment & now.
Our anxiety & ocd makes us worry about the future & bemoan the past & we miss life going on right around us!
4) Buddhist outlook on thoughts. In Buddhism thoughts and feelings are just thoughts and feelings.
We have no control over them. They fire and spark continuously throughout the day. We cannot stop them or stem the tide.
But once we have a thought/feeling...now we have control about the next step.
We can and have power and a choice to refuse to respond to a thought or feeling.
There is a gap between a thought and what happens next. We can make this gap bigger & bigger by practicing meditation. We can be mindful at the moment of an ocd spike & refuse to go down the old road of rumination/questioning & compulsions.
In Buddhist Philosophy there are no morals/ethics attached to thoughts: they dont make us bad people and they dont mean we are likely/more likely to do whatever we think. Ethics/morals only come into question at the point of acting on thoughts.
Thinking something scary, freaky, disgusting, distasteful, horrible does not make us bad people. The are and always will be just thoughts
Everyone in life has the same thoughts as us example:
a) What if I stab my Mum, partner, child.
b) What if I shout out something crazy.
c) What if I murder, rape, assault, abuse a child, a loved one, animal etc etc etc ......
All just thoughts!
5) Anxiety: The monk advised when anxiety arrives, try not to block or fight it. Instead turn towards it. As anxiety builds, move your attention inwards to your body; feel your heart pumping, hands shaking, stomach churning...feel every bit of it...flow with it...dont run from it.
Then invariably the anxiety abates/dissipates.
It is like being stuck in quicksand: if you fight; you sink...however, if you lie back and relax, you will pop out of the sand.
So there you go: this is the advice I got: he was a really nice guy and freely gave over an hour of his time to chat about my difficulties: I really appreciated it!

"Hi
I'm 23 and I've been an OCD sufferer my entire life but have only recently become aware of the extent the condition has damaged my quality of life. For as long as I can remember I've had compulsions about small things and OCD of varying different types, including HOCD, sporadic cleanliness, order, repeatedly reloading video games when things aren't perfect, compulsively avoiding reading nasty things so I don't dwell on them later etc. Until now I've never told another soul about this and always been firm in the belief that I could handle it on my own. Eventually all the compulsion and worries have passed until now, which is why I'm reaching out for help. 
I'm a masters student at university and currently under quite a lot of stress during deadline season when I've been hit by an absolute freight train of OCD regret specifically relating to my relationship. It's so bad I haven't eaten or slept properly for the past few days and need any available advice. I have been an extremely sexually repressed individual. It was a topic that wasn't discussed in my house growing up and I started masturbating at a late age and incorrectly. I suffered from prone masturbatory syndrome that I didn't self cure until my gap year and I also had to have a penile frenuloplasty to correct tight foreskin in the same year. I'd had a terrible time at high school having gone through an 'ugly' phase and been badly bullied to the extent that I considered killing myself. As a consequence I'd had no sexual contact by the time I arrived at university. 
When I arrived at Uni I was obviously interested in sex but never managed to have it in my first year. I was lucky in that I'd become better looking since high school and a few attractive girls were interested. I came close but never gone through with it always having performance anxiety. I was anxious (OCD anxious now I remember it) about sex. By the end of first year I was happy, having made a bunch of friends but sexually I was very frustrated. I'd discovered porn while there and used it to help me relieve my frustrations. In second year is where the regret is. At the start I was invited by a girl to go back to hers but due to anxiety and being incredibly drunk couldn't get aroused. I became depressed and wish I’d sought professional help. Instead, I did something I really regret. While at a friends house after a night out that I'd had a big crush on in the past I was left alone in her room. I was looking around and noticed her underwear on her laundry and had a look at it, having little experience with ladies' underwear. I didn't steal them but I took pictures and later masturbated to them. I’d done this once before a couple of months previously with a house-mates underwear that had been left outside my room but didn’t take any pictures. Even then I felt ashamed and deleted the pictures shortly afterwards. This now disgusts me. 
Later that year I met my current girlfriend. She was beautiful and had an amazing personality and really hit it off after she initially acted weirdly around me, having had bad uni relationships in the past. We started dating in late Feb and I knew this is who I wanted to lose my virginity to and eventually the moment came and once again nerves got the better of me after putting the condom on. I was utterly devastated and my anxiety spiralled out of control. I was afraid of losing her but at the same time hadn't told her the truth about being a virgin. The pressure crushed me and I didn't behave well going through a phase of ‘testing’ my sexuality. One of the ways I acted was by flirting with friends who were girls to boost my esteem. I think because at the time everyone at uni was cheating on each other this didn't seem like a bad thing, even though I deeply regret it now. I made it explicit to the girls I flirted with that I would never cheat and I didn't. But on extremely rare occasions there was inappropriate touching like a hand on waist etc. On one of these occasions my girlfriend saw me and I think assumed I wanted to cheat which I made emphatically clear I didn't. At the same time I bought viagra from the Internet to help with the problem and almost had a heart attack in my girlfriend’s bathroom. Something which seems funny now but wasn't at the time. Things had gotten out of control and the worst OCD guilt comes from being in my friends room again. I seem to remember her underwear being on her laundry again and me picking it up. I cannot accurately date this event but I know it happened and that it was different. I wasn't aroused and I think I was testing myself again, to see what I found sexually attractive. I don't remember taking a picture this time, if I did I deleted it quickly or I'd remember but this event horrifies me. I just don't know what I could have been thinking to do such a thing. Over the summer things got better. I told my girlfriend I was a virgin and it felt like a huge pressure off me. The last time I flirted at all was that October at the start of the new academic year when out extremely drunk and then I made it emphatic to the girl I wouldn't cheat and didn't. 
Its been a year and a half since and I've never cheated or flirted and always been firm when girls have come on to me out etc. My girlfriend did her year abroad and this fourth year I've fallen incredibly deeply in love with her. We are extremely close and never fight. With her my OCD symptoms have even all but disappeared, it's only now that I’ve been alone for weeks shut up working that they have returned. We haven't had sex yet but I've stopped watching porn and masturbating and am ready to take our relationship to a sexual level with her after finally becoming comfortable but that's when the guilt hit. For the first time in years I could have nothing to be anxious about but I can't stop thinking about the past and confessing to all my mistakes. Those first few months when I was so anxious and stupid. I never intended to cheat or hurt her in any way and though I knew I'd behaved badly and would change it if I could I'd all but forgotten about it until now. Those events had no emotional significance for me, it was just a bad way to deal with the overwhelming stress I felt at the time. 
Over the past few days the OCD guilt has crippled me. I can't complete my work and I've barely eaten or slept. It goes without saying that I would never behave that way ever again but at the same time I feel the urge to confess the mistakes I made. I'm so close to having everything I've ever wanted with a woman I absolutely adore and I'm not sure if telling her these things would destroy that. I think ultimately she'd understand but she'd never look at me the same way again and I'd desperately want to spare her any pain. This confession could change my life and it'll hurt her which I'd hate to do but maybe it's better to be honest?
Any advice would be hugely appreciated from anyone who took the time to read that. Thanks","['quality', 'outside', 'shame', 'disgust', 'bathroom', 'fall', 'symptom', 'urge', 'compulsion', 'interest', 'anxiety', 'anxiety', 'guilt', 'regret', 'OCD']",1,0,1,0,1,1
"I've been doing really well with my therapy and recovery, but seem to have had a rocky week. I did a lot of compulsions today and I'm feeling a bit down, but I won't let myself be angry at myself and ruminate about giving in to compulsions.
I'm going to go """"so what?"""" and try to enjoy my weekend the best I can and get back on the horse. We can do this.

"Hi -
So I haven't been on here since December since I was recovering. I've been on prozac since I was 18 (now 24) for depression but I was diagnosed with OCD in January. My psych bumped me up to a higher dosage of prozac - 80mg - which was doing a great job. But I wanted to go off of it because it was making me gain weight and now I'm freaking out!! My OCD revolves around cheating like some of you know...and my most recent """"obsession"""" (I put quotes around it cuz i question whether its an obsession or if its real) is that... well let me start from the beginning. I went to my fiancé's friends place and we all had a few drinks and played card games and such. I was with my fiance the whole time except for when I went to the bathroom. I remember everything from the night despite the alcohol in my system. We came home and continued drinking (just me and my fiance) and I eventually blacked out. I ended up having a dream about cheating on my partner with someone that I had seen earlier that night (well not really cheating just taking the guys hands and placing them in an odd place). But it's just that image in my head nothing else. I don't really remember waking up from it to realize it was a dream, I think I stirred but then went right back to sleep (i dont even remember)...I keep thinking what if it wasn't a dream what if it actually happened? My fiance keeps telling me he was with me the whole time and nothing happened but I think about the dream/image all day and it's driving me nuts! I always question whether I really have OCD or not and if the doc just diagnosed me to make me feel better and everything is true and real??? I have an appt with my psych tomorrow and I think I am going to have him write me a script for Zoloft...apparently it is an SSRI that doesn't cause weight gain. SSRI's are the only thing that seem to help me to accept uncertainty, but the thing that bothers me is I've never been able to say yes or no to the thoughts...but when I'm on the medication I'm kind of just like eh whatever and then the thought goes away. When I'm not I have crying spells and can't concentrate and just obsess and cry all day in the bathroom at work and also I get really bad separation anxiety from my fiance. Anyway I'm kind of just rambling just wanted to vent. Hope everyone is doing okay.","['depression', 'weight gain', 'Medication', 'anxiety', 'anxiety', 'hope', 'obsession', 'bathroom', 'Thought', 'OCD']",0,1,0,1,0,1
"Hi all, hope you're all having a wonderful bank holiday whatever it is you're doing😎 I however am taking an introverted approach and just chilling and if you're reading this I thank you for taking your time out to read my first post on this forum and giving it some notice. I've taken some time out to read others experiences relating to OCD and other mental illnesses, knowing that I am not alone and gaining more insight to a really important topic and by reading other people's stories, by doing this I find that I'm learning more about myself as well. Some made me laugh, some made me cry. But thankyou nonetheless. What a great, lovely bunch of people. 
Just to add a little context, I'm a 21 year old male, recently come to terms with the fact I have OCD. As well as this I also have GAD, major depression and an eating disorder. 
Not getting into too much detail about the discovery of my OCD. Although rather impactful, it in some way has helped me knowing that there is a reason I am the way I am. I'm aware to not use the term 'Pure O' as it's not a medically used term and it is exactly the same as the more commonly known OCD subtypes. My compulsions are mainly in the mind. The themes are around harm, pedophilia, relationships, sexuality, existential, incest, depression and unfortunately the list goes on with various different themes. I've been having these thoughts for what it seems almost all my life. I always thought there was something wrong with me. When I was around 15/16, when I got into a conversation with a friend about mental illnesses. I knew from then on what I had to do, I had to diagnose myself with whatever it is that is wrong with me and I had to then give myself CBT before I get thrown in a loony bin or reported to the police as a danger or even worse, before I could act on them thoughts. For 6 years, that has been my mission. I thought, my intrusive thoughts were a part of me just waiting to burst out at any random moment. I thought that someday I'm going to wake up, something would switch in my brain and I would either black out and forget what I had done or even more frighteningly, actually be completely aware and actually taking pleasure in said scenarios based around my intrusive thoughts. I thought I had a monster, living inside me, just waiting for its perfect time to attack. I wouldn't know it until I knew it.
I have lived (and still live) in complete fear that I am my thoughts and they are a tremendous flaw in my personality. I guess I'm still yet to convince myself that it is true but as you all know, you have your ups and downs with this ever so painful disorder. It has been difficult to me, as Im coming to terms with having OCD, I am currently piecing together all my symptoms and all the intrusive thoughts I've ever had throughout my life. It's like they've all come back at me and I'm in a bit of a pickle. But, I will be getting help very soon, just waiting to find a specialist in OCD and CBT in the Sheffield area and I will be making steps to make my life manageable again as I seemed to of gone off the rails after some family related issues and the breakdown of my relationship with my amazing ex girlfriend. And I am hopeful, even though I am actually scared. And admitting to being scared is something I've never done, even though scared is what I've been all my life. However, opening up to my loved ones about my thoughts, I have received nothing but love, support and compassion and honestly... That's what I was most scared of, their reaction to my thoughts, and in that moment I knew that I had lived in fear for too long. They're heartbroken I'm going through this and have been for a long time, but only because they see me for what I don't. A normal, human being. Just like everyone else on this forum, or reading the forum. You're all normal, at least to us. And take comfort in that as did I when I came across these posts. 
There's a lyric that I've always been attached to, by a band called Meshuggah (shout out to all metal heads on this forum) and I'd love to share it. 
'The struggle to free myself from restraints, becomes my very shackles.' 
I hope that whoever reads this post, whether youre someone who has been diagnosed with OCD for years or someone who is finding answers. Please know you're not alone in this. And it will and can get better because ultimately you deserve it and you ought to have the drive to go out there and do it. Because you are not your thoughts. You know what you are, just look a little deeper, and you'll see you for the beautiful person you are, because all you're doing and all I'm doing, is our own disorderly way of protecting us from the things we fear the most. 
Have a good one guys. Enjoy the glorious weather. Thankyou so much.","['compulsion', 'anger', 'symptom', 'compassion', 'joy', 'depression', 'hope', 'fear', 'OCD', 'Intrusive thoughts', 'Thought']",1,1,1,1,1,1
"Hi, 
First, I hope everyone managed to have some joy and happiness this Christmas, especially those who are struggling a lot at the moment. 
Second, this post is going to be weird so I apologise.
Today I realised something very important. I realised that I actually am a bad person. When I look around I see normal and kind people; when I look at myself I see something disguting and weird (but not in a good way). This sounds silly but I received lots of presents today (I've never received so many before) and I felt so guilty. I don't deserve good things or people in my life. 
Besides the fears of being attracted to children and being an abuser, I realised that I have so many other small obsessions. And they are absolutely disgusting. Take today for example. While having a nap with my boyfriend I had the feeling that I raped him by touching him in a weird way (by accident) and not doing anything about it for 30 seconds or so. While playing with my boyfriend's sister's cats I felt some sort of sick joy; I don't know if that was because I thought they were cute or because of something else. And these are only two examples, but there are so, so, so many other things that make me feel like a deviant and monster. My brain and body are so repugnant because they are the house of some of the most abnormal thoughts and feelings about the most normal things in the world, which automatically makes me a monster. And things would probably be easier if I were sure I didn't like all these feelings and thoughts, but here is the thing: I'm not sure. On the contrary, I think I do like and enjoy them, and I'm just too scared to accept it hence pretend to be scared, anxious and worried about it.
I think there is something seriously wrong with me. I'm a terrible person and I can feel it - I know this sounds weird but I can actually feel it.

"Hello everyone. I could really use your help right now in identifying whether this is another OCD obsession or just my mind being corrupt
I hav suffered before with OCD obsessions about harming my family and it was the worst experience of my life. I did get treatment in the form of CBT and this helped. However, after my A level exams (which were STRESSFULL) my OCD has returned and now I obsess over harm, inappropriately touching people etc.
Apart from this, a new obsession has come. Whenever I see any young child laughing or playing or just sitting (usually my 8 year old cousin who visits us) I start to have intrusive thought about negative experiences in my own childhood. My father was an alcoholic which left me with very panicky experiences. I get really distressed by thesehorrible reminders and I do cry.
As a result, I avoid playing with my cousin at all costs so don't have to dwell on my own childhood and feel depressed. However, just seeing my cousin once brings these horrible memories which are followed by on-going thoughts in my mind that tell me
'I'm hopeless due to my childhood', 'I will never amount to anything' and 'My childhood made me this way'.
Please help me. I need to know if this is another OCD obsession so I can find some peace of mind and know its not me being a bitter and twisted idiot.
So is this OCD???","['Treatment', 'hope', 'Thought', 'obsession', 'OCD']",0,1,0,1,0,1
"Though it comes in many flavors, one of the more common OCD themes we see on the forum is that of (no) crime and punishment. I wrote it that way for a reason. The sufferer believes they made an egregious mistake or have even committed a crime (what they did was so terrible), yet everyone else on the forum responds that no such crime exists or that the mistake is nothing to worry about. This theme has one thing in common: the sufferer's steadfast determination to punish themselves for the perceived transgression.
Many times someone will raise an issue like this on the forum, then vehemently stick to the belief that the situation has nothing to do with OCD. We see it so often here one would have to wonder how it could not be OCD, since the posts appear on an OCD forum. Further, people with this particular theme often have other, more easily identifiable versions of OCD, lending credence to the belief that the current problem is also OCD.
The main reason why people balk at the thought that OCD is involved is that the situation (the crime) was real. OCD apparently didn't have any part in the formation of the crime/mistake. While that appears to be true in most cases of this theme, the person nonetheless is dealing with OCD now. Real mistakes or errors in judgment or perceived crimes can happen in real life. OCD comes into play when the person becomes overly focused on the mistake/crime/error to the detriment of their ability to live a quality life.
Sometimes the 'crime' took place recently. In many cases it happened years and years ago but suddenly popped into the mind of the OCD sufferer. In all cases sufferers with this theme become obsessed with what happened. They fixate on the alleged crime and can't shake it from their mind. The thought of what happened (obsession) causes distress. And the sufferer performs compulsions, most notably ruminating -- going over the event in their mind repeatedly.
A notable manifestation of this theme is the very common belief that the crime/mistake/error made in the past is absolutely terrible. Sufferers commonly come across as being devastated that they made such a mistake, which they believe is life changing. Interestingly, the nearly unanimous verdict of responders to threads about this OCD theme is that the crime/mistake/error appears to be minor in origin and not worth worrying about.
One by-product of this OCD theme and the way it manifests is what can be an overwhelming feeling of guilt. As everyone should know, OCD involves obsessions (intrusive thoughts) that cause distress. With this theme the majority of that distress is expressed as guilt. Consquently, sufferers with this theme commonly believe that they should be/must be punished for their transgression. This is expressed in self loathing comments and an interest shown in confessing the transgression to loved ones/the police.
Other people look at the situations and see they are minor incidents that should be dismissed, but the sufferers of this theme truly believe it is a case of crime and required punishment. Attempts at reassuring sufferers that they did not do bad, that they are not bad and that they deserve no punishment usually fall on deaf ears.
Like with other OCD themes, sufferers of this theme are their own worst enemies. Although the obsessions (thoughts that the sufferer did wrong) can be fleeting and last only seconds, sufferers can spend hours and hours ruminating on the subject. They can perform other compulsions, such as searching the Internet for stories of people who similarly screwed up, searching to find out what truly bad people do as a way of comparison, seeking reassurance and confessing.
Interestingly, with this OCD theme, the reassurance seeking can be the reverse of what is normally seen. While some people may ask for reassurance that they aren't a terrible person, some sufferers come across as if they want confirmation that they are bad and that what they did was egregious, terrible and worth punishment.
This theme can result in cognitive distortions being exhibited, including all-or-nothing-thinking. """"I did X, therefore I am evil.""""
Like any other theme, this theme can be dealt with using the tenets of CBT. From the cognitive side the person can start saying positive statements as opposed to negative, all-or-nothing-thinking statements. (I am a good person. I make mistakes but I am still a good person).
On the behavioral side, it is important that sufferers identify the compulsions they perform and work to resist them. No doubt ruminating is a big one with this theme. Refusal to confess past transgressions is essential, as is stopping searching on the Internet for similar stories.","['quality', 'Intrusive thoughts', 'fall', 'behavior', 'guilt', 'obsession', 'compulsion', 'interest', 'OCD', 'Thought']",1,1,1,1,1,1
"Hey there,
first of all sorry for my English. I´m from Germany and hope that everybody can understand...
Well I´m 23 years old and after my last relationship (three years ago) everything started...my last boyfried was a lier and didn´t treat me very well and at the end I realized that he just lied to me all the time...yes and that was the point where I lost my confidence in other people and at least my confidence in me.
I have sworn that I´m never gonna hurt somebody that way and that I never let somebody that close to me that he is able to hurt me in that way again.
Very soon after that break up I got into a new relationship and put all the problems and the distrust into it...
And very soon my first two OCDs started - first of all I had to question my boyfriend everything. I actually thought that I´m able to get the confidence on a rational way and asked him if he really loves me (just an example), and had to demand it over and over again...I always have to muse over and over about such irrelevant things and then I think I found an aspect so that I´m totally """"sure"""" that my boyfriend lied to me and then there´s such a strain that I actually """"need"""" to ask him again...
The other thing is that I started getting sexual obsessions because I was afraid to cheat on him and thought """"If you have any sexual thoughts with another man, it´s clear that you are a cheater"""". And so there was the compulsion NOT to think anything and so all came up...after a few month I told my boyfriend what debites me and that I don´t want all this etc. And he was very friendly and told me that I don´t need to worry and everything is okay as long as I don´t want it.
And at that point I guess the compulsion searched for another topic that it´s as bad as the topic before and I guess he found one which is even worse - children!
I am studying pedagocy and really love kids, I´ve always worked with them and it was my dream job! But then POCDS started - it´s so terrible! These thoughts I don´t want to have and then (often when I just see kids,, without thinking anything) there is this feeling down there, just like an physical arousal but I´m never sure if it´s really one. I hate that feeling and the thoughts and that I have das disorder and I´m so sad that I can´t be that opened and free in the near of the kids! But there is this feeling. I know that I´m very uncalm and full of anxiety but I still don´t know what this feeling is
Can anybody explain me the difference beetween real arousal and """"groinal response"""" (I´ve often read about this but - as I said - I´m German and don´t really find a good translation)?
Since a few weeks or even month I´m in a therapy but don´t have the feeling that it got better yet.
Does anybody have any tipps for me?

The mind poisons the heart if the mind is the master and the heart is the slave... to reverse this dissonace is the key to defeating OCD. Its all about acceptance of yourself and your emotions/heart/inner intuiton..... beacase i bet you ANYTHING... your deep intuition does NOT agree with ocd delusions....Its it because you are giving all the power to your mind.. and not to your nature... The problem lies here... we are tooooo neurotic and in the HEAD that weve lost our bodys intelligence... each time we feed this demon.. it eats at us. Step 1 is to do a cartharis... HEAVY chaotic breating.. through the nose.. in. out.. in. out.. forcefully.... second... you must breathe DEEP into the belly... the reason that weve become so detached from our true.. happy.. nature.. it because weve been disconnected from the sensitivity of the body.. and the intelligence of ones heart. Let out all youve been holding in, and do not JUDGE it... let your emotions go... do this in a space where its just you alone.... cause thigns could get a little intense.... this will help bring you back into the body..and soul.

"Hi, 
Hope everyone is doing okay! Haven’t posted on here in a while, and to be honest, I’m not really bothered if anyone replies to this or not. I just feel like I’ve been internalising all my emotions recently and I really, really need to let them all out. 
I know in my other posts I’ve said that I have suspected that I have OCD, but I’ve never been formally diagnosed, as my parents are reluctant to take me to get formally diagnosed, as they blame it on me being “hormonal” (I’m only 16 so I don’t think I can go to a professional without parental permission??). But lately, I’m not even sure if it’s OCD anymore. Since about May I’ve been terrified of committing suicide. However, at first it focused mainly on actually doing so, whereas now I feel like I’m just obsessed with my mental health. I feel like what I’m now scared of having depression, or even just being sad, but I feel like I’ve almost convinced myself that I could have depression, and that I’m miserable all the time. Therefore, I’m constantly trying to prove to myself that I’m happy, or I’m trying to improve my mental health. I keep trying stuff like attempting to fix my sleeping schedule, or meditating, etc, in an attempt to make myself happy, but I always fail, and give up-I think because I have convinced myself that I am miserable. 
However, I go through periods of about several days - a week of being miserable, and having no motivation, and not really wanting to do anything. During these periods, anything I see I will think of as sad, if that makes sense. I also occasionally typing that I might want to die when this happens, but I’m not sure if that’s the intrusive thoughts. Then, I suddenly have like, a few hours or maybe a day where I’m so motivated and I’m ridiculously happy, and I think that life is amazing. Everything I see I’ll think is amazing. Maybe that’s just normal teenage mood swings but I’m not really sure😂. 
Also, I still constantly touch wood superstitiously. Except, before it was mainly to do with either being sick, or suicide. Now, it still focuses mainly on those, but literally anything bad that I hear I’ll go “I hope that doesn’t happen to me, touch wood”. Like the other day, I was reading, and in the book the main character had cancer, so I was touching wood over and over again, hoping it didn’t happen to me. And then, sometimes I do it for no particular reason. There’s a wooden shelf above my bed, so sometimes when I’m lying in bed I just repetitively touch the shelf, for no reason whatsoever. 
Anyway, as for now I’m going to try to do a small amount of exercise every other day (and try and build up the amount I do) , and potentially attempt meditating again. I think that by not suddenly deciding to eat healthily, and do loads of exercise, and keep a journal, etc, I might actually stick to this resolution!
As I said earlier, I’m not expecting anyone to reply to this, but I feel a lot better for letting it all out. I’m also not sure if any of it made any sense, so sorry to whoever’s reading this!
Thank you so much, and I hope you’re well and safe.","['Intrusive thoughts', 'Thought', 'OCD', 'depression', 'hope']",0,1,0,1,0,1
"These are probably the three areas that I struggle with most in terms of OCD obsessions and compulsions. Dirt, Germs and Responsibility and mentally obsess over them, which has led to many compulsive behaviours such as constant checking, repetitive hand-washing, and reassurance-seeking from family, friends, and Google. Google is now a toxic ex-boyfriend to me, we no longer speak but he still tries to worm his way in.
I’m terrible at dirt being near or on me, which I’ve been exposed to everyday since March when I pick up Dave’s poops and when I shovel the pee out of his litter tray. EXPOSURE STRIKE 1 OCD YA LIL BISH.
I’m terrified of germs because they could make me or my loved ones sick. Dave happens to be a very sickly hamster. He has always had issues with his respiratory system and so gets ill and needs antibiotics and pain meds etc. Nursing a hamster with gooey eyes and germy snot has accidentally worked wonders for the OCD.

(STRIKE 2 imagine Dave drop-kicking the OCD cus that’s what’s bloody happening here.)
And then there’s the guilt. Ohhhh the guilt. I’ve mentioned in previous posts that OCD has caused me to feel disproportionate levels of responsibility when it comes to the wellbeing of humans and animals that I care about.

"I suffered a concussion two months ago and it has caused a resurfacing of my OCD. I've had some success in the past dealing with OCD and have a pretty good understanding of how to combat it using CBT techniques.
However, some new obsessions have arisen as a result of the head injury that lead me to perform mental checking rituals.
In the past, most of my compulsive behaviours have been physical or at least active. In other words, if there was a mental component it usually involved me actively doing something intentionally. My new obsession relates to worries about banging my head. Although I'm attempting to avoid doing any physical or intentional rituals, I find myself engaging in mental checking almost passively or automatically. For example: I might try to remember how close my head was to the wall or how hard I touched my head with my hand. I'm attempting to avoid doing this on purpose but I find the mental checking happening without intention.
I was wondering if anybody had any thoughts or advice on how to deal with this kind of checking. My intuition is to not worry when those thoughts come but to simply disengage with them.

"Hi everybody,
I'm a 25 year old dude. Anxious as can be, a workaholic, a virgin with little self-confidence and live at home with his family who have little respect for boundaries and personal space. I see a therapist on the regular but fear I'm reaching my breaking point. This is my story, I'm hoping somebody who reads this can offer some words of advice or some way helping. I live a hectic life and have gastrointestinal issues that can lead to slews of effects including psychological ones. I've struggled with depression most of my life and have been diagnosed with ADHD but showed signs as a kid. I felt I was missing out on things. Seeing friends with relationships and relationships and being happy, I felt broken. I had tried dating several women but due to anxiety and just social incompetence, things never worked. Fast-forward to university, I wind up seeing this woman three times and screw around. She had a boyfriend at the time and was rather unhappy with the situation. I stopped seeing her because I felt morally conflicted due to the situation. I went with the flow because it was a """"take what you can get"""" mentality. At the time, I was rather involved with student groups at my university. One guy I worked with was gay and rather flamboyant about it. He picked up on my insecurity and would to a degree bully me about, going """"why are you such an insecure virgin?"""" or constantly talk about how he would love to gawk at men wearing sweatpants, knowing it would bother me. 
Two years later, a massive strike of bad luck hits and there are some major life changing events: my dog (which was a source for much comfort) died due to an aneurysm, then so do my remaining grandparents. The grandparents died in isolated incidents due to natural causes but both in their own traumatic way. In the midst of all this, I met this fellow student. She was attractive, had the same sense of humour and we hit it off. Given all the stuff in the background, I didn't have the courage nor realized she was interested. By time the time I did, she was back with her ex and in an unhappy, dysfunctional relationship. They had been on/off for about 5 years at this point.
Around this time, I had my first full fledged anxiety attack while driving. I thought I was going to die: I was lightheaded, dizzy and my extremities felt numb. Was driving on the highway, this ruined driving for me to some degree and hasn't been the same since. I've loved cars and the idea of driving since I was a little kid.
The same thing happened again, I was the other guy in a relationship. I told her that screwing around was okay but no sex because I couldn't live with the moral implications. This was on/off for about a year. I got sick of it and told her if we wanted to go further, that she should break up. She agreed to give it some thought, I was so certain she was going to do it...and she didn't.  At a point in my life where I was extremely emotionally vulnerable, it shattered me. I started to question things along the lines of """"Why can't I get a relationship, I'm 23. What is wrong with me? Am I broken?"""" and then in my mind, I questioned my sexuality and if I was gay. My mind seemingly locked onto the question, despite it being farfetched. I can't say I questioned my sexuality from the first time I jerked off up to that moment. My mind went berserk and fully obsessive. I felt even more so broken, hazy. My mind was locked onto the concept of being gay but internally, it didn't resonate or feel right. I went into a panic for about a week. Fortunately, it was spring break so I spent the week in bed, staring at ceiling, feeling lost, silently crying and lacking control of a runaway mind. My brain pretty much went on autocomplete about being gay. Something completely irrelevant would have something gay attached to it. Intrusive thoughts started coming up and I started having mental compulsions that are commonly associated from what I've looked up on the internet. Still happens to this day but it waxes and wanes, some days are good and others not so much. I can't say I find men sexually arousing. I can appreciate that a man is good looking but in my mind, it tags such a thought as gay unconsciously, without any control. I tend to masturbate a lot, out of boredom and as stress relief. Given my wandering mind and ADHD, if the name of a man pops into my head for not even a second, I lose all arousal and just feeds back. I know I should kick the habit though. Additionally, in the influx of all the LGBT media in the spotlight lately, it adds more doubt because many articles pop up along the lines of """"I'm happy because of (lifestyle change)"""" so my mind processes it as a """"if this, then..."""" situation despite the fact that the thought of it internally doesn't seem right. 
On top of it, my mind is very obsessive. I find this to be what I call a """"mode"""" because my mind seems to engulf itself with these thoughts and they morph. One """"mode"""" of obsession is losing my job, another is hitting somebody with a car. All of which have had some situation that spurred the thought and it spiralled out and consumed my mind. That being said, this week at work, an incident caused a spike and my mind has been running through several of these modes. I've had anxiety attacks for the past four days, an immense difficulty getting out of bed and felt like crying to sleep out of frustration. I've taken two days off work which is a huge turn from my usual ~50-60 hour work week. Despite seeing a therapist for a year and a half, that's been stewing internally for two or more years. My therapy sessions tend to veer more on the side of my family and work issues but my therapist has suggested a consultation with the resident psychiatrist. Writing this rant has relaxed me somewhat though, along with the comfort that my current dog brings me. So I ask this, am I going crazy? It sure feels like it.

And I can't tell my friend to leave because thats just rude, and plus the OCD is winning more then.
I just don't know what to do. I'm sat upstairs, with my friend downstairs, and freaking out.
It was only the other day that I was thinking so positively.. And now this. Grr.

"You'd think if the stats are true and 1 in 50 people have OCD, that in every region of our country there would be numerous groups offering support. Why is it in the whole of Dorset I can only find a single group of only a few people who regularly meet? And whilst this one group is great, no-one actually talks about their obsessions in any specific way. Therefore I don't talk about mine either. Isn't the whole point of a support group to be really open about it? Anyone know of a group in Dorset, Bournemouth side?","['OCD', 'obsession']",0,1,0,1,0,0
"I'm annoyed with myself because: on Friday it was my birthday, and I had a really good night with my family. This carried on through Saturday, until last night I was reading the Four Steps by Dr Jeffrey Schwartz and decided to apply them then and there (I get rapid fire intrusive thoughts and subsequent compulsions that I'm constantly fighting). This resulted in a lot of 'unsolved problems' in my head, and I went to sleep anxious.
I'm now lay in bed, too tired to do anything but too agitated to relax, and I'm gutted I didn't just ride the wave of positivity until it ran out. I understand there's no perfect time to start fighting back, and the whole point of ERP is to expose yourself to anxiety, but I could have done with a couple days of feeling alright. I lose focus when I'm anxious, and find it difficult to apply the techniques I learned in CBT, so I feel like this whole exercise was for nothing.
I know this feeling is pretty common, but I just needed to rant and occupy my mind a little. Thanks for reading.","['Intrusive thoughts', 'Thought', 'compulsion', 'anxiety', 'anxiety']",1,1,1,1,1,1
"I have been suffering from OCD about my sexuality for the last year. It has been a tough year and I didn't want to treat it as OCD because I was afraid that I was repressing a part of me. Last week I decided I can't go on like this. Something needed to change. I refocused and redefined my obsessions as OCD. This is what they are. I may be a little bi but the way my mind treats it is definitely OCD. I know it is unrealistic and I know I can treat the way of thinking to be better. 
I won't lie the last week has been tough but after 5 days I have made a lot of progress. My find is focused on these worries all my waking hours but now I am on the way to developing a certainty I my mind. I am straight. I have a girlfriend. I have OCD. Relabeling these constant thoughts has given me clarity. I am not hiding anything from the world. I am not living a lie. I am a man who is on the way back to leading a happy and healthy life.
I have a long way to go but I can feel my mind turning. I have been meditating aswell which I have found very useful. When meditating I face situations that I fear. Doing this with a clear mind allows to me to access my true feelings. It gives me strength. With this and the help of people on board I hope my journey continues on this path.","['obsession', 'Thought', 'fear', 'hope', 'OCD']",0,1,0,1,0,1
"Hi -
So I haven't been on here since December since I was recovering. I've been on prozac since I was 18 (now 24) for depression but I was diagnosed with OCD in January. My psych bumped me up to a higher dosage of prozac - 80mg - which was doing a great job. But I wanted to go off of it because it was making me gain weight and now I'm freaking out!! My OCD revolves around cheating like some of you know...and my most recent """"obsession"""" (I put quotes around it cuz i question whether its an obsession or if its real) is that... well let me start from the beginning. I went to my fiancé's friends place and we all had a few drinks and played card games and such. I was with my fiance the whole time except for when I went to the bathroom. I remember everything from the night despite the alcohol in my system. We came home and continued drinking (just me and my fiance) and I eventually blacked out. I ended up having a dream about cheating on my partner with someone that I had seen earlier that night (well not really cheating just taking the guys hands and placing them in an odd place). But it's just that image in my head nothing else. I don't really remember waking up from it to realize it was a dream, I think I stirred but then went right back to sleep (i dont even remember)...I keep thinking what if it wasn't a dream what if it actually happened? My fiance keeps telling me he was with me the whole time and nothing happened but I think about the dream/image all day and it's driving me nuts! I always question whether I really have OCD or not and if the doc just diagnosed me to make me feel better and everything is true and real??? I have an appt with my psych tomorrow and I think I am going to have him write me a script for Zoloft...apparently it is an SSRI that doesn't cause weight gain. SSRI's are the only thing that seem to help me to accept uncertainty, but the thing that bothers me is I've never been able to say yes or no to the thoughts...but when I'm on the medication I'm kind of just like eh whatever and then the thought goes away. When I'm not I have crying spells and can't concentrate and just obsess and cry all day in the bathroom at work and also I get really bad separation anxiety from my fiance. Anyway I'm kind of just rambling just wanted to vent.

"Hi, 
First, I hope everyone managed to have some joy and happiness this Christmas, especially those who are struggling a lot at the moment. 
Second, this post is going to be weird so I apologise.
Today I realised something very important. I realised that I actually am a bad person. When I look around I see normal and kind people; when I look at myself I see something disguting and weird (but not in a good way). This sounds silly but I received lots of presents today (I've never received so many before) and I felt so guilty. I don't deserve good things or people in my life. 
Besides the fears of being attracted to children and being an abuser, I realised that I have so many other small obsessions. And they are absolutely disgusting. Take today for example. While having a nap with my boyfriend I had the feeling that I raped him by touching him in a weird way (by accident) and not doing anything about it for 30 seconds or so. While playing with my boyfriend's sister's cats I felt some sort of sick joy; I don't know if that was because I thought they were cute or because of something else. And these are only two examples, but there are so, so, so many other things that make me feel like a deviant and monster. My brain and body are so repugnant because they are the house of some of the most abnormal thoughts and feelings about the most normal things in the world, which automatically makes me a monster. And things would probably be easier if I were sure I didn't like all these feelings and thoughts, but here is the thing: I'm not sure. On the contrary, I think I do like and enjoy them, and I'm just too scared to accept it hence pretend to be scared, anxious and worried about it.
I think there is something seriously wrong with me. I'm a terrible person and I can feel it - I know this sounds weird but I can actually feel it. And because of that I don't want to be alive anymore, I really don't. For some reason I know I won't be able to survive like this for more than 10 (or even 5) years. I will never be happy with myslef; I'm way too rotten and evil inside for that to happen. 
Again, I apologise. I know this is not the post you would like to see during this festive period.","['hope', 'happiness', 'guilt', 'fear', 'obsession', 'disgust', 'joy', 'Thought']",0,1,0,1,0,1
"Hello everyone. I could really use your help right now in identifying whether this is another OCD obsession or just my mind being corrupt
I hav suffered before with OCD obsessions about harming my family and it was the worst experience of my life. I did get treatment in the form of CBT and this helped. However, after my A level exams (which were STRESSFULL) my OCD has returned and now I obsess over harm, inappropriately touching people etc.
Apart from this, a new obsession has come. Whenever I see any young child laughing or playing or just sitting (usually my 8 year old cousin who visits us) I start to have intrusive thought about negative experiences in my own childhood. My father was an alcoholic which left me with very panicky experiences. I get really distressed by thesehorrible reminders and I do cry.
As a result, I avoid playing with my cousin at all costs so don't have to dwell on my own childhood and feel depressed. However, just seeing my cousin once brings these horrible memories which are followed by on-going thoughts in my mind that tell me
'I'm hopeless due to my childhood', 'I will never amount to anything' and 'My childhood made me this way'.
Please help me. I need to know if this is another OCD obsession so I can find some peace of mind and know its not me being a bitter and twisted idiot.

The mind poisons the heart if the mind is the master and the heart is the slave... to reverse this dissonace is the key to defeating OCD. Its all about acceptance of yourself and your emotions/heart/inner intuiton..... beacase i bet you ANYTHING... your deep intuition does NOT agree with ocd delusions....Its it because you are giving all the power to your mind.. and not to your nature... The problem lies here... we are tooooo neurotic and in the HEAD that weve lost our bodys intelligence... each time we feed this demon.. it eats at us. Step 1 is to do a cartharis... HEAVY chaotic breating.. through the nose.. in. out.. in. out.. forcefully.... second... you must breathe DEEP into the belly... the reason that weve become so detached from our true.. happy.. nature.. it because weve been disconnected from the sensitivity of the body.. and the intelligence of ones heart.

"Hi, 
Hope everyone is doing okay! Haven’t posted on here in a while, and to be honest, I’m not really bothered if anyone replies to this or not. I just feel like I’ve been internalising all my emotions recently and I really, really need to let them all out. 
I know in my other posts I’ve said that I have suspected that I have OCD, but I’ve never been formally diagnosed, as my parents are reluctant to take me to get formally diagnosed, as they blame it on me being “hormonal” (I’m only 16 so I don’t think I can go to a professional without parental permission??). But lately, I’m not even sure if it’s OCD anymore. Since about May I’ve been terrified of committing suicide. However, at first it focused mainly on actually doing so, whereas now I feel like I’m just obsessed with my mental health. I feel like what I’m now scared of having depression, or even just being sad, but I feel like I’ve almost convinced myself that I could have depression, and that I’m miserable all the time. Therefore, I’m constantly trying to prove to myself that I’m happy, or I’m trying to improve my mental health. I keep trying stuff like attempting to fix my sleeping schedule, or meditating, etc, in an attempt to make myself happy, but I always fail, and give up-I think because I have convinced myself that I am miserable. 
However, I go through periods of about several days - a week of being miserable, and having no motivation, and not really wanting to do anything. During these periods, anything I see I will think of as sad, if that makes sense. I also occasionally typing that I might want to die when this happens, but I’m not sure if that’s the intrusive thoughts. Then, I suddenly have like, a few hours or maybe a day where I’m so motivated and I’m ridiculously happy, and I think that life is amazing. Everything I see I’ll think is amazing. Maybe that’s just normal teenage mood swings but I’m not really sure😂. 
Also, I still constantly touch wood superstitiously. Except, before it was mainly to do with either being sick, or suicide. Now, it still focuses mainly on those, but literally anything bad that I hear I’ll go “I hope that doesn’t happen to me, touch wood”. Like the other day, I was reading, and in the book the main character had cancer, so I was touching wood over and over again, hoping it didn’t happen to me. And then, sometimes I do it for no particular reason. There’s a wooden shelf above my bed, so sometimes when I’m lying in bed I just repetitively touch the shelf, for no reason whatsoever. 
Anyway, as for now I’m going to try to do a small amount of exercise every other day (and try and build up the amount I do) , and potentially attempt meditating again. I think that by not suddenly deciding to eat healthily, and do loads of exercise, and keep a journal, etc, I might actually stick to this resolution!
As I said earlier, I’m not expecting anyone to reply to this, but I feel a lot better for letting it all out. I’m also not sure if any of it made any sense, so sorry to whoever’s reading this!
Thank you so much, and I hope you’re well and safe.","['Intrusive thoughts', 'Thought', 'OCD', 'depression', 'hope']",0,1,0,1,0,1

"I suffered a concussion two months ago and it has caused a resurfacing of my OCD. I've had some success in the past dealing with OCD and have a pretty good understanding of how to combat it using CBT techniques.
However, some new obsessions have arisen as a result of the head injury that lead me to perform mental checking rituals.
In the past, most of my compulsive behaviours have been physical or at least active. In other words, if there was a mental component it usually involved me actively doing something intentionally. My new obsession relates to worries about banging my head. Although I'm attempting to avoid doing any physical or intentional rituals, I find myself engaging in mental checking almost passively or automatically. For example: I might try to remember how close my head was to the wall or how hard I touched my head with my hand. I'm attempting to avoid doing this on purpose but I find the mental checking happening without intention.
I was wondering if anybody had any thoughts or advice on how to deal with this kind of checking. My intuition is to not worry when those thoughts come but to simply disengage with them.

"Hi.
  I'm on ERP for OCD since 4 weeks.
My OCD was to repeat phrases / sounds / images simply that I heard of saw.
  My guiding principles now : no avoidance, agree with everything your OCD throws at you and don't debate any thought. Plus avoid any kind of reasurance.
  My ERP was very successful since yersteday. I was able again to enjoy things in my life, and I completely surrendered to my OCD and I (nearly) defeated everything it threw at me. 
Everytime I defeated an obsession, another came, and each time I used ERP.
  But OCD is so vicious, it will try to find every hole in your ERP to punch you in the face and put you back weeks ago in your therapy.
  Here's the thing. I prevent myself from any kind of reassurance : I know that by posting this topic I'm reassuring quite a lot, but the situation is alarming.
  I used to say myself things like """"Your OCD will be there forever"""". And with time, I feel like I accepted it.
  However because OCD is really sadistic and vicious, my brain is now making reassuring statements like """"No it will get out of your head, don't panic everything's gonna be fine"""" and because I CAN'T DO AVOIDANCE of my thought (because my initial obsession is to repeat thought / words / phrases / images remember, so I can't avoid these thoughts.
  And when I try not to avoid them, each time I'm """"agreeing"""" with my OCD """"You're screwing everything up and you will stay with this anxiety for your life"""" immediatly a reassuring statement is created by my brain and because I can't avoid it a fight begins between the two opposite statements.
  Results : my therapy is going down and I feel like my OCD is taking back it's power on me because I can't avoid the reassuring statements.
  This contradiction is so terrible and I don't know what to do.
  2 options :
  LET THEM IN even though it will reinforce bigly all my OCD
PUSH THEM OUT but reinforce them by avoiding them 
  It's so annoying, please understand and answer me quick

"Hi, I am a 17 year old boy. For about a year now, I have had intrusive thoughts which I find very difficult to control. I obsess about whether i'm a pedophile, whether I am sexually attracted to children. I have a girlfriend, we have been going out for almost 8 months. I am very sexually attracted to her and we have a great sex life.
Recently though these thoughts have become worse, and when I see young girls I usually question myself about whether I'm attracted to them or not. Then on the few occasions that I can control the thoughts and convince myself I just have a disorder, I then start to obsess about whether all pedophiles start off feeling like how I feel. I find myself noticing that I've looked at a young girl and questioning whether I choose to do it or not. I have also noticed that these thoughts are more frequent when I have allot of time to myself, or at night when i'm trying to get to sleep.
All this makes me extremely distressed, I can't tell my girlfriend because I'm worried what she'll think. She could leave me in disgust. I am generally a anxious person, and my friends and family say I over think things allot. I have stopped smoking weed because I found my thoughts are even more uncontrollable. When I'm stoned my obsessions are only deeper and more consuming. I occasionally have intrusive thoughts about jumping off a cliff, or cutting myself or sexual thoughts about family but I can usually brush past these, dismissing these as stupid. These things to me don't seem quite as horrible as being attracted to young children.
I understand that in order for these thoughts to go away I have to react to them calmly and accept them, but I find this very hard. I find it hard to accept these thoughts because I worry about the effects this might have. If I'm having these thoughts and accepting them, then what is the difference between me and a pedophile.
What I need to know is
are there any good techniques for controlling my mind better, making myself act calmly?
do I need therapy to sort this out
If so, considering I live in the UK is this therapy free and will my parents have to know about it?
I'd really appreciate any help/advice anyone can give me. This is really ruining my life at the moment. I find it hard to sleep sometimes if I can't shut these thoughts out.","['disgust', 'obsession', 'Thought', 'Intrusive thoughts']",0,1,0,1,0,1
"Hello to all from a newbie, don't often post on internet forums so forgive me if the following diatribe is a bit rambling or long winded....
Where to begin? Well suppose I should start by saying that it's only really been in the last couple of years or so that I've consciously realised that I suffer from some form of OCD. Probably doesn't sound like a huge deal until you put it into context that I've had this condition since I was about ten years old, and I recently turned the ripe old age of 27. Like many others, I always associated OCD with compulsive neatness and an intense phobia of germs, whereas what afflicts me is something altogether more random, or at least I had always thought so until stumbling across this site. Absolutely no idea how it started, had a relatively happy childhood bar a few borderline evil primary school teachers/""""friends"""", so I guess it's probably down to a chemical imbalance unless there's something disturbing that I've managed to shut away within the recesses of my memory.
When I was a kid I began getting into the habit of not being able to go to bed without touching certain objects a specified number of times. This escalated into a sort of OCD numbers obsession whereas I'd start dividing numbers into """"good"""" and """"bad"""" categories, no rhyme or reason to it, just whatever bizarre logic my mind would attach to them. So far, so probably a bit weird, but things started getting even worse as I progressed into my teens (oh what fun those years were).
Once a teenager, the same behaviour continued, only I started using films instead of numbers when applying positive/negative assertions, again no idea why, but I've always been a huge film fan so that's probably the reason for it. I'd (and still continue to) not be able to let go of objects like a light switch until I had said film in my head, only then could I release it. If I released it whilst thinking of a """"bad"""" film, for instance a horror or a disaster movie, I'd have to repeat the process. On top of that, if the successful time coincided with an odd number (i.e. it was the third or fifth attempt), I'd have to try again so that it would match an even number.
At this point I have to ask, am I sounding like a complete psycho, or has/does anyone else experience(d) this? I should also point out that I have never told a soul about any of this (this is in fact the first time I have ever written it down), other than infrequently quipping in passing to friends that I think I'm borderline OCD, like it's a common cold or something, and doesn't affect my life at all.
The problem is, is that it does. To the stage were there is barely a day that goes by without featuring some completely irrational anxious thought. I have a constant fear of death, something that was unfortunately exacerbated by the sudden death of my mum a few years ago. I now live in constant fear that I will die at any moment, even in the most mundane situation like sitting at my desk in work. I have an out and out phobia of flying, which I never used to have at all, and always think that I'll die every time I board a plane (something I have to do in a week's time, yay). I worry even more about my family/friends, if I text someone (especially my dad, which will be down to the fact he is my only living parent) and don't hear back from them within 5 minutes I'll immediately assume that they've been killed and spend the next however many minutes having a panic attack until I hear from them telling me they've just nipped to the shops or haven't had a phone signal.
The other more recent, and far more disturbing affliction that sits alongside the paranoid fears are the completely random, horrible thoughts that occasionally pop unannounced into my mind, like """"you will kill someone one day"""" or similar sick accusations that of course have no actual chance of ever occurring, as I like to constantly remind my brain. I think it's like my mind sometimes likes to think of the most horrifying things that people can do and tell me that I'm capable of those too, even though it's all lies. But even though I know it's irrational, the fact that those thoughts have arisen in the first place worries me that they could be right. A few reads through the other topics of this board tells me that I am not alone, and I burst into tears as soon as I realised that this bizarre and horrible condition isn't isolated to me after all, having spent the best part of 17 years thinking that it was.
I suppose the way forward is to go and see my GP as soon as, even though I'm terrified of repeating any of this out loud to a person. I did undergo counselling a few years ago and took citalopram as had particularly nasty bouts of depression following my mum's death, but I never mentioned OCD symptoms at all to my doctor/counsellor. At that point I think I was still assuming that my condition was entirely singular to me and wouldn't even be medically recognised. My only regret is that it took me so long to actually do a bit of research, this site has been incredibly helpful and a huge comfort.
So that's about it, whilst I can only be diagnosed as having some form of OCD by a medical professional, I would be really interested to know of anyone's thoughts of the above or of similar experiences. Finally well done to anyone who actually made it this far in this epic post, a salute has been thrown your way.","['obsession', 'depression', 'symptom', 'regret', 'interest', 'site', 'object', 'fear', 'Thought', 'OCD', 'process']",0,1,0,1,1,1
"Hi
Havent posted on here for a couple of weeks. I have my first appiontment with a therapist on Friday morning. This will be the start of my battle against my OCD which has been running a bit wild lately, due to a problem I had recently at work.
Its time for it to give me a well deserved rest now. My OCD also makes my jealousy worse, and if I see a nice girl in the street while I am out, I get a mad obsession, and for about a day or two after, I cant stop thinking about her, and obsessing whether she has a boyfriend or not, all this over complete strangers who I will never even see again. And sometimes I think I have said the wrong thing to someone in a conversation, and worry about blurting out nasty words which is the last thing I'd do. I need to fight away these thoughts now.
My GP reckons antidepressants. I think that would be a good idea, help lift my mood. I am worried about any side effects though.

"hi there, this is my first post.
I have suffered with intrusive thoughts for about 18 months now. The treatment i received from various health services was very poor and set me back a long way, to the extent i would be reluctant to seek help again. It does seem from reading other posts that the level of support and help varies greatly with location. Luckily, through a lot of research i have gained a good understanding of the condition and think i have made a lot of progress.
I suppose i have too main questions, the first being do you ever fully get over OCD ??
The second is that although i have managed to get the intrusive thoughts under control i still feel a lot of guilt and shame at the thoughts i had - does this mean i am still suffering from OCD ? I think the guilt and shame stem from what i believe would be people's reaction / perception to me if they found out about my condition. Does this mean i haven't really accepted them as just thoguhts.
For all suffers, for a time i was a low as i believe it is possible for a person to get, but with a lot of support from my family i am now getting back to something like the person i used to be. There is hope no matter how bad things seem.
Thanks for reading.","['Treatment', 'hope', 'OCD', 'guilt', 'shame', 'Thought', 'Intrusive thoughts']",0,1,0,1,0,1
"My daughter has had 6 sessions of therapy but It seems like she's getting worse as she has more bad days than good. I'm very confused.? Her session last week her therapist did work with helping her to go to a party on Saturday. Plus my daughter got two intrusive thoughts out. She went to the party first time of seeing her friends in 5 months and she had a great time. First time I've seen her smile and look happy. Then today she's been sad with bad thoughts again !!

I have this one word like.it's on repeat in my head. I have intrusive thoughts around harming and also I have a fear I will develop schizophrenia. When the one word gets stuck in my head..I fear I am going.to loose control. This has been going.on now for 2 years. I was diagnosed with old over 6 years ago and it was intense for 7 months but faded away until I gave birth again 2 years ago. I just can't seem to let this go. I get visions of myself locked in a cell and I've gone crazy. Im not sure what compulsions I perform now because I used to do loads but cut them all like googling and asking for reassurance now after this word going.over and over I'm posting here but I don't know of that's a compulsion but part of me feels if someone responds then I will feel better so I suppose it is a compulsion?!

"Hi everyone
I wanted to discuss and needed some advice on two aspects, first is of depersonalization(some of you may have not heard of this sympton),however does anyone here have this sympton with their ocd? ocd anxiety and depersonalisation are all closely linked right? ive not heard of anyone who experiences ocd and depersonalisation like mine so im feeling quite alone my compulsions mainly consists of mental rituals however as a child they were more physical. depersonalisation was what i was diagnosed with experiencing 5 years back by my psychiatrist however he insisted it was purely anxiety based. however i advised him of my physical rituals as a child and he still put it all down to """"anxiety disorder"""" so i just left it as that and then a few years later i started experiencing mental compulsions ie: confessing sins and incest thoughts etc and my counsellor again just put it down to """"severe anxiety"""" i explained to her again of my rituals as a child nevertherless she told me my mental symptons were anxiety symptons and not ocd!. To this day im left contemplating whether i have pure o (which i surre i do because everyday im battling intrusive thoughts of incest, sin confessing and the many more)or just """"severe anxiety"""" . What would you guys reckkhon? My depersonalisation is still very existent and so are my intrusive thoughts so are my symptons anxiety disorder based or ocd based? or maybe both mixed?
The second thing i needed to discuss was about the term """"mental ruminations"""" is this just another way of describing when an ocd sufferer's mind is constantly fishing for that """"new"""" intrusve thought? I feel like this all the time, especially every morning when i awake to find that i can feel my mind literally searching for something to obsess about which is soo annoying cause somethings im sitting there thinking"""" omgg just think of something to obsess about already so i can use my cbt techniques and have u ****** and destroyed u stupid thought"""" (sorry about my language)its at these points that my mind never actually finds anything to obsess about but yet the whole constant thinking and constant """"ruminations"""" of dinding that blasted thought are always apparent. Is this what the term mental ruminations mean? I dont fear these compulsions anymore so why do i still feel this way? Its almost as if when are minds are free from obsessions they are still obsessing to find something to obsess over right? Hmmmm neways please anyone reply to my post im in such an anxious state at the moment so need to go and keep myself busy i guess xxx","['fear', 'obsession', 'Rituals', 'OCD', 'anxiety', 'anxiety', 'Anxiety disorder', 'Intrusive thoughts', 'compulsion', 'Thought']",1,1,1,1,1,1

"It is my 1st therapy session of CBT today for OCD/anxiety. I have a tense stomach and keep for getting to breath calmly. The other thing is clenching my jaw, I've been really good at stopping that but feel like slowly slipping back to old ways. Although this is my 1st CBT I was diagnosed with OCD and anxiety when I was under immense stress at work and went for counselling for the stress, it was only because one session I happened to be having an anxiety attack that the therapist could start to help me with what I have been suffering all my life but to afraid to make it official and get help, I thought I was coping.
I am so worried about today now it all feels real and I know I have to explain everything and all aspects for CBT to work but it is going to require a lot of strength on my part. I know I will have to face the compulsions but I have done them all my life I feel like its so woven in me that I won't be anything with out it. I check, organise, plan, wash hands, check doors, worry about everything, have intrusive thoughts, play out future events in my head its all normal to me to do that. Who will I be without it? It effects what I like, what I do , how i behave (i have to be good/kind/lawful/perfect do things the right way to the rules).
Just need to know people are out there who understand this.","['compulsion', 'Intrusive thoughts', 'OCD', 'anxiety', 'anxiety', 'Thought']",1,1,1,1,1,1
"Hello,
I've had OCD for as long as I can remember (currently 25). Throughout my life my obsessions have changed from one thing to the next. It started with Intrusive violent/sexual thoughts when I was in grade school, then being completely obsessed with my significant other's past relationships/partners up until 2 years ago. I had a brief period of freedom from almost any type of noticeable obsessions/compulsions.
This is when my daughter was born. For the first 3 months after her birth things finally seemed to be working out but it seems like out of nowhere I began having issues with germs and contamination. Since then things have steadily become more and more severe. These issues are the worst I've ever experienced.
Basically anything and everything I touch feels like it will spread germs/Bodily Fluids and excrement to me, my belongings, and my family members.
My fears of bodily fluids, germs, and feces specifically have brought me to a point where I can no longer function, let alone work or care for my family. My wife and parents do nearly everything because I am unable.
My bathroom and shower rituals are literally destroying my body. Without going into too much detail every time i use the restroom is a physically painful experience, i must shower after every use of the restroom, I wash my hands to the point where I can't bend my fingers, I frequently(5+ times a day) use chemicals such as lysol spray and clorox wipes on my skin, hands, legs, butt, feet, and arms even right after I have showered, and worst of all is my shower ritual.
No matter how hard I try or what I do I cannot seem to shower in under 2 hours time. Literally every centimeter of my skin has to be washed/scrubbed until it feels """"clean"""" to me. I cannot cross-contaminate body parts and so use 3-5 different wash cloths. I also have to wash my hands after nearly everything i touch or wash. Worst of all is washing anything below my waist. This causes severe panic and sometimes upwards of 30 minutes just washing my hands after washing these areas.
By the time my shower is finished my skin is raw and extremely painful and then chemicals are used on top of that to """"make sure"""" I'm completely clean. I finally slide to my room on a towel to get dressed making sure I don't touch the floor. I get dressed after ensuring my hands and all my clean clothes are actually clean.
The rest of my day is spent cleaning any surface I sit on with chemicals and avoiding touching nearly everything.
I've been on different doses of zoloft most of my life, I've done some CBT/exposure therapy that doesn't seem to help much, and I've been taking Anafranil at 100mg. Nothing seems to be working and I fear for my health and my family. I want to be here for my wife and daughter, I fully realize that most of this is completely irrational, but i cant find any help and can't seem to escape this.
ANY advice, suggestions, help is extremely appreciated!!!

"Reading the book Stop Obsessing!: How to Overcome Your Obsessions and Compulsion, authors talked about a place, where is possible to develop a 21 day program to overcome the OCD
Thing is that, for some months I've been trying to do the program by myself, but I have found this is like studying: You can buy the books and study by yourself at home, or you can go to class and get a help boost to perform better during the study (despite you may have some homework to reinforce)
This is why I've decided to take a step foward and try to find a place to do this 21-day program (a place where this is done regularly). I don't want to treat with a professional that is sitting in """"his office"""" and talks behind a table about the problem. I wants something """"hands-on"""" just from the beginning! I've been going in multiple therapies for more than 10 years and they have been a total failure. Since I started the self-help program I've progressed like 10 times more than in all the 10 years with """"""""""""""""professional guidance""""""""""""""""
If anyone can help me out where to find some of what I'm looking for, I will really appreciate it. I'm from Spain, and I might consider going to England for 21 days if its needed (if you know somewhere in Spain where I can find this will be much better by the way)","['obsession', 'compulsion', 'OCD', 'office']",1,1,0,0,0,0
