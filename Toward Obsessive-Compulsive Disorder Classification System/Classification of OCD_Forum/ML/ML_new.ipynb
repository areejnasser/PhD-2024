I've been on prozac since I was 18 (now 24) for depression but I was diagnosed with OCD in January. My psych bumped me up to a higher dosage of prozac - 80mg - which was doing a great job. But I wanted to go off of it because it was making me gain weight and now I'm freaking out!! My OCD revolves around cheating like some of you know...and my most recent \"\"\"\"obsession\"\"\"\" (I put quotes around it cuz i question whether its an obsession or if its real) is that... well let me start from the beginning. I went to my fiancé's friends place and we all had a few drinks and played card games and such. I was with my fiance the whole time except for when I went to the bathroom. I remember everything from the night despite the alcohol in my system. We came home and continued drinking (just me and my fiance) and I eventually blacked out. I ended up having a dream about cheating on my partner with someone that I had seen earlier that night (well not really cheating just taking the guys hands and placing them in an odd place). But it's just that image in my head nothing else. I don't really remember waking up from it to realize it was a dream, I think I stirred but then went right back to sleep (i dont even remember)...I keep thinking what if it wasn't a dream what if it actually happened? My fiance keeps telling me he was with me the whole time and nothing happened but I think about the dream/image all day and it's driving me nuts! I always question whether I really have OCD or not and if the doc just diagnosed me to make me feel better and everything is true and real??? I have an appt with my psych tomorrow and I think I am going to have him write me a script for Zoloft...apparently it is an SSRI that doesn't cause weight gain. SSRI's are the only thing that seem to help me to accept uncertainty, but the thing that bothers me is I've never been able to say yes or no to the thoughts...but when I'm on the medication I'm kind of just like eh whatever and then the thought goes away. When I'm not I have crying spells and can't concentrate and just obsess and cry all day in the bathroom at work and also I get really bad separation anxiety from my fiance. Anyway I'm kind of just rambling just wanted to vent. Hope everyone is doing okay.   \n",
              "1  Hi all, hope you're all having a wonderful bank holiday whatever it is you're doing😎 I however am taking an introverted approach and just chilling and if you're reading this I thank you for taking your time out to read my first post on this forum and giving it some notice. I've taken some time out to read others experiences relating to OCD and other mental illnesses, knowing that I am not alone and gaining more insight to a really important topic and by reading other people's stories, by doing this I find that I'm learning more about myself as well. Some made me laugh, some made me cry. But thankyou nonetheless. What a great, lovely bunch of people. \\nJust to add a little context, I'm a 21 year old male, recently come to terms with the fact I have OCD. As well as this I also have GAD, major depression and an eating disorder. \\nNot getting into too much detail about the discovery of my OCD. Although rather impactful, it in some way has helped me knowing that there is a reason I am the way I am. I'm aware to not use the term 'Pure O' as it's not a medically used term and it is exactly the same as the more commonly known OCD subtypes. My compulsions are mainly in the mind. The themes are around harm, pedophilia, relationships, sexuality, existential, incest, depression and unfortunately the list goes on with various different themes. I've been having these thoughts for what it seems almost all my life. I always thought there was something wrong with me. When I was around 15/16, when I got into a conversation with a friend about mental illnesses. I knew from then on what I had to do, I had to diagnose myself with whatever it is that is wrong with me and I had to then give myself CBT before I get thrown in a loony bin or reported to the police as a danger or even worse, before I could act on them thoughts. For 6 years, that has been my mission. I thought, my intrusive thoughts were a part of me just waiting to burst out at any random moment. I thought that someday I'm going to wake up, something would switch in my brain and I would either black out and forget what I had done or even more frighteningly, actually be completely aware and actually taking pleasure in said scenarios based around my intrusive thoughts. I thought I had a monster, living inside me, just waiting for its perfect time to attack. I wouldn't know it until I knew it.\\nI have lived (and still live) in complete fear that I am my thoughts and they are a tremendous flaw in my personality. I guess I'm still yet to convince myself that it is true but as you all know, you have your ups and downs with this ever so painful disorder. It has been difficult to me, as Im coming to terms with having OCD, I am currently piecing together all my symptoms and all the intrusive thoughts I've ever had throughout my life. It's like they've all come back at me and I'm in a bit of a pickle. But, I will be getting help very soon, just waiting to find a specialist in OCD and CBT in the Sheffield area and I will be making steps to make my life manageable again as I seemed to of gone off the rails after some family related issues and the breakdown of my relationship with my amazing ex girlfriend. And I am hopeful, even though I am actually scared. And admitting to being scared is something I've never done, even though scared is what I've been all my life. However, opening up to my loved ones about my thoughts, I have received nothing but love, support and compassion and honestly... That's what I was most scared of, their reaction to my thoughts, and in that moment I knew that I had lived in fear for too long. They're heartbroken I'm going through this and have been for a long time, but only because they see me for what I don't. A normal, human being. Just like everyone else on this forum, or reading the forum. You're all normal, at least to us. And take comfort in that as did I when I came across these posts. \\nThere's a lyric that I've always been attached to, by a band called Meshuggah (shout out to all metal heads on this forum) and I'd love to share it. \\n'The struggle to free myself from restraints, becomes my very shackles.' \\nI hope that whoever reads this post, whether youre someone who has been diagnosed with OCD for years or someone who is finding answers. Please know you're not alone in this. And it will and can get better because ultimately you deserve it and you ought to have the drive to go out there and do it. Because you are not your thoughts. You know what you are, just look a little deeper, and you'll see you for the beautiful person you are, because all you're doing and all I'm doing, is our own disorderly way of protecting us from the things we fear the most. \\nHave a good one guys. Enjoy the glorious weather. Thankyou so much.   \n",

I realised that I actually am a bad person. When I look around I see normal and kind people; when I look at myself I see something disguting and weird (but not in a good way). This sounds silly but I received lots of presents today (I've never received so many before) and I felt so guilty. I don't deserve good things or people in my life. \\nBesides the fears of being attracted to children and being an abuser, I realised that I have so many other small obsessions. And they are absolutely disgusting. Take today for example. While having a nap with my boyfriend I had the feeling that I raped him by touching him in a weird way (by accident) and not doing anything about it for 30 seconds or so. While playing with my boyfriend's sister's cats I felt some sort of sick joy; I don't know if that was because I thought they were cute or because of something else. And these are only two examples, but there are so, so, so many other things that make me feel like a deviant and monster. My brain and body are so repugnant because they are the house of some of the most abnormal thoughts and feelings about the most normal things in the world, which automatically makes me a monster. And things would probably be easier if I were sure I didn't like all these feelings and thoughts, but here is the thing: I'm not sure. On the contrary, I think I do like and enjoy them, and I'm just too scared to accept it hence pretend to be scared, anxious and worried about it.\\nI think there is something seriously wrong with me. I'm a terrible person and I can feel it - I know this sounds weird but I can actually feel it. And because of that I don't want to be alive anymore, I really don't. For some reason I know I won't be able to survive like this for more than 10 (or even 5) years. I will never be happy with myslef; I'm way too rotten and evil inside for that to happen. \\nAgain, I apologise. I know this is not the post you would like to see during this festive period.   \n",

I could really use your help right now in identifying whether this is another OCD obsession or just my mind being corrupt\\nI hav suffered before with OCD obsessions about harming my family and it was the worst experience of my life. I did get treatment in the form of CBT and this helped. However, after my A level exams (which were STRESSFULL) my OCD has returned and now I obsess over harm, inappropriately touching people etc.\\nApart from this, a new obsession has come. Whenever I see any young child laughing or playing or just sitting (usually my 8 year old cousin who visits us) I start to have intrusive thought about negative experiences in my own childhood. My father was an alcoholic which left me with very panicky experiences. I get really distressed by thesehorrible reminders and I do cry.\\nAs a result, I avoid playing with my cousin at all costs so don't have to dwell on my own childhood and feel depressed. However, just seeing my cousin once brings these horrible memories which are followed by on-going thoughts in my mind that tell me\\n'I'm hopeless due to my childhood', 'I will never amount to anything' and 'My childhood made me this way'.\\nPlease help me. I need to know if this is another OCD obsession so I can find some peace of mind and know its not me being a bitter and twisted idiot.\\nSo is this OCD???   \n",
              "4                                                                       Though it comes in many flavors, one of the more common OCD themes we see on the forum is that of (no) crime and punishment. I wrote it that way for a reason. The sufferer believes they made an egregious mistake or have even committed a crime (what they did was so terrible), yet everyone else on the forum responds that no such crime exists or that the mistake is nothing to worry about. This theme has one thing in common: the sufferer's steadfast determination to punish themselves for the perceived transgression.\\nMany times someone will raise an issue like this on the forum, then vehemently stick to the belief that the situation has nothing to do with OCD. We see it so often here one would have to wonder how it could not be OCD, since the posts appear on an OCD forum. Further, people with this particular theme often have other, more easily identifiable versions of OCD, lending credence to the belief that the current problem is also OCD.\\nThe main reason why people balk at the thought that OCD is involved is that the situation (the crime) was real. OCD apparently didn't have any part in the formation of the crime/mistake. While that appears to be true in most cases of this theme, the person nonetheless is dealing with OCD now. Real mistakes or errors in judgment or perceived crimes can happen in real life. OCD comes into play when the person becomes overly focused on the mistake/crime/error to the detriment of their ability to live a quality life.\\nSometimes the 'crime' took place recently. In many cases it happened years and years ago but suddenly popped into the mind of the OCD sufferer. In all cases sufferers with this theme become obsessed with what happened. They fixate on the alleged crime and can't shake it from their mind. The thought of what happened (obsession) causes distress. And the sufferer performs compulsions, most notably ruminating -- going over the event in their mind repeatedly.\\nA notable manifestation of this theme is the very common belief that the crime/mistake/error made in the past is absolutely terrible. Sufferers commonly come across as being devastated that they made such a mistake, which they believe is life changing. Interestingly, the nearly unanimous verdict of responders to threads about this OCD theme is that the crime/mistake/error appears to be minor in origin and not worth worrying about.\\nOne by-product of this OCD theme and the way it manifests is what can be an overwhelming feeling of guilt. As everyone should know, OCD involves obsessions (intrusive thoughts) that cause distress. With this theme the majority of that distress is expressed as guilt. Consquently, sufferers with this theme commonly believe that they should be/must be punished for their transgression. This is expressed in self loathing comments and an interest shown in confessing the transgression to loved ones/the police.\\nOther people look at the situations and see they are minor incidents that should be dismissed, but the sufferers of this theme truly believe it is a case of crime and required punishment. Attempts at reassuring sufferers that they did not do bad, that they are not bad and that they deserve no punishment usually fall on deaf ears.\\nLike with other OCD themes, sufferers of this theme are their own worst enemies. Although the obsessions (thoughts that the sufferer did wrong) can be fleeting and last only seconds, sufferers can spend hours and hours ruminating on the subject. They can perform other compulsions, such as searching the Internet for stories of people who similarly screwed up, searching to find out what truly bad people do as a way of comparison, seeking reassurance and confessing.\\nInterestingly, with this OCD theme, the reassurance seeking can be the reverse of what is normally seen. While some people may ask for reassurance that they aren't a terrible person, some sufferers come across as if they want confirmation that they are bad and that what they did was egregious, terrible and worth punishment.\\nThis theme can result in cognitive distortions being exhibited, including all-or-nothing-thinking. \"\"\"\"I did X, therefore I am evil.\"\"\"\"\\nLike any other theme, this theme can be dealt with using the tenets of CBT. From the cognitive side the person can start saying positive statements as opposed to negative, all-or-nothing-thinking statements. (I am a good person. I make mistakes but I am still a good person).\\nOn the behavioral side, it is important that sufferers identify the compulsions they perform and work to resist them. No doubt ruminating is a big one with this theme. Refusal to confess past transgressions is essential, as is stopping searching on the Internet for similar stories.   \n",

              "      <td>Hi -\\nSo I haven't been on here since December since I was recovering. I've been on prozac since I was 18 (now 24) for depression but I was diagnosed with OCD in January. My psych bumped me up to a higher dosage of prozac - 80mg - which was doing a great job. But I wanted to go off of it because it was making me gain weight and now I'm freaking out!! My OCD revolves around cheating like some of you know...and my most recent \"\"\"\"obsession\"\"\"\" (I put quotes around it cuz i question whether its an obsession or if its real) is that... well let me start from the beginning. I went to my fiancé's friends place and we all had a few drinks and played card games and such. I was with my fiance the whole time except for when I went to the bathroom. I remember everything from the night despite the alcohol in my system. We came home and continued drinking (just me and my fiance) and I eventually blacked out. I ended up having a dream about cheating on my partner with someone that I had seen earlier that night (well not really cheating just taking the guys hands and placing them in an odd place). But it's just that image in my head nothing else. I don't really remember waking up from it to realize it was a dream, I think I stirred but then went right back to sleep (i dont even remember)...I keep thinking what if it wasn't a dream what if it actually happened? My fiance keeps telling me he was with me the whole time and nothing happened but I think about the dream/image all day and it's driving me nuts! I always question whether I really have OCD or not and if the doc just diagnosed me to make me feel better and everything is true and real??? I have an appt with my psych tomorrow and I think I am going to have him write me a script for Zoloft...apparently it is an SSRI that doesn't cause weight gain. SSRI's are the only thing that seem to help me to accept uncertainty, but the thing that bothers me is I've never been able to say yes or no to the thoughts...but when I'm on the medication I'm kind of just like eh whatever and then the thought goes away. When I'm not I have crying spells and can't concentrate and just obsess and cry all day in the bathroom at work and also I get really bad separation anxiety from my fiance. Anyway I'm kind of just rambling just wanted to vent. Hope everyone is doing okay.</td>\n",

              "      <td>Hi all, hope you're all having a wonderful bank holiday whatever it is you're doing😎 I however am taking an introverted approach and just chilling and if you're reading this I thank you for taking your time out to read my first post on this forum and giving it some notice. I've taken some time out to read others experiences relating to OCD and other mental illnesses, knowing that I am not alone and gaining more insight to a really important topic and by reading other people's stories, by doing this I find that I'm learning more about myself as well. Some made me laugh, some made me cry. But thankyou nonetheless. What a great, lovely bunch of people. \\nJust to add a little context, I'm a 21 year old male, recently come to terms with the fact I have OCD. As well as this I also have GAD, major depression and an eating disorder. \\nNot getting into too much detail about the discovery of my OCD. Although rather impactful, it in some way has helped me knowing that there is a reason I am the way I am. I'm aware to not use the term 'Pure O' as it's not a medically used term and it is exactly the same as the more commonly known OCD subtypes. My compulsions are mainly in the mind. The themes are around harm, pedophilia, relationships, sexuality, existential, incest, depression and unfortunately the list goes on with various different themes. I've been having these thoughts for what it seems almost all my life. I always thought there was something wrong with me. When I was around 15/16, when I got into a conversation with a friend about mental illnesses. I knew from then on what I had to do, I had to diagnose myself with whatever it is that is wrong with me and I had to then give myself CBT before I get thrown in a loony bin or reported to the police as a danger or even worse, before I could act on them thoughts. For 6 years, that has been my mission. I thought, my intrusive thoughts were a part of me just waiting to burst out at any random moment. I thought that someday I'm going to wake up, something would switch in my brain and I would either black out and forget what I had done or even more frighteningly, actually be completely aware and actually taking pleasure in said scenarios based around my intrusive thoughts. I thought I had a monster, living inside me, just waiting for its perfect time to attack. I wouldn't know it until I knew it.\\nI have lived (and still live) in complete fear that I am my thoughts and they are a tremendous flaw in my personality. I guess I'm still yet to convince myself that it is true but as you all know, you have your ups and downs with this ever so painful disorder. It has been difficult to me, as Im coming to terms with having OCD, I am currently piecing together all my symptoms and all the intrusive thoughts I've ever had throughout my life. It's like they've all come back at me and I'm in a bit of a pickle. But, I will be getting help very soon, just waiting to find a specialist in OCD and CBT in the Sheffield area and I will be making steps to make my life manageable again as I seemed to of gone off the rails after some family related issues and the breakdown of my relationship with my amazing ex girlfriend. And I am hopeful, even though I am actually scared. And admitting to being scared is something I've never done, even though scared is what I've been all my life. However, opening up to my loved ones about my thoughts, I have received nothing but love, support and compassion and honestly... That's what I was most scared of, their reaction to my thoughts, and in that moment I knew that I had lived in fear for too long. They're heartbroken I'm going through this and have been for a long time, but only because they see me for what I don't. A normal, human being. Just like everyone else on this forum, or reading the forum. You're all normal, at least to us. And take comfort in that as did I when I came across these posts. \\nThere's a lyric that I've always been attached to, by a band called Meshuggah (shout out to all metal heads on this forum) and I'd love to share it. \\n'The struggle to free myself from restraints, becomes my very shackles.' \\nI hope that whoever reads this post, whether youre someone who has been diagnosed with OCD for years or someone who is finding answers. Please know you're not alone in this. And it will and can get better because ultimately you deserve it and you ought to have the drive to go out there and do it. Because you are not your thoughts. You know what you are, just look a little deeper, and you'll see you for the beautiful person you are, because all you're doing and all I'm doing, is our own disorderly way of protecting us from the things we fear the most. \\nHave a good one guys. Enjoy the glorious weather. Thankyou so much.</td>\n",

I realised that I actually am a bad person. When I look around I see normal and kind people; when I look at myself I see something disguting and weird (but not in a good way). This sounds silly but I received lots of presents today (I've never received so many before) and I felt so guilty. I don't deserve good things or people in my life. \\nBesides the fears of being attracted to children and being an abuser, I realised that I have so many other small obsessions. And they are absolutely disgusting. Take today for example. While having a nap with my boyfriend I had the feeling that I raped him by touching him in a weird way (by accident) and not doing anything about it for 30 seconds or so. While playing with my boyfriend's sister's cats I felt some sort of sick joy; I don't know if that was because I thought they were cute or because of something else. And these are only two examples, but there are so, so, so many other things that make me feel like a deviant and monster. My brain and body are so repugnant because they are the house of some of the most abnormal thoughts and feelings about the most normal things in the world, which automatically makes me a monster. And things would probably be easier if I were sure I didn't like all these feelings and thoughts, but here is the thing: I'm not sure. On the contrary, I think I do like and enjoy them, and I'm just too scared to accept it hence pretend to be scared, anxious and worried about it.\\nI think there is something seriously wrong with me. I'm a terrible person and I can feel it - I know this sounds weird but I can actually feel it. And because of that I don't want to be alive anymore, I really don't. For some reason I know I won't be able to survive like this for more than 10 (or even 5) years. I will never be happy with myslef; I'm way too rotten and evil inside for that to happen. \\nAgain, I apologise. I know this is not the post you would like to see during this festive period.</td>\n",

I could really use your help right now in identifying whether this is another OCD obsession or just my mind being corrupt\\nI hav suffered before with OCD obsessions about harming my family and it was the worst experience of my life. I did get treatment in the form of CBT and this helped. However, after my A level exams (which were STRESSFULL) my OCD has returned and now I obsess over harm, inappropriately touching people etc.\\nApart from this, a new obsession has come. Whenever I see any young child laughing or playing or just sitting (usually my 8 year old cousin who visits us) I start to have intrusive thought about negative experiences in my own childhood. My father was an alcoholic which left me with very panicky experiences. I get really distressed by thesehorrible reminders and I do cry.\\nAs a result, I avoid playing with my cousin at all costs so don't have to dwell on my own childhood and feel depressed. However, just seeing my cousin once brings these horrible memories which are followed by on-going thoughts in my mind that tell me\\n'I'm hopeless due to my childhood', 'I will never amount to anything' and 'My childhood made me this way'.\\nPlease help me. I need to know if this is another OCD obsession so I can find some peace of mind and know its not me being a bitter and twisted idiot.\\nSo is this OCD???</td>\n",

              "      <td>Though it comes in many flavors, one of the more common OCD themes we see on the forum is that of (no) crime and punishment. I wrote it that way for a reason. The sufferer believes they made an egregious mistake or have even committed a crime (what they did was so terrible), yet everyone else on the forum responds that no such crime exists or that the mistake is nothing to worry about. This theme has one thing in common: the sufferer's steadfast determination to punish themselves for the perceived transgression.\\nMany times someone will raise an issue like this on the forum, then vehemently stick to the belief that the situation has nothing to do with OCD. We see it so often here one would have to wonder how it could not be OCD, since the posts appear on an OCD forum. Further, people with this particular theme often have other, more easily identifiable versions of OCD, lending credence to the belief that the current problem is also OCD.\\nThe main reason why people balk at the thought that OCD is involved is that the situation (the crime) was real. OCD apparently didn't have any part in the formation of the crime/mistake. While that appears to be true in most cases of this theme, the person nonetheless is dealing with OCD now. Real mistakes or errors in judgment or perceived crimes can happen in real life. OCD comes into play when the person becomes overly focused on the mistake/crime/error to the detriment of their ability to live a quality life.\\nSometimes the 'crime' took place recently. In many cases it happened years and years ago but suddenly popped into the mind of the OCD sufferer. In all cases sufferers with this theme become obsessed with what happened. They fixate on the alleged crime and can't shake it from their mind. The thought of what happened (obsession) causes distress. And the sufferer performs compulsions, most notably ruminating -- going over the event in their mind repeatedly.\\nA notable manifestation of this theme is the very common belief that the crime/mistake/error made in the past is absolutely terrible. Sufferers commonly come across as being devastated that they made such a mistake, which they believe is life changing. Interestingly, the nearly unanimous verdict of responders to threads about this OCD theme is that the crime/mistake/error appears to be minor in origin and not worth worrying about.\\nOne by-product of this OCD theme and the way it manifests is what can be an overwhelming feeling of guilt. As everyone should know, OCD involves obsessions (intrusive thoughts) that cause distress. With this theme the majority of that distress is expressed as guilt. Consquently, sufferers with this theme commonly believe that they should be/must be punished for their transgression. This is expressed in self loathing comments and an interest shown in confessing the transgression to loved ones/the police.\\nOther people look at the situations and see they are minor incidents that should be dismissed, but the sufferers of this theme truly believe it is a case of crime and required punishment. Attempts at reassuring sufferers that they did not do bad, that they are not bad and that they deserve no punishment usually fall on deaf ears.\\nLike with other OCD themes, sufferers of this theme are their own worst enemies. Although the obsessions (thoughts that the sufferer did wrong) can be fleeting and last only seconds, sufferers can spend hours and hours ruminating on the subject. They can perform other compulsions, such as searching the Internet for stories of people who similarly screwed up, searching to find out what truly bad people do as a way of comparison, seeking reassurance and confessing.\\nInterestingly, with this OCD theme, the reassurance seeking can be the reverse of what is normally seen. While some people may ask for reassurance that they aren't a terrible person, some sufferers come across as if they want confirmation that they are bad and that what they did was egregious, terrible and worth punishment.\\nThis theme can result in cognitive distortions being exhibited, including all-or-nothing-thinking. \"\"\"\"I did X, therefore I am evil.\"\"\"\"\\nLike any other theme, this theme can be dealt with using the tenets of CBT. From the cognitive side the person can start saying positive statements as opposed to negative, all-or-nothing-thinking statements. (I am a good person. I make mistakes but I am still a good person).\\nOn the behavioral side, it is important that sufferers identify the compulsions they perform and work to resist them. No doubt ruminating is a big one with this theme. Refusal to confess past transgressions is essential, as is stopping searching on the Internet for similar stories.</td>\n",

I have had a noticeable increase in checking compulsions, but they don't seem to fit a particular theme. Some are clearly related to contamination (my usual OCD theme) but others don't seem to have a root at all. For example, I find it difficult to leave my office to go home. I check the windows, plug sockets, drawers etc., but it's more of a general unease that's driving it rather than a fear of something in particular.\\nWhen I get home, I find it really difficult to relax and forget about the day. Again, it's a general feeling of unease more than anything. I worry about how I come across to people, whether I'm meeting their expectations, do I really deserve to be in that job? I spend all evening running the days events through my mind to try and find answers to these questions, but of course it just winds me up even further.\\nI have a doctor's appointment on Monday to discuss my OCD symptoms but I'm not even sure what is OCD and what's not any more. Am I just wasting his time too? Everyone gets anxious when they start a new job. Is it just a normal response that I'm experiencing?\\nI've got the week off work next week when my son starts school. My brain is telling me that it'll be do me good to have a break but I really don't want to. I feel compelled to plough on until I feel at ease. It's making me anxious just thinking about taking time off because my brain is so desparately trying to find certainty, when to be honest it probably doesn't exist. It's just a matter of time, waiting until I settle in.\\nI suppose my problem is, I don't know what I'm dealing with. Is this all part of the OCD, does it fit a more GAD-type picture, or is it just a normal response to the stress of starting a new job? I really don't know any more!\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"prefLabel\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 4993,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"['hope', 'Intrusive thoughts', 'Thought', 'shock']\",\n          \"['Intrusive thoughts', 'anxiety', 'anxiety', 'fear', 'urge', 'Thought']\",\n          \"['Thought', 'depression', 'OCD', 'hope', 'obsession', 'symptom']\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"compulsion\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0,\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 1,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2,\n        \"samples\": [\n          1,\n          0\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"obsession\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0,\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 1,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2,\n        \"samples\": [\n          0,\n          1\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"expand1\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 1567,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Aggressive intrusive thoughts, Contamination intrusive thoughts, Doubt intrusive thoughts, Hoarding intrusive thoughts, Religious intrusive thoughts, Sexual intrusive thoughts, Somatic intrusive thoughts, Symmetry intrusive thoughts, morbid thoughts, Mental image, Homicidal thoughts, Persistent thoughts, Irrational thoughts, Suicidal ideation, Sexual thought, Aggressive thought, Contamination thought, Doubt thought, Hoarding thought, Obsessional thoughts, Religious thought, Somatic thought, Symmetry thought, talking on a phone, talking to someone, talking to yourself, talking [misc], Aggressive urge, Contamination urge, Doubt urge, Hoarding urge, Irrational urge, Religious urge, Sexual urge, Somatic urge, Symmetry urge, Compulsive behavior, Compulsion\",\n          \"castration anxiety, performance anxiety, koro, separation anxiety disorder, separation anxiety disorder, obsessive compulsive disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder, phobic disorder, phobic disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder, neurotic disorder, panic disorder, panic disorder, acute stress disorder, substance-induced anxiety disorder, specific phobia, specific phobia, social phobia, social phobia, agoraphobia, agoraphobia, combat disorder, nosophobia, animal phobia, flying phobia, cancerophobia, AIDS phobia, intense anxiety, addictive behavior, compulsive sexual behavior, repetitive compulsive behavior, nonparaphilic compulsive sexual behavior, compulsive masturbation, Compulsive buying, Compulsive checking, Compulsive cleaning, Compulsive counting, Compulsive eating, Compulsive gambling, Compulsive handwashing, Compulsive hoarding, Compulsive ordering, Compulsive touching, Compulsive washing, Repeating rituals, Ritual hand washing, annoyance, fury, rage, terror, panic, rage, wrath, LGBTQ wrath, gay male wrath, panic, moral panic, Compulsive behavior\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

My OCD had spiked and I was calling out sick for weeks. They were kind enough and felt bad I was so \"\"\"\"sick\"\"\"\" that laid me off so I could collect unemployment and keep my insurance benefits. My unemployment runs out next week.\\nI am doing much better now and though the prospect of going back to work scares me I do not have an option. My big concern is explaining the gap in my work history. It is not as though I can say, Hi, I have a mental illness and had a nervous breakdown.\\nI am also concerned because I have talk therapy once to twice a week to deal with my depression and PTSD, and I am supposed to be starting CBT soon. I am not sure how I would go about getting the time needed for these very important things.\\nDoes anyone have any advice to offer??\\nThanks so much in advance!!\\n~jenna   \n",

I've been going through a thing for some time when I would keep checking all the switches in our hallway. Some of them don't 'go' anywhere, they're just stray switches but then because they don't do anything, that seemed to stress me out even more in case I started a fire somewhere secret. But more than that, I'm afraid I might have been checking for them for the sake of checking.\\nThe truth is, I feel really upset and feel I'm setting too much store by my OCD right now, making myself sick and dizzy and hot by checking the switches night after night and I think I might have done it just because. I finally hit rock-bottom last night - there's one switch in particular that doesn't 'do anything', right next to the bathroom one. Both of them are outside the bathroom door. I keep checking both switches - even though it's obvious they're both turned off - and I keep checking and checking, counting to and fro in my head. I also get paranoid still about getting water on switches. Unfortunately, all this backwards and forwards kept making me want to go to the bathroom, which is a problem because it turns into a vicious circle.\\nI got into a state last night and told my dad everything and he told me to 'rationalise' and not check the switches. So now I'm not.\\nAnd this is the daft thing - but I feel really scared. I'm scared because I'm not doing it and I'm scared the game is finally up for me - that the whole world has done what it can for me and there's no more help I can be given. I'm scared because doing the rituals seem to have become part of me. I'm scared because I fear a kind of 'arrogance' taking me over and I'm scared of how I feel in case I sabotage my own chances of recovery - something I really fear doing.\\nI feel I need a distraction, but I'm not sure what. I'm just so scared of myself.\\nC x   \n",

I've just been feeling a little afraid, and worried I won't be able to trust myself, especially as my parents were quite keen on me coming back with them, and took a fair bit of persuasion to let me stay, because I was in desperate need of some space.\\n... On the plus side, I'm keeping myself busy! Anyone fancy a singalong to the Dennis the Menace theme tune?   \n",
              "3  I wanted to share with you this little illustration of why reassurance seeing doesn't work... I guess it might help someone, feel free to skip though as it's quite boring\\nso anyway, a few months ago I had an explosion of ocd, which prompted me to join this forum. It was by far the worst experience of ocd I've ever had, if not any kind of experience. I had this worry that I was going to be arrested for something that happened many years ago. I wanted - needed - certainty. I was absolutely desperate. It was the lowest I've ever been and I ended up in a pretty dark place.\\nAnyway I like to think I'm quite a rational minded person, so I wanted to look at the scientific odds of this happening. I'd read a self help book once that said this was a good way of reducing your worry.\\nI made a list of eight things that would have to happen in order for my worries to come true, and then gave an honest percentage to each event in terms of how likely they were to happen. My estimate was pretty generous as I was by this point quite convinced. I then multiplied them together and came out with a one in 300,000 chance of my worry coming true. I couldn't argue with maths: this was the truth.\\nSo for a couple of days I had a spring in my step, feeling like the world had been lifted. \"\"\"\"this reassurance DOES work\"\"\"\" I told myself.\\nBut then the doubt crept in. My brain wrapped itself round that one chance, even though it was one in three hundred thousand, at best. That \"\"\"\"one\"\"\"\" loomed large in my mind. It wasn't good enough. I started panicking, googling, asking, researching, ruminating, i felt sick all the time, I felt I couldn't go on and my life was over... in short I got stuck on the ocd roundabout and couldn't get off.\\nSo even though I was quite satisfied that the odds were infinitely small - much smaller than the chances of a car crash, getting cancer, having a heart attack etc (none of which worried me at all) - I was OBSESSED with this because I kept feeding the fire by carrying out my rituals.\\nSo I guess the point I wanted to get across is that... the reassurance seeking/researching never ever ever ever ever works because even if there's only one chance in three hundred thousand, or in a billion, ocd will still latch onto it. The ONLY way to move past it is to say \"\"\"\"ok, whatever, maybe that will happen, I can't read the future\"\"\"\" and get on with life.\\nI hope this doesn't seem at all condescending or preachy - that's not how I mean it at all, cos I still massively struggle with this! - it just really struck me as quite a stark illustration of how reassurance never works, no matter how tempting it is. So if anyone is reading this, desperate for certainty on a particular issue, please stop, you'll never get certainty - you don't need it! it's just ocd. Forget him and his bullying ways. just get on and enjoy your day xx   \n",

Plus social anxiety and insomnia. And depression and anger issues.\\nSo I think it's not really about getting rid of OCD, or getting read of PTSD, it's about getting a better mental health and having a greater quality of life overall. It's about making healthy choices in spite of your difficulties, and having a good therapist to guide your way and together with which to swim and make a little order in the myriad of thoughts we have. And it's about also realising that thoughts are just like clouds in the sky, they come and they go, and we sometimes have better and more enjoyable things to do than focus on them.\\nLife is worth living, after all.\\nI see a lot of people here talking about relapses, changing themes... I wanted to put this idea out here.\\nThree years ago my goal was to lose weight. I did everthing I could in order to achieve it, and I did. After I did it, I started being lazy, I stopped exercising and eating healthy, and here I am, three years later, 40 pounds overweight.\\nNobody expects to stay in great shape if they stop exercising and stop eating healthy. So why is it that some would expect to stop doing what's healthy for them mentally and have great mental health?\\nThe brain is a muscle, and as any muscle we have, if we stop training it it gets soggy.\\nWhen we develop OCD is an alarm signal to start doing those healthy things which we know are healthy for us. But really, everyone could benefit from training their brains: through meditation, mindfulness, exercising, eating healthy, learning when it is worthy to worry and when it is not...\\nWe are not our OCD, BPD, PTSD and the key to recovery is to make recovery from OCD a byproduct of the healthy lifestyle choices you make: act according to your values, in spite of your fears, do the things you wanna do, work towards your goals, cultivate your passions, and others.\\nThat's what I believe is the key not only to recovery from OCD for good, but olso to build a more happier, meaningul life.\\nI, for one, now that I admitted that I might also have these other two mental disorders, apart from the three I knew I had, I am determined to change. I am determined to work hard towards recovering from PTSD and BPD and OCD and develop the mental tools which will help me further along in my journey through life, to put all these mental health issues behind.\\nI encourage you all to have faith in yourself, in your ability to change and in your ability to make life as you want it.\\nPeace.   \n",

I've been going through a thing for some time when I would keep checking all the switches in our hallway. Some of them don't 'go' anywhere, they're just stray switches but then because they don't do anything, that seemed to stress me out even more in case I started a fire somewhere secret. But more than that, I'm afraid I might have been checking for them for the sake of checking.\\nThe truth is, I feel really upset and feel I'm setting too much store by my OCD right now, making myself sick and dizzy and hot by checking the switches night after night and I think I might have done it just because. I finally hit rock-bottom last night - there's one switch in particular that doesn't 'do anything', right next to the bathroom one. Both of them are outside the bathroom door. I keep checking both switches - even though it's obvious they're both turned off - and I keep checking and checking, counting to and fro in my head. I also get paranoid still about getting water on switches. Unfortunately, all this backwards and forwards kept making me want to go to the bathroom, which is a problem because it turns into a vicious circle.\\nI got into a state last night and told my dad everything and he told me to 'rationalise' and not check the switches. So now I'm not.\\nAnd this is the daft thing - but I feel really scared. I'm scared because I'm not doing it and I'm scared the game is finally up for me - that the whole world has done what it can for me and there's no more help I can be given. I'm scared because doing the rituals seem to have become part of me. I'm scared because I fear a kind of 'arrogance' taking me over and I'm scared of how I feel in case I sabotage my own chances of recovery - something I really fear doing.\\nI feel I need a distraction, but I'm not sure what.

I guess it might help someone, feel free to skip though as it's quite boring\\nso anyway, a few months ago I had an explosion of ocd, which prompted me to join this forum. It was by far the worst experience of ocd I've ever had, if not any kind of experience. I had this worry that I was going to be arrested for something that happened many years ago. I wanted - needed - certainty. I was absolutely desperate. It was the lowest I've ever been and I ended up in a pretty dark place.\\nAnyway I like to think I'm quite a rational minded person, so I wanted to look at the scientific odds of this happening. I'd read a self help book once that said this was a good way of reducing your worry.\\nI made a list of eight things that would have to happen in order for my worries to come true, and then gave an honest percentage to each event in terms of how likely they were to happen. My estimate was pretty generous as I was by this point quite convinced. I then multiplied them together and came out with a one in 300,000 chance of my worry coming true. I couldn't argue with maths: this was the truth.\\nSo for a couple of days I had a spring in my step, feeling like the world had been lifted. \"\"\"\"this reassurance DOES work\"\"\"\" I told myself.\\nBut then the doubt crept in. My brain wrapped itself round that one chance, even though it was one in three hundred thousand, at best. That \"\"\"\"one\"\"\"\" loomed large in my mind. It wasn't good enough. I started panicking, googling, asking, researching, ruminating, i felt sick all the time, I felt I couldn't go on and my life was over... in short I got stuck on the ocd roundabout and couldn't get off.\\nSo even though I was quite satisfied that the odds were infinitely small - much smaller than the chances of a car crash, getting cancer, having a heart attack etc (none of which worried me at all) - I was OBSESSED with this because I kept feeding the fire by carrying out my rituals.\\nSo I guess the point I wanted to get across is that... the reassurance seeking/researching never ever ever ever ever works because even if there's only one chance in three hundred thousand, or in a billion, ocd will still latch onto it. The ONLY way to move past it is to say \"\"\"\"ok, whatever, maybe that will happen, I can't read the future\"\"\"\" and get on with life.\\nI hope this doesn't seem at all condescending or preachy - that's not how I mean it at all, cos I still massively struggle with this! - it just really struck me as quite a stark illustration of how reassurance never works, no matter how tempting it is. So if anyone is reading this, desperate for certainty on a particular issue, please stop, you'll never get certainty - you don't need it! it's just ocd.

Plus social anxiety and insomnia. And depression and anger issues.\\nSo I think it's not really about getting rid of OCD, or getting read of PTSD, it's about getting a better mental health and having a greater quality of life overall. It's about making healthy choices in spite of your difficulties, and having a good therapist to guide your way and together with which to swim and make a little order in the myriad of thoughts we have. And it's about also realising that thoughts are just like clouds in the sky, they come and they go, and we sometimes have better and more enjoyable things to do than focus on them.\\nLife is worth living, after all.\\nI see a lot of people here talking about relapses, changing themes... I wanted to put this idea out here.\\nThree years ago my goal was to lose weight. I did everthing I could in order to achieve it, and I did. After I did it, I started being lazy, I stopped exercising and eating healthy, and here I am, three years later, 40 pounds overweight.\\nNobody expects to stay in great shape if they stop exercising and stop eating healthy. So why is it that some would expect to stop doing what's healthy for them mentally and have great mental health?\\nThe brain is a muscle, and as any muscle we have, if we stop training it it gets soggy.\\nWhen we develop OCD is an alarm signal to start doing those healthy things which we know are healthy for us. But really, everyone could benefit from training their brains: through meditation, mindfulness, exercising, eating healthy, learning when it is worthy to worry and when it is not...\\nWe are not our OCD, BPD, PTSD and the key to recovery is to make recovery from OCD a byproduct of the healthy lifestyle choices you make: act according to your values, in spite of your fears, do the things you wanna do, work towards your goals, cultivate your passions, and others.\\nThat's what I believe is the key not only to recovery from OCD for good, but olso to build a more happier, meaningul life.\\nI, for one, now that I admitted that I might also have these other two mental disorders, apart from the three I knew I had, I am determined to change. I am determined to work hard towards recovering from PTSD and BPD and OCD and develop the mental tools which will help me further along in my journey through life, to put all these mental health issues behind.\\nI encourage you all to have faith in yourself, in your ability to change and in your ability to make life as you want it.\\nPeace.</td>\n",

Please suggest me.\\nEdited May 15, 2018 by worriedjohn\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"prefLabel\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 1338,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"['Treatment', 'toilet', 'interest', 'anxiety', 'anxiety', 'OCD']\",\n          \"['Rituals', 'interest', 'outside', 'role', 'Treatment', 'Activity', 'Thought', 'OCD']\",\n          \"['washing hands', 'joy', 'fall', 'OCD', 'Thought']\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"postAnnotations\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 67,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"['intrusive thought', 'theme']\",\n          \"['rumination', 'sensation', 'obsessive']\",\n          \"[\\u2018Rituals\\u2019]\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"mergedAnnotations\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 1343,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"['shaking', 'anxiety', 'social media', 'depression', 'fear', 'Thought', 'spike', 'OCD']\",\n          \"['rumination', 'process', 'Treatment', 'Thought', 'spike', 'OCD']\",\n          \"['flatulence', 'washing hands', 'gastroenteritis', 'enteritis', 'fear', 'toilet', 'symptom', 'OCD']\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"enriched-ontology-obsession\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0.0,\n        \"min\": 1.0,\n        \"max\": 1.0,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 1,\n        \"samples\": [\n          1.0\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"enriched-ontology-compulsion\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0.0,\n        \"min\": 1.0,\n        \"max\": 1.0,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 1,\n        \"samples\": [\n          1.0\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"obsession-expert\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0.4823065112637651,\n        \"min\": 0.0,\n        \"max\": 1.0,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2,\n        \"samples\": [\n          0.0\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Compulsion-expert\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0.4907304010662191,\n        \"min\": 0.0,\n        \"max\": 1.0,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2,\n        \"samples\": [\n          1.0\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Explanation\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 112,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"I still had the thoughts and the rituals, they were no where near as bad as before I was taking the Seroxat.\\n\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

              "1  The truth is, I feel really upset and feel I'm setting too much store by my OCD right now, making myself sick and dizzy and hot by checking the switches night after night and I think I might have done it just because. I finally hit rock-bottom last night - there's one switch in particular that doesn't 'do anything', right next to the bathroom one. Both of them are outside the bathroom door. I keep checking both switches - even though it's obvious they're both turned off - and I keep checking and checking, counting to and fro in my head. I also get paranoid still about getting water on switches. Unfortunately, all this backwards and forwards kept making me want to go to the bathroom, which is a problem because it turns into a vicious circle./ I'm scared because doing the rituals seem to have become part of me.\\n   \n",

              "3  i wanted to share with you this little illustration of why reassurance seeing doesnt work guess it might help someone feel free to skip though as its quite boring so anyway few months ago had an explosion of ocd which prompted me to join this forum it was by far the worst experience of ocd ive ever had if not any kind of experience had this worry that was going to be arrested for something that happened many years ago wanted needed certainty was absolutely desperate it was the lowest ive ever been and ended up in pretty dark place anyway like to think im quite rational minded person so wanted to look at the scientific odds of this happening id read self help book once that said this was good way of reducing your worry made list of eight things that would have to happen in order for my worries to come true and then gave an honest percentage to each event in terms of how likely they were to happen my estimate was pretty generous as was by this point quite convinced then multiplied them together and came out with one in chance of my worry coming true couldnt argue with maths this was the truth so for couple of days had spring in my step feeling like the world had been lifted this reassurance does work told myself but then the doubt crept in my brain wrapped itself round that one chance even though it was one in three hundred thousand at best that one loomed large in my mind it wasnt good enough started panicking googling asking researching ruminating felt sick all the time felt couldnt go on and my life was over in short got stuck on the ocd roundabout and couldnt get off so even though was quite satisfied that the odds were infinitely small much smaller than the chances of car crash getting cancer having heart attack etc none of which worried me at all was obsessed with this because kept feeding the fire by carrying out my rituals so guess the point wanted to get across is that the reassurance seekingresearching never ever ever ever ever works because even if theres only one chance in three hundred thousand or in billion ocd will still latch onto it the only way to move past it is to say ok whatever maybe that will happen cant read the future and get on with life hope this doesnt seem at all condescending or preachy thats not how mean it at all cos still massively struggle with this it just really struck me as quite stark illustration of how reassurance never works no matter how tempting it is so if anyone is reading this desperate for certainty on particular issue please stop youll never get certainty you dont need it its just ocd forget him and his bullying ways just get on and enjoy your day xx  \n",

contamination worry about asbestos lead other metals glass stone sand any dust of any kind chemicals basically any foreign substance or possible poison entering my own but mainly my sons body and causing harm thats bit of background on tuesday was rushed into hospital with suspected ectopic pregnancy in ae in the rush and chaos of it all nurse put cannula into my arm behind my elbow to administer morphine another drip of liquid and to also get blood from me she did terrible job and after several failed attempts finally got the cannula into my arm but badly they were unable to get blood from it about an inch came out before they tried dragging more out which was yucky substance instead of blood anyway as result my arm is in right mess its heavily bruised hurting so badly now even though it was days ago and the ocd has hooked into this and is now trying to convince me that the needle snapped in my arm and is now floating around in my bloodstream know this is not the case well the none ocd bit of me does but all day since the thought first entered my head its been driving me mad the thing im asking for help with is how to deal with the thoughts now am confident with cbt techniques for contamination not washing my hands touching stuff dont want to touch etc but if the rituals havent yet started what can do to make sure they dont start im feeling the need to keep my arm below my heart to ask for reassurance to google etc but resisting doing all those things this is the right thing to do isnt it is there any other techniques can use since being in hospital ive had several other ocd spikes about it all but this one seems to be the one ive hooked into grr btw me and baby are both fine thank god\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n
