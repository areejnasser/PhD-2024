For demo how to use the obsession model download 'Use_BioBERT_model_obsession_expert_tested.ipynb' and run from Colab preferably (as it require cuda). 
[![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/areejnasser/PhD-2024/blob/main/Toward%20Obsessive-Compulsive%20Disorder%20Classification%20System/Classifiation%20of%20OCD/Use_BioBERT_model_obsession_expert_tested.ipynb)


The repository 'Classification of OCD' contains four sub-folders. The description of each folder is as follows:

1. BERT_training_split -->  has two python scripts used to create Obsession and Compulsion model trained based on the BERT pre trained model. 

The link to the model is found here: 

BERT Obsession model --> (https://drive.google.com/file/d/1eshin6DQm7bcsIdM2uVMCf2g0D-fpEB7/view?usp=share_link)

BERT Compulsion model --> (https://drive.google.com/file/d/1eshin6DQm7bcsIdM2uVMCf2g0D-fpEB7/view?usp=share_link)


The dataset to train the model is found in the folder named data.
