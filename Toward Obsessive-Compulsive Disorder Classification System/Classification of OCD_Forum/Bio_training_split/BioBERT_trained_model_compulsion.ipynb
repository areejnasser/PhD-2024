I have no one to talk to about this so I always feel trapped and alone. I've tried talking to my mum and I thought she understoodcat first but now when I go to talk to her it's as if she's just blocking me out and does not want to deal with the fact that her daughter is mad:( xx\\nEdited August 23, 2013 by RiHa\",\n          \"I started a new job last month and I've been experiencing an increase in anxiety since then. I have had a noticeable increase in checking compulsions, but they don't seem to fit a particular theme. Some are clearly related to contamination (my usual OCD theme) but others don't seem to have a root at all. For example, I find it difficult to leave my office to go home. I check the windows, plug sockets, drawers etc., but it's more of a general unease that's driving it rather than a fear of something in particular.\\nWhen I get home, I find it really difficult to relax and forget about the day. Again, it's a general feeling of unease more than anything. I worry about how I come across to people, whether I'm meeting their expectations, do I really deserve to be in that job? I spend all evening running the days events through my mind to try and find answers to these questions, but of course it just winds me up even further.\\nI have a doctor's appointment on Monday to discuss my OCD symptoms but I'm not even sure what is OCD and what's not any more. Am I just wasting his time too? Everyone gets anxious when they start a new job. Is it just a normal response that I'm experiencing?\\nI've got the week off work next week when my son starts school. My brain is telling me that it'll be do me good to have a break but I really don't want to. I feel compelled to plough on until I feel at ease. It's making me anxious just thinking about taking time off because my brain is so desparately trying to find certainty, when to be honest it probably doesn't exist. It's just a matter of time, waiting until I settle in.\\nI suppose my problem is, I don't know what I'm dealing with. Is this all part of the OCD, does it fit a more GAD-type picture, or is it just a normal response to the stress of starting a new job? I really don't know any more!\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"prefLabel\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 4993,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"['hope', 'Intrusive thoughts', 'Thought', 'shock']\",\n          \"['Intrusive thoughts', 'anxiety', 'anxiety', 'fear', 'urge', 'Thought']\",\n          \"['Thought', 'depression', 'OCD', 'hope', 'obsession', 'symptom']\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"compulsion\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0,\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 1,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2,\n        \"samples\": [\n          1,\n          0\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"obsession\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0,\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 1,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2,\n        \"samples\": [\n          0,\n          1\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"expand1\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 1567,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Aggressive intrusive thoughts, Contamination intrusive thoughts, Doubt intrusive thoughts, Hoarding intrusive thoughts, Religious intrusive thoughts, Sexual intrusive thoughts, Somatic intrusive thoughts, Symmetry intrusive thoughts, morbid thoughts, Mental image, Homicidal thoughts, Persistent thoughts, Irrational thoughts, Suicidal ideation, Sexual thought, Aggressive thought, Contamination thought, Doubt thought, Hoarding thought, Obsessional thoughts, Religious thought, Somatic thought, Symmetry thought, talking on a phone, talking to someone, talking to yourself, talking [misc], Aggressive urge, Contamination urge, Doubt urge, Hoarding urge, Irrational urge, Religious urge, Sexual urge, Somatic urge, Symmetry urge, Compulsive behavior, Compulsion\",\n          \"castration anxiety, performance anxiety, koro, separation anxiety disorder, separation anxiety disorder, obsessive compulsive disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder, phobic disorder, phobic disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder, neurotic disorder, panic disorder, panic disorder, acute stress disorder, substance-induced anxiety disorder, specific phobia, specific phobia, social phobia, social phobia, agoraphobia, agoraphobia, combat disorder, nosophobia, animal phobia, flying phobia, cancerophobia, AIDS phobia, intense anxiety, addictive behavior, compulsive sexual behavior, repetitive compulsive behavior, nonparaphilic compulsive sexual behavior, compulsive masturbation, Compulsive buying, Compulsive checking, Compulsive cleaning, Compulsive counting, Compulsive eating, Compulsive gambling, Compulsive handwashing, Compulsive hoarding, Compulsive ordering, Compulsive touching, Compulsive washing, Repeating rituals, Ritual hand washing, annoyance, fury, rage, terror, panic, rage, wrath, LGBTQ wrath, gay male wrath, panic, moral panic, Compulsive behavior\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}",
