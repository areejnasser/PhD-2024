more aptly, intrusive thoughts. I believed they were a reflection of who I am, but recently I have learned the very opposite. They are exactly who I am not. It is not real. There is a dark honesty about the next few paragraphs, but I feel it needs to be told.\\nMy intrusive thoughts (intrusions) have always been violent. From as young as 4, I remember thinking about death. A little older, about killing, rape, murder. Under the age of 10, I would constantly be haunted by thoughts of torturing people around me. Inappropriate acts of violence. And even though I didn’t understand it, acts of sexual violence. These thoughts came in fast and in succession. They become constant, repulsive, extremely distressing. When I was little, I recognised intrusions as bad thoughts. I knew I shouldn’t be having them but I didn’t know how to communicate them to others. They could be so frightening, it almost felt like my own mind was blackmailing me. To make matters worse, obsessive thoughts ugly brother, consequence stepped in. Consequence took my compulsions and mixed them up with my obsessions. It reared its head in the voice that speaks, “If you don’t match all of the spoons up together, your mum will die today”. “If don’t you cross your toes when your legs are crossed, you will crash your car into those school children.” “If you don’t wash your hands 3 times in the 12 step process, your house will be robbed while you are at work”.',\n"," 'I have been thinking so much about Covid because it’s part of my job and well, who isn’t, right? The concern for me was about all the encouraged hand washing and OCD. Would that scratch that OCD itch in my brain? I got tired real quick about singing ‘happy birthday’ while washing my hands and it became clear to me that this is like life in that we can’t be perfect and striving to perfectly eliminate all risk is just not gonna happen, and increase anxiety. I have fear of contamination and that might get worse with Covid-19. I have to manage my thought I know it is irrational and I am cleaned but do it for revealing. ',\n"," 'I’ve noticed that I’ve been washing my hands more lately, that things are triggering a need to wash my hands and that I’m giving in to those triggers more often. This scares me. I need to be careful and work on not giving in. But like today I washed my hands quite a few times that I probably didn’t really need to. But it really felt like I needed to in that moment. And just going ahead and washing seemed easier than waiting out the need.\\nI’ve been having such a difficult time lately with depression. Therapy is so hard. But I’ve been holding on to all the progress I made in OCD therapy, and that helps me keep working on depression stuff in therapy. I keep remind myself that I got better, that I got control of OCD. OCD is irrational.  Hopefully I get better soon. ',\n"," \"I just don't get whats wrong. I'm getting so much worse. I was in my room from 2-7pm today tapping with no break. I can't stop crying I'm sooooo scares. I know you can't help me but, well, I don't know - I may as well ask? It’s the part that I’ve just indulged somewhat and potentially has become worse over the years. I struggle to feel safe, comfortable if I’m not sure something is done, such as locking the door. There is no reason for why I feel the need to check all the time  I know there is no need, it is unrealistic thought feel terrified of the consequences or visions of which pass my mind. I have never forgot anything before but these thoughts that I have devour my mind. I will check and check and check but I will still question it. To help reassure myself on this I take a picture and clap (or memorable action). I feel like I am in the same circle.\",\n"," 'JokesASide;\\nObsessive Compulsive Disorder, otherwise known as OCD is far more extensive than a malady of someone that flicks the odd light switch 3 times in a row, or thinks they’ve left their straighteners on, when in fact they haven’t. It is reflective of complete panic, anxiety and guilt which affects every aspect of life for those who suffer from it.\\nOCD has always been part of my life, since I can remember. It isn’t something I talk about often, due to the lack of knowledge on the audience part. But as I get older, the harder it is to cope with my OCD “ticks”, “rituals” and “repetition”.\\nNo one really knows the depths of my disorder, but friends and family like to speculate and analyze a situation that has occurred where I have freaked out when my food Is touching each other on my plate, or I’ve had to leave a do early to go check if my straighteners are on or they see me sitting down and then getting back up 5 times in a row.\\nFrom as far back as I can remember, OCD has played a vital role in my life. I’ve always been very sporty, adventurous and sociable, however, even talking to someone can cause stress which is so overwhelming. Friends and family always laugh and say “It’s a Courtney moment”, “We love you the way you are, warts and all”.\\nEven in my early teenage years, my mom had to force me to walk on the cracks in the pavement, reassuring me that I won’t die if I stand on a line, or that an family member won’t get severely ill if I walk on equal number of pavement s',\n"," 'There is a risk, however small, that tomorrow I will walk under a bus. There is a risk that I may get Ebola (can you guess what my OCD might be especially keen on at the moment?), that I might cause an accident, that I might hurt someone unintentionally, that I might leave my cooker on and burn down the entire student residenceâ¦ the list goes on. Every day we take a million tiny decisions and a million tiny risks.\\nWorse than all of that though is the risk that I choose not to take. There is also the risk that I donât face up to my OCD and that it ends up consuming my life, my dreams and my future.\\nYou see, life is dangerous. There is scary stuff out there. And yet we have to make that choice â do we accept the uncertain, the unknowns and live with it (as those without OCD seem to do), or do we allow OCD to try to reduce those risks and spiral into isolation and fear, anxiety and terror. You see, in the face of uncertainty, I will (like most humans) leap to the worst possible conclusion. Instead of accepting uncertainty I will do everything I can to strive for the impossible, 100% certainty.\\nA huge part of facing my OCD has been about accepting uncertainty. I might get Ebola, but I might not, but those extra hours I spend washing my hands are definitely hours that I won’t get back.

She basically suggested that as humans we are still programmed to run on adrenaline as soon as we wake up in order to hunt and gather food. I never ate breakfast, just a coffee until midday. I'm forcing myself to eat breakfast and id like to report a definite decrease in morning anxiety! I know that caffeine can effect your mood so I'm trying (and failing) to cut down, although I've been looking Into it quite a bit and some studies seem to suggest that consuming high levels of sugar can be detrimental to your mental health. For me personally, when I have too much sugar I get shaky and my mind seems to jump about the place even more. So I'm thinking about trying to eliminate sugar from my diet for a while and seeing if it has any impact on my anxiety. I was wondering, has anyone else found reducing certain food groups/additives etc has improved your overall mood? Don't get me wrong I'm in no way saying cutting out sugar will definitely help, I don't know if it would and that's why I'm asking you guys what you think definitely becoming a believer in the idea that looking after yourself in every way you can can give you that little push\",\n"," 'Hi -\\nSo I haven\\'t been on here since December since I was recovering.

I wrote it that way for a reason. The sufferer believes they made an egregious mistake or have even committed a crime (what they did was so terrible), yet everyone else on the forum responds that no such crime exists or that the mistake is nothing to worry about. This theme has one thing in common: the sufferer's steadfast determination to punish themselves for the perceived transgression.\\nMany times someone will raise an issue like this on the forum, then vehemently stick to the belief that the situation has nothing to do with OCD. We see it so often here one would have to wonder how it could not be OCD, since the posts appear on an OCD forum. Further, people with this particular theme often have other, more easily identifiable versions of OCD, lending credence to the belief that the current problem is also OCD.\\nThe main reason why people balk at the thought that OCD is involved is that the situation (the crime) was real. OCD apparently didn't have any part in the formation of the crime/mistake. While that appears to be true in most cases of this theme, the person nonetheless is dealing with OCD now. Real mistakes or errors in judgment or perceived crimes can happen in real life. OCD comes into play when the person becomes overly focused on the mistake/crime/error to the detriment of their ability to live a quality life.\\nSometimes the 'crime' took plac\",\n"," 'Hey there,\\nfirst of all sorry for my English.

But lately, I’m not even sure if it’s OCD anymore. Since about May I’ve been terrified of committing suicide.

I stopped asking loved ones for reassurance, and the false memories disappeared entirely. I’d like to say it was like being able to see clearly, but I don’t think anybody felt they could see clearly last year.

I've had some success in the past dealing with OCD and have a pretty good understanding of how to combat it using CBT techniques.\\nHowever, some new obsessions have arisen as a result of the head injury that lead me to perform mental checking rituals.\\nIn the past, most of my compulsive behaviours have been physical or at least active. In other words, if there was a mental component it usually involved me actively doing something intentionally. My new obsession relates to worries about banging my head. Although I'm attempting to avoid doing any physical or intentional rituals, I find myself engaging in mental checking almost passively or automatically. For example: I might try to remember how close my head was to the wall or how hard I touched my head with my hand. I'm attempting to avoid doing this on purpose but I find the mental checking happening without intention.\\nI was wondering if anybody had any thoughts or advice on how to deal with this kind of checking.

With me a thought may try to hound me until I am physically crying or end up arguing with it, in which case it wins. Getting angry with a certain distressing thought makes OCD stronger. It doesn't matter if you are the nicest person in the world, you will still get distessing thoughts at some point. I think this is due to your brain/mind trying to make sense of the world we live in. I've mentined this technique before but I'll say it again in case anbody reading this doesn't know of it: if a distsressing thought comes, think to yourself OCD, so that your brain/mind can register it as an OCD thought, and the thought should go away.\\nThis really does work so don't give up trying this.

Basically, when you suffer from OCD, it's very easy to get sucked up into negative feelings. Bad thoughts, bad moods, bad everything. And I've started doing this in order to remind myself that, actually, even in the thick of all this nastiness, there are still things that can be valued and make us happy.\\nSo basically, the idea is this: Keep a diary for 100 days straight in which you make at least one entry every day about what made you happy. These things can be as big or small as you deem appropriate. It doesn't have to be as personal as I've done it (I'm keeping a diary), for example, my friend is putting up a picture on facebook every day of one thing that made her happy. It doesn't have to be huge, you don't have to force it, and you don't have to always feel like it's 'worthy' of an entry. It just has to be SOMETHING. For example, my first entry was coffee. The day of that entry was horrible, awful stress from college, awful time with the OCD, awful time with the people in my waking life... Rubbish day. BUT.

All I did to overcome it was simply the opposite of everything I felt compelled to do. If I wanted things straight, I\\'d make them crooked. Perfect, then imperfect. Clean, then messy. It was one of the most liberating experiences of my life! I sort of transformed into a circus clown for a bit of time due to how much glee and freedom I felt. Don\\'t let anyone tell you that it is only something that can be coped with but not fully healed. I am 1,000% healed, and you can be to! When you feel a bit of tension due to some obsessive habit not being obeyed, just know that that tension will steadily decrease as you continue to joyfully disobey what you feel needs to be ordered, straightened, etc.. I wish you complete success! I have another friend who also became fully healed due to someone simply telling him in regards to his unseemly habits, \"\"Just stop doing it.\"\" It IS as simple as that and, once again, remember that any initial tension due to not performing a certain habit will eventually be replaced by exuberant freedom! Doing the opposite is most certainly the quickest way to taste that freedom as opposed to simply not doing the habit.

My first symptoms came in the form of rituals during my childhood. Though I was able to suppress the rituals for about a year, they came back in force. I also suffered from Tourettes as a kid but nobody understood what it was then (I was living in Asia then and psychiatry there and in the 1970's was less enlightened than it is today).\\nMy OCD manifested itself primarily in the form of obsessions during my late adolesence during which I was diagnosed with OCD. It was already pretty bad then. I did not at the time do Y-BOCS test but I was obsessing perhaps more than 16 hours a day and feeling very anxious and perpetually asking for reassurance. I changed environments and the obsessions which were context specific to the prior environment went away for a while (about 1.5 years).\\nIt was during my first semester in college that I came across a group of religious students (born-again types) on campus that my real obsessing started. Now, religion is a terrible subject to obssess about - especially when it often preaches punitive measures (US-Centric phenomenon) and obssessive concerns can mask itself as legititmate piety amongst peers.

I have been a severe sufferer of OCD for the past 11 almost 12 years. It began when I was 7, and I sadly lost my parents in a tragic accident, and not long after their death I developed Obsessive Compulsive Disorder. I have always thought myself kind of crazy, because my ritual is actually pretty dangerous and I have been in hospital due to effects of it on more than one occasion. My OCD revolves pretty much around numbers and magical thinking. I have huge supersticious thoughts but the main issue surrounds the number after 12. (Triskaidekaphobia) and the devils number. I can't say it or see it and when I do my ritual is counting loudly and repeating each number 7 times, and then I hurt myself. It is pretty scary, and I actually currently have my arm in a bandage after an event including scissors a few nights ago. (I'm okay ). In late August, I actually was hospitalised after I stabbed my own side with a knife, which was extremely dangerous. I have been having CBT sessions and E&R sessions once a week since and I can see an improvement, and I have also been given different medication which is effective.

I check, organise, plan, wash hands, check doors, worry about everything, have intrusive thoughts, play out future events in my head its all normal to me to do that. Who will I be without it?

I have had my 1st CBT session today which i have been waiting anxiously for for about 6 months. My therapist is lovely but i am worried about what sort of things he will help my confront- i have a big fear of physically harming people close to me who i love very much. He made a joke about having me sit with a big knife next to me while talking to him in the sessions and being around the people i am scared of harming do you think hes serious? I think i would have a nervous breakdown! I know its like exposure therapy but i am sooooo scared of getting worse and back to way i was last year. Do you guys who have had CBT think that you have to get worse before you get better?

The emphasis is on quality, in terms of training and in terms of treatment, in order for this programme to be successful. Main points raised in the lecture include the need for patients to be treated near to where they live - preferably on GP premises - , effective supervision and management of therapists and offering professional advancement based on work excellence.\\nWhat makes this programme different is that instead of referrals from Gps, therapies will be delivered through treatment centres, which would firstly be useful for patients who do not want to go to their GP. In addition, therapists would be monitored to ensure quality of treatment, and the centres would be focused on providing in-house training and professional development. Centres would concentrate on CBT and be separate from CMHTs, these dealing with more seriously ill patients. All these aspects would contribute to a nationwide dedication to mental health services.\\nLooking ahead five years, it is estimated by Lord Layard that there would be ',\n"," 'Tomorrow I have my second visit to the psychotherapist, but I am worrying about it.

Wanted to curl up in a ball and die. Desperation and crying out for help. So many questions. How could this happen to me when i have had ocd since a child? Surely i should know the drill by now?

Duracell Bunny mode as my therapist called it. Everything was done in fast forward and stressed to the nines. Trying to cure myself but not having the patience to wait. The overbearing need to beat OCD once and for all so as not to cause others pain. The guilt felt for not being myself and strong for my children.\\nStage 3 - Fed up. Burn out. No motivation, Isolation, Feel no one to turn to. The burden of putting on a front to friends and family so they do not worry but feeling so alone.

One thing I notice is that OCD will try to seep in with an easy non intrusive thought that will open my mind and a few minutes later I am panicked.\\nThere have been lots of ups and down. During the down times it is difficult not to feel resigned with thoughts like I was doing so good yesterday now I'm back to square 1.

My Mum thinks asking me to hold a knife to her is therapy, if she does it once, she'll cure me. She's not the biggest victim of my OCD, my husband is. She also accused me earlier of having a 'painting OCD'. Truth of the matter is not that I'm obsessed with painting, it's just taken me 3 weeks to get the decorating done because I get so caught up with my obsessions!\\nLast night the causing harm got a little bit bad. With so many police outside the property I kept thinking about the police presence if I killed my husband. Today we have scene of crime officers here, so I'm thinking (obsessing) over them turning up to photograph the scene of the crime when I kill my husband. It just feels so imminent and this high police presence just makes it wo\",\n"," \"Hi, just needed to write. My OCD is quite bad at the moment, I was getting slighlty better now its come back, I had started going to a therapist a few months ago, but due to different reasons I stopped. Now I've got to the point where I want to do something. I want to try 1st on my own, then maybe go back. Someone said to me about trying hypnosis. What do you think? I feel so frustrated, I wish I could just do normal things like everyone else, like getting ready to go out, takes me at least 1hr 15 mins ish ( to long anyway) I take ages having a shower, washing re washing, rinsing etc. Then Getting dressed takes ages, cause i have to check all my clothes before I put them on, to make sure there is nothing on/in them to drop out.( i know that sounds stupid) but I worry about losing my personal things. Then if I'm last to go out in the house I have to check all the plugs, locks , windows etc. which i sometimes have to check again cause don't trust myself, sometimes asking some1 else if their there, which is alot at the moment,I just can't cope with doing it. I can't even use the toilet without cleaning it 1st then after i've used it! Then when I'm eventually out, I have to keep checking I've not dropped anything, and when get out the car have to check, get something out my bag i have to check etc etc. Thats just a few I suppose the main ones but they are driving me mad.

I told her that when I first started taking them I was told by my psychiatrist it would not be forever and I have had serious weight gain. Now, I admit I have always been a bit bigger and do not exercise as one should because of my fibromyalgia but I have gained near 5 stone in the last two years!!

At one point in my life, I couldn't use the internet without someone sitting next to me, then I couldn't go on the computer without a piece of paper covering the keyboard (so that I couldn't type horrible things), I also use to write down what sites and what I was doing every half a minute on pieces of paper, it was so tiring...\\nAny way I'm better with the internet fears (I'm on the net on my own, typing this right now!), so I did something I couldn't imagine doing all those years a go.\\nI have a real soft spot for the lovely singer/actor/writer called Chris Colfer of Glee fame, yes I'm thirty but I'm a bit of fan girl.

So without worry (well I worried a bit) I sent off a letter/email telling him a bit about my ocd and depression and how much his singing and humour cheers me up. Once I checked it a couple of times and once I hit send the only worry I had was that it wouldn't get printed, mostly I was kind of silly -fan- girling- like- excited that I could have one little connection to someone I admire (if that makes sense).\\nThree weeks later I found out my letter ha\",\n"," \"Hello peoples!

I haven't been officially diagnosed, but the definition of OCD pretty much matches the way my mind works perfectly.  I haven't always been this way, but I started experiencing some disturbing intrusive thoughts almost a year ago, I though I was going insane.  I thought I was losing my mind and was going to become one of those people you see on the news.  The intrusive thoughts are only one thing I have been experiencing since this started.  I have also been experiencing extreme anxiety about my health, every time I feel a pain or ache I immediately think the worst possibility, and with that come really bad anxiety.  My compulsion with that is to immediately go to the doctor or Google it.  The three biggest helps for me right now that I'm doing is Praying/Reading my Bible, spending time with family (Even though some of the disturbing thoughts are about them), and reading this forum.  I'm glad to have found a really active forum, and hope to have many great conversations and learn more about this condition.  I guess I will tell you how or where it started.\\n  All this starts after one day I randomly have a really bad panic attack.

Firstly I'd like to say that I am so glad that I found this site, and thank you for being so supportive and for being such lovely people!\\nLooking back, I think that I probably developed OCD when I was 9 or 10. I had all sorts of crazy rituals, like racing around the kitchen trying to touch all the counter tops before the refrigerator door closed, otherwise something terrible would happen. Unfortunately, I don't think my mom knew not to indulge my reassurance seeking, so I often went to her confessing my thoughts and worries. After some unsuccessful therapy and taking medication for a couple years, OCD left me alone for a while. Now it seems to be back to bully me some more. I'm now a junior in high school, and since I'm facing some pretty big changes next year in addition to regular stress from school, I'm hoping that the OCD will go away once the stress does.

Whether itâ€™s someone referring to the fact they like a tidy desk at work, or someone talking about how grim some festival toilets were, weâ€™ve all heard someone discuss how they can be â€˜a bit OCD about things like thatâ€™.\\nOCD, in this misunderstood form, seems to have become a very popular disorder.

Alternatively, due to the mediaâ€™s insistence as portraying OCD as an addiction to hand-washing and an intolerance of germs, OCD is viewed as an almost positive character trait.

This incident has a lot of questions attached to it. Admittedly I don't see a lot of people inspecting detritus on the ground in the dark night with a pair of chopsticks. I am glad nobody saw me.

Dont give in to it, it doesnt reflect YOU as a person, if you were that person you wouldnt worry about it you would find it pleasant and you certainly wouldnt be on here looking for REASSURANCE. This has helped me from looking up NHS OCD information pages, peoples experiances and many other self help. Its helped me loads.

Too much of OCD is full of negative, here was a negative turned out positive :original:\\nI woke up in a state of panic and dashed out of bed at 5:30am this morning to answer a call of nature. Normally if I woke up at that time I'd roll over and try and sleep, but I knew by the time I got back in to bed, with the alarm going off at 6am, it was pretty pointless. So I got up half an hour early. My OCD was giving me a tough time, but I ignored it and persevered. I stuck my slippers on, trudged my way into the kitchen and got some water. I then picked my keys up off the table, quietly unlocked the back door and sat on the bench outside.\\nOh wow, what a beautiful moment.\\nAs I sipped my water and let the bird's chorus melt away my anxiety, I breathed slowly, deeply. I closed my eyes and just listened, to the fountain, the birds, the Earth just waking up around me. Everyone else was asleep, but that didn't matter. This was my moment here and now. The warm morning sun on my face and the cold water cooling down the burning adrenaline that was running through my brains. There was no more panicking, I couldn't panic, the moment was too precious to panic. I think this will be a moment that lives with me for a long time. Such a simple pleasure, but oh so beneficial.\\nI'm now cracking on with some housework, no surprise I've been so calm I'm on my second lot of laundry and the dishes are done.

I am currently suffering a relapse. I have been off work for nearly 3 months now and am quite housebound. My problems are fear that I will cause harm to others and contamination problems, involving inability to use a loo other than my one at home. I have excessive cleaning routines around using the toilet, which are approximately 1 hour per trip, though that is without all of the gearing up involved, so it effectively takes up around 3 hours a time. When working my checking was excessive, taking up hours of unpaid time. I am seeing an NHS Psychiatrist and they are trying to find a suitable medication.

There is currently no CBT available, due to a lack in trained professionals.\\nI had a severe episode in 2002-2004, where I was eventually hospitalised for 3 weeks and I feel that if I do not improve soon I may be hospitalised again. I am exhausted and depressed. I think about dying every day and I am losing the will to carry on.

And to distract ourselves from worries..... To the greatest extent I find this very true, but, having tried to do this, I have found that it has quite often resulted in bottling everything up and leading to a major depressive/anxious stage.\\nSince this realisation, I have decided to (on occasion), purposefully give in and do exactly what my mind is telling me to do... go to bed and stick my head under pillow and just be gloomy for a bit. Placing a kind of time limit on it though. So, perhaps for an hour or two, allowing myself to be miserable and sleepy, then rising and getting on with it.

Yes, OCD is a torturous and painful anxiety disorder to have. The immense amount of anxiety and hours of painful rumination and/or other compulsion is really horrible. You will not lose your self or sense of reality. You know it is pointless but you will be compelled to do compulsions which is a hell in itself.\\nBut there is a good thing which I realised in last 5 years.\\nBelieve me the most pain of OCD is not due to anxiety caused by obsessions but the hours of repeated fruitless attempt you do to solve or eliminate it. Success needs only one thing to be done, block your compulsions. The other thing is try to be hit by your obsessions more but not do compulsions. Or simply go through the pain of your obsessional anxiety instead of trying to escape it.\\nI know it is not easy thing to be done. Just choose the harder route of not doing the compulsions and having anxiety instead of using the easy road of doing the opposite. Anxiety does not effect with same intensity for a long time, it gets habituated with it. OCD is such a devil that it have it's own brain. At first when you will start to improve, it will try to sabotage your progress by finding tricky logics, convince you to do the opposite to get a quick relief. But if you can stay strong and invite anxiety instead of avoiding them, you are bound to improve.

Dictionary.com had a more familiar definition: “to accumulate for preservation, future use, etc., in a hidden or carefully guarded place.” Both definitions refer to the behavior of creating certainty around an uncertain state.\\nSquirrels hoard acorns to make sure they don’t starve during the winter. Armies hoard weapons to ensure they never run out. And some people with Obsessive Compulsive Disorder (OCD) hoard objects of uncertain value, usually with the belief that the object’s value may be revealed at an important point in the future. A classic example is the OCD sufferer who won’t throw out old newspapers for fear that he may wish to reference an article at a later date. Some people hoard various items of little or no real value for fear that they may need them some day, or fear that they may not be disposing of these items correctly and could cause unwanted consequences.\\nNot all people with OCD hoard.

As posted elsewhere, I stopped driving completely for over 6 months, because I was scared of actually having caused an accident or hit someone, so I would drive around and around the roads I'd taken, then in doing that, I'd create new traces for the OCD to tell me to return to. This happened for hours and hours at a time and was costing a fortune in petrol. I eventually sold the car and bought another, happy that I was now over that obsession.\\nEverything was fine until not very long ago, when after the newness of something has worn off and it becomes normality, the OCD comes back, and it has done badly. I still have the same feelings of having hurt someone and will drive the same route over and over again.

I know that this forum kind of frowns on reassurance seeking and I completely get why.

BUT, I don’t know whether what I’m trying to let pass is something that I shouldn’t. To put a fine point to it. It’s bodily fluids and matter. Urine, faeces and to a lesser extent, mucus and spit. I have these bladder and gastric issues and it resultingly puts me on high alert whenever I use the bathroom. It also makes me fall into a mad panic whenever anything goes near my lap or bum. For example, I have a screen cloth which I used to wipe my tv. As I used it, I carried it past my lap and I think. Did it touch my lap? This itself makes me very uneasy and panic stricken. I don’t want to be self reassuring myself saying that it didn’t touch it didn’t touch because that’s not dealing with the anxiety. The mind can then trick you to telling you that your lap is wet when it might not be etc etc and honestly all I think is WHAT IF it did touch my genital area and I did get some urine on it. Then I think that I have urine all over my screen and I get very sad.

What keeps me going is my 4 yr old. My ocd attacks him but I refuse to ever be scared of being around him because I will hurt him. Even my husband I refuse to act differently because my ocd says maybe u don't love him.\\nWhat I've been doing is trying to keep positive everyday. It's hard trust me. Set goals everyday.

It's about making healthy choices in spite of your difficulties, and having a good therapist to guide your way and together with which to swim and make a little order in the myriad of thoughts we have. And it's about also realising that thoughts are just like clouds in the sky, they come and they go, and we sometimes have better and more enjoyable things to do than focus on them.\\nLife is worth living, after all.\\nI see a lot of people here talking about relapses, changing themes...

I did some last minute shopping today, and was worried I might get falsely accused of shoplifting and I knocked into some guy who was angry with me afterwards, although there wasn't much of a confrontation and a girl who witnessed it told me to take no notice of him. But I am worried about leaving the house now, especially as there have been a few murders recently around the area I live.

Now that my exams have finished I have this prospect of a huge break before I go back to the normality I suppose I have recently said goodbye to. To most people, this would be fantastic, and all of my friends are ecstatic, but I am not.

Last week, my Head of 6th Form told me that I have the opportunity to receive a bursary of £2000 per year of study from a charity. This grant is given to one pupil from every school that is considered to be in need of it and likely to succeed at what they are doing - therefore it is designed to help good students that need financial help.\\nWhen I heard about this award I thought it was a brilliant opportunity for me, but to get it would mean depriving another student.

Loads of you know what my most recent obsession has been, so I won't bore you with that. I am feeling better with it all now and very positive.\\nI had a lapsing moment last week, however, where I decided that it would be a good idea to casually mention my worry to a friend. This was pure reassurance-seeking, as I wanted her to say either that she's had a similar worry in the past or to generally say from the perpective of a woman my own age that I had nothing to worry about. Needless to say, she didn't really get it and pulled a face. So I then spent 2 days thinking 'Oh dear, what if she thinks that something really did happen? That would reflect badly on my boyfriend! Or maybe she will think I have been harmed, which I haven't'. As I had told my friend despite the fact that I knew it might sound bad or she might jump to conclusions (as she doesn't understand obsessions), the confiding only led me to worrying that I was a bad person for chosing to go ahead and tell her anyway. In other words, one obsession moved to another worry.\\nAs a result, I then felt the need to neutralise what I'd said by explaining to her the pattern of my obsessions in more detail, in front of another friend, so she would know that I was the problem and that nothing really had happened.

Unfortunately, my psychiatrist noted that I had OCD, but that the main disorder at work was actually bipolar II. Since she hadn\\'t given me a Y-BOCS because the only OCD symptom I was displaying was excessive hand washing, she ruled out OCD as the primary condition. However, since SSRI\\'s are used as antidepressants as well as OCD medications, the medicine she gave me allowed me to function for the rest of my high school career. I graduated as the salutatorian of my high school and was highly involved with playing the cello. It seemed that my troubles were over.\\nWhen I entered my first year of college, the pressure quickly overwhelmed me. Without a schedule and the constant support of my mom and dad, I would have never been able to survive the beginning of the first semester. However, as I started to get the knack of things, my mood improved, and I was able to finish the se',\n"," \"Hi everyone!\\nJust wanted to share my positive feelings today and hope it inspires you to have an uplifting day.\\nAfter a 4 and a half year break from meds, I went back on them 2 weeks ago and I've been in a dark place, but reading this forum has got me through.

I finally got to see an NHS psychiatrist last week who was brilliant and really understood OCD. I had reservations about telling him some of my thoughts (mainly harm and paedophile) because I know some mental health doctors don't fully understand OCD and the nature of the thoughts people can get. He could tell I didn't want to say, so he said don't worry the thoughts can be about absolutely anything and named paedophile thoughts as an example, which gave me the green light to go ahead and tell him these thoughts without worrying he might think I actually was a danger.

Is it common in other peoples experience to have a lot of thoughts in the subject of harm rather than just one specific thought that repeats?

This belief may be false, an exaggeration or a revulsion - depending on the theme. \\nThe obsession will be  singularly focused  and the unwanted intrusions repetitive.\\nThe thoughts/images appear real because they are processed through the normal channels in the brain - and depending on the theme may induce unwanted physical responses. \\nFor some themes, such as paedophilia, harm, sexual preference, relationship, the OCD core belief is targeting one or more of our true core values - love, care, kindness, faithfulness. And they get turned on their heads - we are made to believe the opposite, causing great distress.\\nWe begin to believe the messages in our mind, and experience a demand for certainty that makes it difficult for us to attribute them to OCD. \\nAnd we respond to the OCD core belief and resultant intrusions by carrying out compulsions to try and make things right and give us relief - but in fact carrying out compulsions gives mean',\n"," 'Hi, all - I\\'ve been in a little depression over the last week since OCD has thrown all its **** at me which made me want to leave the boards.

Although I have been watching it for some time I have only just found the courage to actually post. I have never actually been diagnosed but a while back when mentioning a few of my 'oddities' to a friend (I'd had a couple of glasses of wine so started talking freely!) she mentioned OCD. Like many others I didn't really know what it was but after doing a bit of reading I suddenly realised that maybe I wasn't odd. Most of my thoughts are about those being close to me getting badly hurt or even dying. I just seem to be able to see the absolute danger in everything. For instance when my husband is playing with my children and chucking them about I am convinced he's going to drop them and smash the heads all over the floor. If I haven't heard from my husband in a while I'm convinced he's had a car accident. Fortunately he's cottoned on to this and is quite happy for me to keep phoning him and doesn't think I'm checking up on him for any other reason. I've not actually mentioned OCD to him though. Some of my thoughts make me do/or not do things to prevent things happening. For instance I had to fold my pyjamas very neatly and not eat cheese when my 1st husband was out of the house in case he had a car accident and die. How daft does that sound??!! I know its silly but I still had to do it as I couldn't risk it.

And, well...it all feels a bit anti-climactic to be honest - I wish I hadn't scared myself so much as there was really nothing to worry about! I have felt fine all day and have had no problems. So here are a few pieces of advice I have for anyone thinking of starting medication:\\n1. What you read online is bound to be 'out of the ordinary'. I mean, generally speaking, if you have a very average reaction to something, you are unlikely to feel the need to tell others about it. Whereas if you happen to have an unusually bad reaction, you may write about it online, so as to 'warn' others of the potential dangers. However, that means that what you are reading online does not accurately represent the majority of experiences. So my advice would be to avoid this altogether. Sure it's good to get reassurance, but remember that with anything online, you don't know people's individual circumstances, you don't know their age/reason for taking meds, you may not know what dosage they're on...all of these things can make a person's experience with medication vary. \\n2. Remember, you may well have a load of the side effects from OCD anyway! I mean, think about it: nausea, headaches, fatigue, upset stomach, appetite changes. Sound familiar?

When I was little my family didn't understand what was going on, so they never took me to see a professional about it.

I had obsessive thoughts and rituals which could individually last from numerous hours to numerous days, and I had already lost pretty much all hope I had regarding life.

I just want to share a short story with you guys as it's clear as it is. I bought crystals awhile ago, where I read about crystal therapy and healing with them. Than I read somewhere that we can store thoughts in to the crystals, So I had the belief that crystals are storing thoughts. Then I proceeded to work with the crystals thinking my obsessions, horrible images thoughts etc(So that the crystal will make them go away by storing them) but involuntarily as OCD is good thoughts started to come! But I didn't want good thoughts at that moment because they would be stored in the crystal and gone yet I was bombarded with them.

When we have a question on our mind instead of listening to our brain we should listen to our soul. The soul knows that in the end you're going to regret it, the thoughts will lead you nowhere, where the mind is trying to **** with you and trying to scare you, have faith in your soul, trust it and it will become a habbit.

The moggy, all black with a few single white hairs on it's back, appears to not be older than about two years of age. Everytime someone steps out the front, it approaches. It's very slim and doesn't have a collar. It's been seen and heard all hours of the day and night and it's strongly believed to be a stray. I have contacted the RSPCA who advised I put fresh food and water out for it in case it was hungry, and I put a paper collar on it with a contact number in case it had an owner, but to do no more at this time. That was last night. Sure enough, I've just checked outside and the gorgeous black puss was sat on our pathway- minus the paper collar.\\nIn a moment of hope, I checked the mobile number I provided - nothing. My guess is now that puss has been off hunting for a meal and lost the paper collar while doing so.

I have had many themes over the years, harm, relationship, sexuality etc. A couple of years ago things got really bad for me, looking back I would describe it as a total breakdown. My anxiety started to get out of control and I was no longer able to deal with it and live 'normally' or hide it from people. Quite quickly (within a month or 2) I went from being ok to being the worst I had ever been, I did not know it was possible to feel like this, it started with me obsessing about my sexuality again  but really it just got completely out of control. My brain was on fire, I was barely able to function, and feeling like I would have to end it all. After about 3 or 4 months and multiple psychiatrist/hospital appointments I began to take medication, something I had never done before and was always of the opinion that I was not the type of person who would need medication - how wrong I was, and I was on Lexapro and Xanax. My whole life was a disaster for about 12-14 months.

They rub on my footwear and keep me awake most of the night, such that I catch 1-2 hours good sleep if I'm lucky.\\nI eat only food in fully sealed packaging, off disposable cutlery.I slop out my daily waste as if I was in prison because I cannot sit on a toilet, and last had water on my skin or brushed my teeth in 2002.

However, the harder you work the more you'll get out of it, in the long term. Your goal is too accept the presence of the thoughts. You can't out logic OCD but you can work around it. Let your brain win this fake battle through acceptance. You accept your brain is sending you these irrational (and at times, ****** up) signals. You accept that you cannot stop your brain from sending you these signals. You accept that you cannot control that these signals at times have emotional intensity that make them seem real. You accept that they may hang around for a minute, a day, an hour, a week, etc.\\nThis is what I think acceptance means. Do you really have to accept you could be a child molester, murderer, bad person, etc. I think you have to accept it is possible just like you accept that tonight may be your last night of life should you die in your sleep. You accept it could happen but your ok with that. So you say, maybe I am a [fill in the blank], and go about your day without that thought influencing your decisions.\\nYour job is too live your life despite the perceived legtimacy of the thought your brain is sending you. Here's a pretty easy idea to recognize an OCD thought. If it looks like a duck, quacks like a duck, and walks like a duck it's probably a duck. It could be a chicken but its probably a duck.

We all are in some state of change at any given time, whether we realize it or not. In many treatments for OCD, there is also a constant emphasis upon change. With all this changing or thoughts about changing going on, it would be very easy to overlook something equally important and without which change would not and could not happen. This is something called acceptance.\\nAcceptance means agreeing to something, believing in it, and viewing it as true or real. Accepting something doesn\\'t mean liking it or grudgingly giving in to it. There are many things whose existence we accept that we do not like. OCD is a good example. There are many out there who suffer with the disorder who simply cannot acknowledge or accept that they have it, or that it is really having a very negative impact on their lives.

I thought I'd help some of the newcomers to the forum and describe how I've used acceptance as part of my self-help and how it's helped me.\\nAcceptance in layman's terms is exactly what you'd think, it's accepting the thought. No matter what intrusive thought they may be, be it did I run somebody over, or did I hurt this person, or is this item/ place contaminated; you accept that it could be. 'Perhaps I did run somebody over', 'Maybe I have hurt/ abused someone in the past' and 'Maybe this item/ place is contaminated'.\\nThis is a very powerful tool for a few reasons, OCD often demands us to be certain, to be 100% safe. We then perform all sorts of compulsions to achieve this sense of certainty, which as we know only makes us more uncertain in the long run. Using acceptance completely turns this on it's head and believe me, it will make your anxiety rise to begin with and that's normal.\\nIt's also very effective because OCD also makes us feel extremely responsible, even for things that aren't in our control. Using acceptance removes this excessive role of responsibility and in combination with ERP and not performing compulsions, you will begin to be okay with not being in control and just accepting life for what it is, not what it could be or what it has been.\\nEventually the intrusive thoughts wont hold the same meaning that they used \",\n"," \"Hi guys, hope everyone is doing well today.\\nI thought I'd get some opinions on something I'm currently experiencing, something I haven't encountered before.\\nAbout ten days ago, I experienced a pretty typical moment of OCD.

However, my compulsive side took a new twist 2 weeks ago and I just lost the head. Up to now I've always believed that I wouldn't actually act out any of my compulsions even though I would want to but this time I was caught in the act of doing so. My anger had boiled over and I decided to go ahead and do the deed. I was horrified that I was caught and then couldn't believe that I had tried to commit the act. I felt insane and humiliated. It has taken 2 weeks for the depression to lift (I'm bipolar as well) and I was suicidal for days. I got a lot of help which I think saved me from doing anything stupid.\\nThe point of all this is that in a strange way I feel that by attempting to act out a compulsion and having failed a great weight has been lifted from my mind and I hope that I will never attempt such a crazy thing again. The embarrassment is still there but I'm told that that will fade away. Don't know if this makes any sense to you as I don't want to be specific about the act, I'm too ashamed to talk about it.\\nThanks\\nJellaby\",\n"," \"Hi guys,\\nI wanted to get some opinions on harm OCD and more precisely - acting out upon it. I know the general consensus online is that OCD based intrusive thoughts very rarely (if ever) result in the sufferer actually physically acting them out. Unfortunately, I seem to be an exception. \\nI expect most replies to this thread will be along the lines of 'perhaps you have some other disorder on top of your OCD', but I must insist that I do not believe this is the case for me. The violent impulses, which I've had my entire life, occur in a typicallly OCD style, they are intrusive, they are automatic, they are compulsive, they are not true anger. Moreover, I would describe myself as a deeply good person.\\nNevertheless, I find myself increasingly acting upon them. For example, if I were to bang my elbow slightly on a door, even if it didn't actually hurt, I would feel an almost inescapable need to strike it back. It's almost like an obligation. Even if I can't be bothered, I do it. It's as if I'm put on auto pilot momentarily. Sometimes there isn't even a trigger, sometimes I simply just do it, almost as if I'm testing myself, like I don't trust myself. And when I lose control - I'm not myself.\\nThe impulses to strike out overwhelm me and it tends to result in my body physically and automatically complying, rather than a calculated and planned effort to do so. It's like violence is in my mind, presumably because of my OCD intrusive thoughts, and my body complies accordingly.\\nIt's jus\",\n"," \"Although I am in the northern hemisphere and therefore heading for the long cold months, this problem is of course universal and our friends in the southern hemisphere also have to face it.\\n\\nThis is the first time I have faced this period as a retiree with no work; and as I am currently in therapy seeking some more answers to my own current problems of OCD dysfunctional thinking and negative automatic thoughts I haven't had the inclination or the health to want to take on part-time voluntary work. although of course I can see that is one solution, as indeed it is for the splendid voluntary workers who keep OCD-UK going, for example.\\n\\nThose of you in work and busy will probably manage ok, others we need to find focuses to distract from the OCD.\\n\\nSo what are we all planning to do?

I would have to stop walking to school to step on a leaf. I also had a prayer that I had to say every night, then 5x per night then up to 500. \\n  Because I used to have to 'start fresh' I took many books out of the teachers' cupboard and then took my old books home.

Because I have a very disabling (when untreated) case of ADHD Primarily Inattentive Type, I don't want to reduce my dopamine or norepinephrine levels further.

I know it isn't a 'quick fix' and the likelihood is I'll be on them for a while - but I don't want to be on them forever...\\ni know ultimately it's my decision and it's best to discuss this type of thing with my GP - but just want to get other people's opinions to see what their knowledge/opinion/personal experience of using medication to help in the treatment of OCD is..?\\nthanks in advance \",\n"," 'Hi Guys,\\nI haven’t really posted on one of these before so I apologise if I’ve got the wrong idea.\\nI am currently undergoing therapy for OCD, and whilst I have managed to get control over my compulsive resetting behaviour, I still have these horrible intrusive thoughts about my girlfriend with another man. I know I shouldn’t be embarrassed by it but I’m kinda terrified to speak to my therapist about it as I find it humiliating and I was wondering if anybody has been in a similar situation and could help me? \\n  Thanks in Advance x\\nEdited March 27, 2020 by NinjaSloth27',\n"," 'So since I had a bad relapse in September I have noticed my OCD spikes about 7+ days before my period.

I'll try to keep this brief and i'll not add everything, just enough to try and describe things, but sometime i can ramble on.\\nI believe i may have some form of OCD / BDD but i'm not sure whether i should maybe speak to a GP or if it's maybe jusy low confidence and a lack of self esteem.\\nI guess it started when i was at college, well that was when it semed more noticeable and worsening. I tended to have an intense dislike for my appearence and maybe that can be normal when you're a teen but it felt very severe and was something that i thought about almost every hour of the day to that i had low confidence and very low esteem.... to the point where it is hard to concentrate on anything else (i've noticed i have really poor concentration levels )..... anyway although i did have friends at college and i did have some good times, i'd say my social life was poor, practically no chance of forming relationships and i had feelings of anxiety - especially walking past people.... i had this stupid habit of always wearing a cap..... and i'd walk with my face towards the floor when walking past others - i guess it helped avoid eye contact and i think it was a way of trying to hide a little. The hat thing became a standing joke with my friends, it's occasionally mentioned even these days!.\\nWell after that i went to University, i never actually wanted to go really but the reason\",\n"," \"Hi everyone,\\nJust wondered if I could get some imput on a few things:\\n1. I have to contact my GP tomorrow regarding my progress over the last week.

On the one hand I have reduced handwashing in some situations from 55 times to 12. On the other hand, I could never imagine being able to touch or even contemplate touching anything alcohol-related or a million other contamination issues that I have (even just around the house).\\nI just don't know what I think or if I really care all that much to be honest. I'd much rather not deal with this at all ... just want to be left alone and not have to try so hard or think so much.\\n2. I have an appointment with an agency tomorrow to organise some temping work for the rest of my summer (I've just qualified as a lawyer but don't start practising until the start of October). The only reason I've even done this is because I'm feeling incredibly guilty about not working and being around the house all the time. Its really just to please my parents. The thought of having to work in an office and deal with all the OCD stuff that that entails just makes me want to run a mile. Its not that I'm lazy, I just feel numb and uninterested.\\nAdded to this is the fact that I'm really unsure about my whol\",\n"," \"I feel strange posting on here to a bunch of people i don't even know..

Only recently have people started saying things to me about the scars and marks, and it makes me uncomfortable and makes me want to withdraw and cover up even more..\\nI'm not sure whether i should just ignore it and just get on with it by myself..

At the moment, im suffering with it and i now really want 2 seek help, i want 2 try and control it on my own but this doesnt last long i do say 2 myself \"\"the more i ignore it the more i control it and the more i do this the stronger i will become\"\" but that doesnt last long it always finds a away of getting in2 me. I have got the book on brain lock but 2 be honest i dont think a book is gonna help me somehow. Maybe i should go and see a therapist? like try CBT or something? im kinda nervous about going to my doctor and telling them i have OCD cos i dont think most of them will know what that is? i could try being more stronger and determind 2 beat the OCD by myself and i would love 2 achieve this.
