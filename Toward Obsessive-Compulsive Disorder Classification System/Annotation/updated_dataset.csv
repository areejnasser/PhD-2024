0,"I grew up with obsessive thoughts, or more aptly, intrusive thoughts. I believed they were a reflection of who I am, but recently I have learned the very opposite. They are exactly who I am not. It is not real. There is a dark honesty about the next few paragraphs, but I feel it needs to be told.
My intrusive thoughts (intrusions) have always been violent. From as young as 4, I remember thinking about death. A little older, about killing, rape, murder. Under the age of 10, I would constantly be haunted by thoughts of torturing people around me. Inappropriate acts of violence. And even though I didn’t understand it, acts of sexual violence. These thoughts came in fast and in succession. They become constant, repulsive, extremely distressing. When I was little, I recognised intrusions as bad thoughts. I knew I shouldn’t be having them but I didn’t know how to communicate them to others. They could be so frightening, it almost felt like my own mind was blackmailing me. To make matters worse, obsessive thoughts ugly brother, consequence stepped in. Consequence took my compulsions and mixed them up with my obsessions. It reared its head in the voice that speaks, “If you don’t match all of the spoons up together, your mum will die today”. “If don’t you cross your toes when your legs are crossed, you will crash your car into those school children.” “If you don’t wash your hands 3 times in the 12 step process, your house will be robbed while you are at work”.",grew obsessive thoughts aptly intrusive thoughts believed reflection recently learned opposite exactly real dark honesty next paragraphs feel needs told intrusive thoughts intrusions always violent young 4 remember thinking death little older killing rape murder age 10 would constantly haunted thoughts torturing people around Inappropriate acts violence even though understand acts sexual violence thoughts came fast succession become constant repulsive extremely distressing little recognised intrusions bad thoughts knew know communicate others could frightening almost felt like mind blackmailing make matters worse obsessive thoughts ugly brother consequence stepped Consequence took compulsions mixed obsessions reared head voice speaks match spoons together mum die today cross toes legs crossed crash car school children wash hands 3 times 12 step process house robbed work,"['site', 'thinking', 'killing', 'compulsion', 'obsession', 'voice', 'rash', 'use', 'violence', 'communication', 'intrusive thought', 'process', 'thinking']",,,,
1,"I have been thinking so much about Covid because it’s part of my job and well, who isn’t, right? The concern for me was about all the encouraged hand washing and OCD. Would that scratch that OCD itch in my brain? I got tired real quick about singing ‘happy birthday’ while washing my hands and it became clear to me that this is like life in that we can’t be perfect and striving to perfectly eliminate all risk is just not gonna happen, and increase anxiety. I have fear of contamination and that might get worse with Covid-19. I have to manage my thought I know it is irrational and I am cleaned but do it for revealing.

2,"I’ve noticed that I’ve been washing my hands more lately, that things are triggering a need to wash my hands and that I’m giving in to those triggers more often. This scares me. I need to be careful and work on not giving in. But like today I washed my hands quite a few times that I probably didn’t really need to. But it really felt like I needed to in that moment. And just going ahead and washing seemed easier than waiting out the need.
I’ve been having such a difficult time lately with depression. Therapy is so hard. But I’ve been holding on to all the progress I made in OCD therapy, and that helps me keep working on depression stuff in therapy. I keep remind myself that I got better, that I got control of OCD. OCD is irrational.  Hopefully I get better soon.

3,"I just don't get whats wrong. I'm getting so much worse. I was in my room from 2-7pm today tapping with no break. I can't stop crying I'm sooooo scares. I know you can't help me but, well, I don't know - I may as well ask? It’s the part that I’ve just indulged somewhat and potentially has become worse over the years. I struggle to feel safe, comfortable if I’m not sure something is done, such as locking the door. There is no reason for why I feel the need to check all the time  I know there is no need, it is unrealistic thought feel terrified of the consequences or visions of which pass my mind. I have never forgot anything before but these thoughts that I have devour my mind. I will check and check and check but I will still question it. To help reassure myself on this I take a picture and clap (or memorable action). I feel like I am in the same circle.",get wrong getting much worse room 2 7pm today tapping break cannot stop crying sooooo scares know cannot help well know may well ask part indulged somewhat potentially become worse years struggle feel safe comfortable sure something done locking door reason feel need check time know need unrealistic thought feel terrified consequences visions pass mind never forgot anything thoughts devour mind check check check still question help reassure take picture clap memorable action feel like circle,"['crying', 'thinking']",,,,

Obsessive Compulsive Disorder, otherwise known as OCD is far more extensive than a malady of someone that flicks the odd light switch 3 times in a row, or thinks they’ve left their straighteners on, when in fact they haven’t. It is reflective of complete panic, anxiety and guilt which affects every aspect of life for those who suffer from it.
OCD has always been part of my life, since I can remember. It isn’t something I talk about often, due to the lack of knowledge on the audience part. But as I get older, the harder it is to cope with my OCD “ticks”, “rituals” and “repetition”.
No one really knows the depths of my disorder, but friends and family like to speculate and analyze a situation that has occurred where I have freaked out when my food Is touching each other on my plate, or I’ve had to leave a do early to go check if my straighteners are on or they see me sitting down and then getting back up 5 times in a row.
From as far back as I can remember, OCD has played a vital role in my life. I’ve always been very sporty, adventurous and sociable, however, even talking to someone can cause stress which is so overwhelming. Friends and family always laugh and say “It’s a Courtney moment”, “We love you the way you are, warts and all”.
Even in my early teenage years, my mom had to force me to walk on the cracks in the pavement, reassuring me that I won’t die if I stand on a line, or that an family member won’t get severely ill if I walk on equal number of pavement s",JokesASide Obsessive Compulsive Disorder otherwise known OCD far extensive malady someone flicks odd light switch 3 times row thinks left straighteners fact reflective complete panic anxiety guilt affects every aspect life suffer OCD always part life since remember something talk often due lack knowledge audience part get older harder cope OCD ticks rituals repetition one really knows depths disorder friends family like speculate analyze situation occurred freaked food touching plate leave early go check straighteners see sitting getting back 5 times row far back remember OCD played vital role life always sporty adventurous sociable however even talking someone cause stress overwhelming Friends family always laugh say Courtney moment love way warts Even early teenage years mom force walk cracks pavement reassuring die stand line family member get severely ill walk equal number pavement,"['anxiety disorder', 'panic', 'anxiety', 'anxiety', 'anxiety', 'guilt', 'guilt', 'touching', 'role', 'talking', 'use', 'love', 'disorder']",,,,
