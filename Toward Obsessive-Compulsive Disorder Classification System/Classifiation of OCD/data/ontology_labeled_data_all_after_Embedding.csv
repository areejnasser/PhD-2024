"January of this year I was let go from my job. My OCD had spiked and I was calling out sick for weeks. They were kind enough and felt bad I was so """"""""sick"""""""" that laid me off so I could collect unemployment and keep my insurance benefits. My unemployment runs out next week.
I am doing much better now and though the prospect of going back to work scares me I do not have an option. My big concern is explaining the gap in my work history. It is not as though I can say, Hi, I have a mental illness and had a nervous breakdown.
I am also concerned because I have talk therapy once to twice a week to deal with my depression and PTSD, and I am supposed to be starting CBT soon. I am not sure how I would go about getting the time needed for these very important things.
Does anyone have any advice to offer??
Thanks so much in advance!!

"Hello everyone
We've had my two-year-old niece with us for most of this week and she's actually been really good for me because she's kept me busy and active and I think might have helped me confront some of my thoughts.
However, right now, I'm a little bit frightened. I've been going through a thing for some time when I would keep checking all the switches in our hallway. Some of them don't 'go' anywhere, they're just stray switches but then because they don't do anything, that seemed to stress me out even more in case I started a fire somewhere secret. But more than that, I'm afraid I might have been checking for them for the sake of checking.
The truth is, I feel really upset and feel I'm setting too much store by my OCD right now, making myself sick and dizzy and hot by checking the switches night after night and I think I might have done it just because. I finally hit rock-bottom last night - there's one switch in particular that doesn't 'do anything', right next to the bathroom one. Both of them are outside the bathroom door. I keep checking both switches - even though it's obvious they're both turned off - and I keep checking and checking, counting to and fro in my head. I also get paranoid still about getting water on switches. Unfortunately, all this backwards and forwards kept making me want to go to the bathroom, which is a problem because it turns into a vicious circle.
I got into a state last night and told my dad everything and he told me to 'rationalise' and not check the switches. So now I'm not.
And this is the daft thing - but I feel really scared. I'm scared because I'm not doing it and I'm scared the game is finally up for me - that the whole world has done what it can for me and there's no more help I can be given. I'm scared because doing the rituals seem to have become part of me. I'm scared because I fear a kind of 'arrogance' taking me over and I'm scared of how I feel in case I sabotage my own chances of recovery - something I really fear doing.
I feel I need a distraction, but I'm not sure what. I'm just so scared of myself.

"Hello everyone
Feeling a bit down at the moment (yeah, I know *facepalm*) My parents have dropped me back off at my student housing for the night and I'm the only one here, which I wasn't really expecting. I've just been feeling a little afraid, and worried I won't be able to trust myself, especially as my parents were quite keen on me coming back with them, and took a fair bit of persuasion to let me stay, because I was in desperate need of some space.
... On the plus side, I'm keeping myself busy! Anyone fancy a singalong to the Dennis the Menace theme tune?",['drop'],['theme'],"['drop', 'theme']",1.0,,0,0,
"I wanted to share with you this little illustration of why reassurance seeing doesn't work... I guess it might help someone, feel free to skip though as it's quite boring
so anyway, a few months ago I had an explosion of ocd, which prompted me to join this forum. It was by far the worst experience of ocd I've ever had, if not any kind of experience. I had this worry that I was going to be arrested for something that happened many years ago. I wanted - needed - certainty. I was absolutely desperate. It was the lowest I've ever been and I ended up in a pretty dark place.
Anyway I like to think I'm quite a rational minded person, so I wanted to look at the scientific odds of this happening. I'd read a self help book once that said this was a good way of reducing your worry.
I made a list of eight things that would have to happen in order for my worries to come true, and then gave an honest percentage to each event in terms of how likely they were to happen. My estimate was pretty generous as I was by this point quite convinced. I then multiplied them together and came out with a one in 300,000 chance of my worry coming true. I couldn't argue with maths: this was the truth.
So for a couple of days I had a spring in my step, feeling like the world had been lifted. """"""""this reassurance DOES work"""""""" I told myself.
But then the doubt crept in. My brain wrapped itself round that one chance, even though it was one in three hundred thousand, at best. That """"""""one"""""""" loomed large in my mind. It wasn't good enough. I started panicking, googling, asking, researching, ruminating, i felt sick all the time, I felt I couldn't go on and my life was over... in short I got stuck on the ocd roundabout and couldn't get off.
So even though I was quite satisfied that the odds were infinitely small - much smaller than the chances of a car crash, getting cancer, having a heart attack etc (none of which worried me at all) - I was OBSESSED with this because I kept feeding the fire by carrying out my rituals.
So I guess the point I wanted to get across is that... the reassurance seeking/researching never ever ever ever ever works because even if there's only one chance in three hundred thousand, or in a billion, ocd will still latch onto it. The ONLY way to move past it is to say """"""""ok, whatever, maybe that will happen, I can't read the future"""""""" and get on with life.
I hope this doesn't seem at all condescending or preachy - that's not how I mean it at all, cos I still massively struggle with this! - it just really struck me as quite a stark illustration of how reassurance never works, no matter how tempting it is. So if anyone is reading this, desperate for certainty on a particular issue, please stop, you'll never get certainty - you don't need it! it's just ocd. Forget him and his bullying ways. just get on and enjoy your day xx","['rash', 'Rituals', 'hope', 'Bullying', 'joy', 'OCD']",['Rituals'],"['OCD', 'Bullying', 'rash', 'Rituals', 'joy', 'hope']",,1.0,0,1,"I had an explosion of ocd/  I started panicking, googling, asking, researching, ruminating, i felt sick all the time, I felt I couldn't go on and my life was over. /  I was OBSESSED with this because I kept feeding the fire by carrying out my rituals.

"So, I just admitted that I might have PTSD and BPD, apart from OCD, which I admitted I have last summer, finally, after being in denail about it for half a year. Plus social anxiety and insomnia. And depression and anger issues.
So I think it's not really about getting rid of OCD, or getting read of PTSD, it's about getting a better mental health and having a greater quality of life overall. It's about making healthy choices in spite of your difficulties, and having a good therapist to guide your way and together with which to swim and make a little order in the myriad of thoughts we have. And it's about also realising that thoughts are just like clouds in the sky, they come and they go, and we sometimes have better and more enjoyable things to do than focus on them.
Life is worth living, after all.
I see a lot of people here talking about relapses, changing themes... I wanted to put this idea out here.
Three years ago my goal was to lose weight. I did everthing I could in order to achieve it, and I did. After I did it, I started being lazy, I stopped exercising and eating healthy, and here I am, three years later, 40 pounds overweight.
Nobody expects to stay in great shape if they stop exercising and stop eating healthy. So why is it that some would expect to stop doing what's healthy for them mentally and have great mental health?
The brain is a muscle, and as any muscle we have, if we stop training it it gets soggy.
When we develop OCD is an alarm signal to start doing those healthy things which we know are healthy for us. But really, everyone could benefit from training their brains: through meditation, mindfulness, exercising, eating healthy, learning when it is worthy to worry and when it is not...
We are not our OCD, BPD, PTSD and the key to recovery is to make recovery from OCD a byproduct of the healthy lifestyle choices you make: act according to your values, in spite of your fears, do the things you wanna do, work towards your goals, cultivate your passions, and others.
That's what I believe is the key not only to recovery from OCD for good, but olso to build a more happier, meaningul life.
I, for one, now that I admitted that I might also have these other two mental disorders, apart from the three I knew I had, I am determined to change. I am determined to work hard towards recovering from PTSD and BPD and OCD and develop the mental tools which will help me further along in my journey through life, to put all these mental health issues behind.
I encourage you all to have faith in yourself, in your ability to change and in your ability to make life as you want it.

this time last year i was sleeping for 3 hours in a 24 hr period and that was in my car - i was also spending 19 hours a day in checking rituals , was covered in self harm scars across my arms head and chest and was praying that i could die
but i am 1000000000% better now, and i am just writing this to encourage you gus that no matter how u feel now , - it wont always feel this bad - i promise
i have had ocd for 31 years and it was so severe , so you have to believe me that we can all get better and through this together
ironically it was me falling over and breaking my leg ankle and wrist that helped me get over my ocd - because all of a sudden i could do nothing - so i had to rest and as i got some sleep my perspective got clearer and i got better
i dont necessarily recommend breaking bones :lol:, but sometimes the worst life changes can turn out to be blessings in disguise

"Today I had one of the worst OCD Days ever, but it turned out quite well.
We have a god awful wedding this Saturday (two people we have never met but know their parents and are """"""""slightly"""""""" related to them). I didn't have anything to wear, so two weeks ago I ordered something online, only when it got here last Friday it didn't fit. It was too late to get something else online, so I had to go shopping (something I hate), in Inverness, where I found nothing, then Aberdeen, where I found nothing. Today we decided to drive down to Edinburgh. Apart from the stress and poor John having to listen to me scream at him to watch where he stood for the 100th time, we were almost home when John said he needed to use the loo. I needed to go too, but was wary. We went into John Lewis, thinking it would be clean, and when I went in the stall I thought """"""""that's one clean loo"""""""". I sat down (making a mental note to shower when I got home). I'd just finished when I saw it. There was a match on the floor in the corner. It was not a place you'd have stood, but whomever had used the loo before me had put it there, making the whole bathroom contaminated, including the seat I was sitting on, and the paper I'd have to use.
I lost it big style. I started screaming crying. I finished my business, washed my hands, then realised there was no point as I was totally exposed (because the contamination was *inside* me). I ran out and stood in the middle of the shop crying. poor John came over and I screamed at him to get away from me. We left to go to the car and I cryed my way through the shopping centre. He had to go down the stairs and I the lift because I didn't want him so close to me.
At the car I lost it again. We got in, and I told him not to touch me, not even by accident. It was a two and a half hour minimum journey home and I couldn't stop crying. Once out of the centre and on the road the worst moment came. I couldn't stop visualising it in my mind on the floor, and i started to cry again. I wiped my eyes, not thinking that my hands felt contaminated, and Then I realised that because the blood vessles are thin in your eyes that the """"""""germs"""""""" would not only be *inside* my lower areas, but they were now in my bloodstream. I had to tilt my head back to cry so the tears wouldn't go down my face and near my mouth as they were contaminated, and I didn't want them in my mouth.
Then something happened that changed everything. A One and a half hour traffic jam.
In a car, totally at the end of my thether and feeling like I wanted to die (i kept asking poor John just to kill me to put me out of my misery). The third worst possible contamination (touching one would be worst, followed by touching someone who has them on their person), but just as stressful as having touched one, I realised I hadn't died. The chemicals hadn't made me combust. I was still breathing, not sick, not dying. I was paniced, yes, but apart from that I could breathe, I could talk, i could move, and most importantly the world didn't come to an end.
By the end ot the Jam, I was at a kind of a strange *peace* with it. I even kissed john, without fear of him being hurt because I was contaminated. I realised I was sitting in the car doing mental rituals to stop the stress, then I thought """"""""well, the didn't stop you getting contaminated in the first place, so why do them now?"""""""". I tried not to do them, though they kept creeping back almost subconciously. When they would I stopped as soon as I realised, and nothing bad happened when I did.
So I had a wee victory. I must admit, when I got in did have a shower, but it was half as long as it normally is. I also don't plan on decontaminating the car (at least at the moment, although I still want to). I do keep gettign these weird *spasms* where i sort of stop breathing, them my body spasms to start it again, but they don't really hurt (they are a bit scary). I think at the moment I'm running on 90% adrenaline, 5% faith and 5% love (becaue John got me through it). I don't know where to go from here, but at least to day I won for once!

"This morning I made a resolution to try not post asking for reassurance.  So, here's today's positives so far:
1. Had blood test - came home and resisted washing hands for about half an hour until I needed to go to the loo and had to wash them.
2. On Christmas Day I dropped an earring on the bedroom floor, picked it up and put it on the side waiting until I felt ready to wash it.

I have had OCD for about7 months. I am feeling pretty good at the moment. I am on medication and having CBT therapy. I think my therapist is good and i have made quite a lot of improvements since i started therapy. However, there are still some behaviours e.g. handwashing, avoiding things touched by others that i am finding it hard to let go of. My therapist has suggested that i try to 'go for it' and try to not do any of my behavioural rituals AT ALL to really try and make a big jump forward. I am just worried that if I try this, i will become really depressed and stressed again. I really dont want to go back to feeling terrible because i am so happy to be feeling better and don't want to go back to feeling bad again.
I was wondering if anyone has been though this sort of therapy and how long it took you to feel ok again once you started the intensive behavioural work? It would be nice to know that there is light at the end of the tunnel before i go in!!!

I am so tired, upset, lonely and just wish this nightmare would end so I can have a normal life!
I suffer from Int thoughts, perfection, ruminations, symetry etc.
Cutting a long story short, went to see a CMH Team nurse xmas time, he said I had OCD and depression. Therapy did'nt go well as was so rushed etc. I am now seeing a lady whose approach is very good, but her CBT way is to challenge, which seems to aggrivate things.
Asked doc if it was defo ocd she said she did'nt know (which worried me even more).
Things have been much worse since my mum had to go into a nursing home last Sept and I now live alone. (Miss her very much)
I am always worrying something will pop in my head, panic if I dont panic (hope that makes sense), feel I don't know what technique to use, always feel I should be working out why these thoughts occured etc etc. It seems like certain thoughts go with certain situations, more anxious I feel worse it gets.
I just dont want things like this anymore, I am so sick of it! It would be nice to know whats waht and get moving in the right direction.

"i do not post here very often i know, but i feel that i have to share with other people because i cannot stop obsesssing over something that happened today.
if you can picture the scene, i got on a bus with my 6 year old son and 2 heavy shopping bags and a back-pack, the bus was fairly busy, we sat down in 2 single seats that were next eachother and put my bags between them, as the bus filled up a man who was drunk? got on and sat at the back, the bus was stopped in traffic and he began shoting at everyone who was sat at the front of the bus saying that they couldnt sit there as they """"""""were not elderly or disabled"""""""", he was really aggressive - there was one person having to stand up on the bus (who i wouldnt describe as elderley or disabled). the aggressive man moved further down the bus and had a go at 2 middle aged ladys calling them """"""""ugly slags"""""""" an elderly lady told him not to speak to them like that - it was all really stressfull.
i feel very bad about the whole thing, i always offer my seat to elderly or disabled or pregnant woman - but i feel this persons outburst was directed at me personally - it hasnt helped that i have had a bad day with my obssesssions and rituals.
this whole incident is going round my head like """""""" was i right to sit down, should i have made myself and my child stand up?"""""""", the other people on the bus were calling this bloke a """"""""big mouth"""""""" and telling him to shut up, should i have said something?, should i have contributed? would that have been suitable behaivour of me?.
the sign reads """"""""seating for elderly, disable or those with children"""""""" so i was justified as i had my son with me?, or should i have got up and let my son sit next to a stranger which he wouldnt feel comfortable with?

"I've not posted for a while, mostly because I've been feeling down, but hey - it was my birthday yesterday and I managed to feel somewhat upbeat which was good.
Anyway, this morning I had a thought, a rationalisation if you like about my fears that put a few things into perspective. I still doubt it, but I guess that's the nature of these things.
Basically, if I am what I fear:-
* why would I be worried about feeling attraction to what I fear - if I was what I fear, I wouldn't be worried about it
* I wouldn't have what has become almost a phobia of young girls - I'd be getting enjoyment out of it
* I wouldn't have spent the past two months testing and checking, because I'd already know the answer
* whenever I see young girls I would hardly be feeling a mixture of fear and almost an urge to throw up!
* I wouldn't be panicking about going on holiday next week where there's going to be loads of them
I've noticed also that it's worse in a morning - there seems to be a lot more 'background' anxiety which makes it seem like I'm much more on edge - this seems to subside by around midday after which I feel a lot better.
I've also gotten the ruminations right down to a lot less than what they were a few weeks ago. This seems to have increased the intensity of some of the spikes (both visual, i.e. seeing a young girl, and mental, i.e. a 'what if' situation), but I don't seem to be dwelling on them too much. My mind now likes to throw me curve balls such as 'what if it was legal' - but I've recognised that the immediate increase in anxiety following these thoughts tells me that once again, my brain is trying to kick my head in...
There's still so many unanswered questions - things such as 'why are you worrying about this in the first place - there must be something to it', but I've started to accept that that's the way it works.

"Hi all,
I posted a few weeks back as my anxiety/OCD arrived back into my life in all it's glory about 5 weeks ago. It basically started with a menigitus spike at work ( I am a student nurse). I've been basically battling these ever changing thoughts and physical sensations ever since. It started off with headaches, palpitations and all over body shakes, which were caused by non stop thoughts of meningitus, death and germs. I battled through using the four steps and still managed to go to work, exposing myself to my fear.
Once these thoughts were under control then I started to get difficulty swallowing; thinking my throat was going to close and also I was going to choke on my food. I've been drinking water like it's going out of fashion and chomping on polos like a woman possessed, as they are the only things that help! Then when I'm not worrying about my swallowing my breathing starts to be my focus.
I went to go and see the doctor and was ready to take the plunge and confess almost all of my OCD, but the doctor I saw was an old locum, who just about managed to give me some beta blockers for the palpitations and didn't seem interested when I said I'd had anxiety and postnatal issues in the past. I'm going back to the doc's tomorrow and I'm hoping to see someone sympathetic and get this sorted. I'm seeing a Cognitive Hypnotherapist today, as recommended by a friend. I know it won't cure the OCD but I'm hoping it will calm my bodily reactions down a bit! I've also told the uni I'm suffering from Panic attacks and I'm waiting to hear back from their conselling service. I've also heard that I might be able to get CBT free, through Occupational health so I'm going to give that a whirl as well. I've spent so many years of my life holding this all in and dealing with it on my own and now I am really starting to realise this is bigger than me and if their is help out there I'm taking it, which is a monumental step for me.

"Hi again,
I am fairly confident that I am suffering with pure-O along the harm theme. One thing I wanted to ask about though was whether it is common for the theme to be quite broad? So in my case I do not just have one thought i.e. what if I stab someone that repeats over and over again. I tend to have a lot of different thoughts ranging from images of harming someone when walking in the street to specific fears which have evolved from a horrible news story I read that do repeat somewhat. Is it common in other peoples experience to have a lot of thoughts in the subject of harm rather than just one specific thought that repeats? I am just trying to get a little information as I have seen it said often that people fear harming someone but it doesn't say that the theme can be broad reaching and throw up all sorts of horrible thoughts around hurting people.","['fear', 'Thought']",['theme'],"['fear', 'Thought', 'theme']",1.0,,1,0,I am fairly confident that I am suffering with pure-O along the harm theme.
"Hello all
I've posted a few words of advise to various contributors over the last couple of weeks - and finally summoned up the nerve to ask for some help myself.
I'm a long-time OCD sufferer - usually in bouts of 1-2 years, almost always Pure-O.
I'm currently working through a structured CBT programme with a great therapist - a mixture of Cognitive therapy to challenge my thinking patterns (excellent) and some exposure work (my current topic of choice is a doubt about my sexuality. I'm straight but currently worry that I'm not
My exposure isn't very hard to do - confront images/situations that prompt the fears/thoughts or 'spikes'. However, I find myself constantly checking and what my therapist calls both 'hypervigilant (always alert to possible triggers) and attentionally biased (now liable to notice men more than I did before this worry started).
My therapist tells me to pay 'minimal attention' when out and about. He's also talked about using a 'Pre-OCD me' approach (effectively behave how you always did, even if it now feels deliberate rather than natural).
My dilemma is that I now worry that not checking (looking to be sure, gauge my reaction etc) is avoidance - and therefore reinforcing.
Does anyone with P.OCD or H.OCD have any similar dilemmas, experiences, views etc?","['fear', 'Thought', 'checking', 'OCD']",['spike'],"['fear', 'Thought', 'checking', 'spike', 'OCD']",1.0,,1,0," almost always Pure-O.

"Hi.
I have compulsive thoughts or ruminations as well as actions and I was wondering how I should use the four steps for them. A lot of my thoughts or ruminations involve me having to think of something perfectly and I cant do anything before I have done that.

For example, a past fear of mine is that I’ve had sex with someone while drunk and forgot. There is literally no way for me to get back nights that I can’t remember, so I truly have to live with that. Through a lot of therapy, I finally understood that.
But, I have another fear that I cheated on my SO with an ex. Google and Facebook track your steps (literally everywhere and for how long), and theoretically, I could login and check my location history. It’s all there. So, the uncertainty isn’t really there - the answers exist somewhere. I don’t know how to live with the uncertainty since I can find out something with just a click. Is that OCD in this case? I’m afraid I’m going to log on and see my little location dot at my ex’s house overnight or something. I can’t tell if that’s just hiding a fact from myself or OCD. Any assistance?

"Hi all,
Just thought I'd share my night with you.
I went to a friends 30th birthday party tonight. Decided to drive, so no drinkies for me. I was a bit worried at first, as alcohol of course relaxes me so that my OCD is at a manageable level.
I only had one spike at the end of the night (even though there were loads of kids there!) which was after a very drunken girl (who it turns out that I knew) crashed the party. She was harmless- just having a good boogie to the live band. I was asking my friend about her, then after we left, I started to worry that she had somehow overheard what I'd been saying. Hubby has assured me she was a good 20 feet away (and the band were still playing) so there was no chance that she'd heard me.
All in all, a good night methinks- I even got up and had a dance (albeit an old mum dance, lol) with zero alcohol inside me. Feeling pretty good","['Thought', 'OCD', 'rash']",['spike'],"['rash', 'Thought', 'spike', 'OCD']",1.0,,1,0,"my OCD is at a manageable level.

"Hi,
In the past I have gone though medications and REBT (Rational Emotive Behaviour Therapy). REBT did help very well, but its focus is more towards the cognitive part of the OCD. Recently a technique came to my mind as follows:
Imagine the cycle of Pure O is like two threads
1- First thread is that of intrusive thought that comes as a spike.
2- Second thread is that of the worry, anxiety and fear that is caused which results in mental rumination
If the entire focus is taken off from stopping the intrusive thought, reasoning with it or replying to it and put onto reducing the worry and anxiety, you make quick progress. It requires some mental discipline and focus, but it works very well.
MOTTO: Don't control the thought, cotrol the anxeity, worry and frustration.
I look forward to your comments and feedback on this. Is this MOTTO correct. To be honest, I am myself doing a bit of reassurance seeking over here, but I hope this would result in positive change.","['Medication', 'OCD', 'fear', 'hope', 'anxiety', 'anxiety', 'Thought']","['intrusive thought', 'rumination', 'spike']","['rumination', 'anxiety', 'OCD', 'fear', 'Thought', 'intrusive thought', 'spike', 'Medication', 'hope']",1.0,,1,0,"First thread is that of intrusive thought that comes as a spike.

"A few hours ago, I was carrying a box upstairs for my mom. The box wasn't particularly heavy, it was just large. Anyway, my mom has those double doors that open up to her room. Only one of them was open, but I was so focused on getting everything upstairs in one piece that I failed to notice it. Long story short, I bumped into the door. :blushing: I was slightly stunned, and I just stopped for a second. """"""""You're human, just turn the box sideways!"""""""", said my mom with a patronizing tone. I gave her the box and walked away feeling rather guilty.

"It's been a long time since I posted and many of the people currently using the forum won't have a clue who I am, so I shall begin with a brief background summary. Those who know my situation may prefer to skip down to today's achievement in capital letters!
I have been completely housebound by my ocd since October 2004. I have severe contaminated OCD and live on some plastic sheets on the floor of one room in an unfurnished house. I wear 3 pairs of sterile surgical gloves to touch any surface outside of my plastic sheeting 'safe' area. Once I'm up and out of my safe area for the day (a ritual that has been taking 3-4 hours a time for the last two or more years), I have to stand all day until I am ready to get my gloves off and go back to 'bed', (another 3-4 hour ritual).As a result I stand without a break for 16 hours a day (sometimes 36 hours at a stretch)and in the last 6 years I have developed very paiful leg ulcers which now extend from lower calf on one leg, to the sole of the foot on the other leg. They rub on my footwear and keep me awake most of the night, such that I catch 1-2 hours good sleep if I'm lucky.
I eat only food in fully sealed packaging, off disposable cutlery.I slop out my daily waste as if I was in prison because I cannot sit on a toilet, and last had water on my skin or brushed my teeth in 2002. (I use dettol to keep as hygenically clean as I can, but truth be told far more gets used in 'cleansing' myself than has ever been used to wash myself clean.)
I also have Tourette-like symptoms and punctuate an out-loud running commentary of all I do with shouted words to complete every sentence, every action, every movement from one space to another. Enough- you get the picture and it hurts to stand here at the computer typing in one position for too long.
Putting it simply; in medical terms, I'm pretty disabled by my OCD; in layman's terms, I'm as mad as a hatter.
I have been on a downward spiral since I became housebound and in the last six months have bordered constantly on suicidal because of the constant pain in my leg ulcers (not to mention the arthritis in my shoulders, back,hips, knees and feet)and my poor quality of life generally.
I took up creative writing about 3 years ago as part of my therapy for Post Traumatic Stress Disorder and enjoyed it so much that I began writing in earnest last year. I had an idea for a novel where the main character has OCD and it is now fairly well underway. Shameless self-advertising coming up.... http://rosegardener.livejournal.com/
The novel is set in a modern prison, for me an analogy for being housebound. As I researched the background material for the book, I realised that someone in prison for murder has many more physical comforts and basically a better quality of life than I do. So, what is my crime? OCD. Just that. I've been keeping myself in a prison of my own making all these years for the unforgivable crime of having OCD.
Well,no more. I decided to make use of my liking for magical thinking and chose 1st January 2011 as my start date. (The numbers kind of added up in a nice way in my OCD eyes.) And the time was right.
For the last twelve days, I have got up without any ocd type rituals AT ALL. It takes me an average of 10 minutes to get out of bed, slop out and get my gloves on for the day. I haven't shouted once to get through a doorway, and only used a shouting ritual once for self-reassurance yesterday at a moment of extreme stress. I have reduced my running commentary to a few reassuring phrases as I get my gloves on and off and am able to get gloves off and go to bed with the minimum of checking rituals. It's down to around 30 minutes to shut down the computer, open gloves for tomorrow, get the used ones off and get back into my safe area. Pretty darn amazing! Not to mention less tiring, and ,unbelievably, LESS STRESSFUL!
Now for my really big news. Friends, I advise you to sit, perhaps even lay a few cushions on the floor to break your fall when you slip off it (for fall off your chair you surely will...)
TODAY, I OPENED MY FRONT DOOR WITHOUT SHOUTING, WITHOUT FANCY RITUALS AND STEPPED OUT ONTO MY PORCH!!!!
First time in over six years. First step in overcoming being housebound. And a big confidence boost that the smaller achievements in my daily routines can and will continue.
I truely believed I was going to serve a life sentence, imprisoned by OCD. But now I am the living proof that it CAN be done. I'm not claiming a cure- I know that I have a very long way to go just to reach where most of you are already at.
But with every ritual I omit, I grow stronger. With every day that passes, I grow in confidence.
And I know I'll trip and fall. It is inevitable there will be hiccups on the road to recovery. I hope that at such times my friends will be there to support me and my writing will continue to motivate me to change and improve my life.
I have achieved this because the time was right for me. I hope that you chose a time that is right for you soon. Why not make it 2011 and we can take this journey together? You just have to find a reason to live. Mine is for the joy of writing. What is yours going to be?
I urge you to look for it and to take the plunge. You have nothing to lose by trying, even if you fail. But think of the living you miss out on by not giving it a go. Don't be like me and waste six years. Do it now. Do it for yourself. Because whether or not you believe it, you are worth taking a chance on. Good Luck! Here's to the best year of our lives yet- the year we are about to live.
Rose.

"Hi,
I've been with my girlfriend for two years now. We get along really well and I at least think I love her. I know she loves me very much. About six months ago I started feeling bad because I knew she wanted us to get married but I wasn't sure if I was ready. The truth is I wasn't sure I wanted to marry HER. So I told her how bad I felt and she got pretty upset. About three months ago I raised the subject again because I really did feel bad, and she decided to leave until I made up my mind. We were separated for about a month. During this time, I didn't feel any better but I wasn't missing her badly either. I just didn't know what to do. My therapist, who helped me a lot in dealing with this, repeatedly said that from what she """"""""hears"""""""" we make a great couple, we get along really well and I should take a """"""""leap of faith"""""""" and marry her. My family and friends also said the same type of things.
So why wasn't I sure? I have to admit - and I am a bit ashamed to say this - that the only thing that bothered me about her was (and still is) her looks. I am ashamed because I wish I could focus on her inner beauty, which is great. Let me clarify - she doesn't look bad at all but I am not really that attracted to her. I constantly compare her to other women and think they are better looking than she is.
After we were separated for a month we decided to meet and talk. The minute I saw her I was dazzled. I said to myself: """"""""Is this the person you said wasn't so good looking? Are you crazy?"""""""" We kissed and I felt like I was on a first date or something... There and then I suddenly got the courage to take that leap of faith. I asked her to marry me. We then drove to her parents to tell them, then woke up my parents... Everyone in my family was thrilled!
The next day I was still excited about the whole thing but slowly, I began to think I had made a big mistake. As the days passed she didn't look so good to me anymore and it started bothering me again. We are scheduled to be married at the end of May and I have about twenty relatives coming from overseas just for the wedding (!). Everyone around me and my family is totally excited - everyone but me... I can't believe I will be with a hundred people who came to rejoice with me, who will all be having a ball, while I am not even sure I want to be there!!! I feel as if I am misleading people, lying to them. I don't have the guts to cancel the wedding and I am sure if I did this the damage to my girlfriend would be tremendous. Not to mention how this would affect twenty people who all purchased non-refundable airline tickets...
There is a voice inside of me that tells me that she is the one for me - she loves me, she accepts my obsessive-compulsive behaviour, and we are very good friends. But there is also a voice telling me she is not - that there are plenty of fish in the sea and it shouldn't be a problem to find someone that I am sure I want to marry. Of course my therapist says that I should be very grateful I have found someone I love who accepts me for what I am with my OCD, and that if we break up it may take me years until I find someone suitable again.
Has anyone been in a similar situation? Any word of advice would be most appreciated.
Thank you.","['feeling bad', 'OCD', 'shame', 'Compulsive behavior']",['obsessive'],"['obsessive', 'feeling bad', 'Compulsive behavior', 'shame', 'OCD']",,1.0,0,0,

we have never smacked our sons, so you can imagine that when i began having horried images and nightmare s i thought i had compleatly lost it and asked to be taken into hospital to keep my son and husband safe.
i spent 6 weeks in there trying to come to terms with what i was experianceing, whilst in the hospital i found all the other spikes (knife fear of harming self and others ect, i would wince at the thought of picking up a knife thinking i had/would stab myself, well...................................
that was then and my basic story of my ocd, NOW im back home have been for four months, in that time ive paid private for a CBT specilist in Ocd, i am know playing with my sons again in basket ball, walking taking cuddling, i using exposure therapy for sharp objects of which i wouldnt even go into a room with 7 months ago.
i know how hard it is with OCD i am finally facing the fact that it is OCD and not me, so now i say to myself ITS NOT ME ITS MY OCD i can now live my life again ive seen the most horried of horried things when it comes to images and thoughts and my sons but the real me would never ever harm anyone its took a while to reolise that so now im kicking butt of ocd
i dont ask for reasurance, if im in a shop i stay till it passes i sort of hold the images and thoughts rather than the ocd just plonking them there and frightning the hebies out of me. if that makes sence
its not nice admitting we have OCD but if we dont give up and keep taking little steps on the road to recovery we get there in the end
i am now going out on my own, getting through ocd attacks on my own, shoping on my own, cooking on my own, going to night out with freinds and more importently begining to live my life with my family again. and am now looking forward to continuing my job as a.......................

"Hey!!
I can relate so well to how you feel- I have the same thing with photos of my boyfriend and I try to think good stuff instead- Its interesting and reassuring that you seem to be going through the same processes as me as well as worrying if its real or if you are just running away from the truth cos I am going to see someone about my anxieties (mainly around my relationship) and i hope that its not real and its OCD cos i really don't think anything would make sense if it wasn't. (plus I have had major anxiety issues over my sexuality in the past- completely obsessing and checking all the time).
And its your relationship anxieties that led to a diagnosis of OCD? Have i got that right? Would you mind expanding on that a little if its not going to cause you too much upset? I know everyones different but it would be useful to know before I go see the Doc. I know I get really bad anxieties when watching love- themed films and from the same sort of songs etc- the most random and insignificant things to do with relationships set my anxieties off!!
I can really relate to the ME side of things- my Dad is a sufferer of 10 years and its an evil condition that has sucked a lot out of a once very able and active man- what makes it worse is that i guess like OCD, so few people truly understand it. Some think he's making it up despite him losing his job etc cos he is too ill to work.
The last thing you should be doing is apologising- OCD itself is more than enough for anyone to have to bear and they should never apologise for themselves- you have that and ME!!

"Hi everyone,
Wanted to write in about a break-through.
I had a bad night last night; went to bed early and then because of the meds, I had an insomniac night. I sat up in bed, though, and decided to write some poetry for my portfolio. I've found poetry very consoling as of late, and very therapeutic. (is that how you spell it? *shuffles collar* hee )
In any case, I woke up this morning, and instantly started worrying.I guess you could say I've been feeling ashamed recently, because of this particular OCD fear, after my psychiatrist told me, and I quote """"""""not to get my knickers in a twist about it,"""""""" and feeling embarrassed that I let it get this far to the point where it's affected me so. Maybe that's why I got depressed, because I was ashamed; I got very anxious and lonely yesterday, and felt I couldn't talk to anyone. I felt alone and got very quietly paranoid and upset. When I went out for a society meeting last night, my voice was weak and I was getting my words mixed up, and I felt very tired.
Anyway, I'm going home today and I felt low, because one of my depressing feelings has been that I no longer fit in there, what with my brother and his family living there, and it being stressful, and also my parents not able to grasp what's going on in my head. I feel ashamed of what's been going on in my head, and I guess I felt I might not feel welcome at home. In any case, I started getting upset just now, and my housemate saw, but then we just wound up talking about other things - our work, clothes, etc - and she made me laugh.
And it helped.
I don't know if some might consider this healthy or not, whether it's bottling it up or not, but it feels healthy to me right now. I read somewhere that it's good to talk about things that are less stressful and I think this has served as a reminder to me that I've been thinking and ruminating about the OCD too much, and making it stronger. It was an incredible break-through in a matter of moments, because I've been feeling so bad recently and feeling, well... let's just say the suicidal thoughts have been lingering. I know it's good to talk about how you feel, but it helped, just today, to talk about something else, and it felt so much less harsh, so much less stressful. After all, if I think about my ruminations - which I think is what I've been doing, as it's been vicious circle after vicious circle... well. That makes it worse, right?

"I will explain the title of this post.
Certain members of my family and also personal friends have this idea I have an """"""""addictive personality"""""""" despite the careful disclosure of my condition - OCD.
I used Illegal substances (long time ago), tranquillisers, excessive amounts of alcohol and more recently got into gambling (haven't had a bet since 9/2/2016).
I don't believe I was ever """"""""addicted"""""""" to any of these things (although I was dependent on large quantities of tranquillisers) I've mentioned but since the mid-90's until recently I've had dependency on DISTRACTION because I couldn't stand the way I felt.
All of the above may give some short-term relief - just like tranquillisers - but in the medium and long-term there are very serious consequences with this behaviour for an individual's mental health, relationships, financial stability, self-respect and respect from others especially when it comes to gambling, drug and alcohol abuse.
I'm in a good place at the moment although I know OCD can wax and wane and am not currently in therapy. This forum has helped me so much (I hope I've given something back), my wife, GP and some of my friends and one member of my family.
Fundamentally I had to realise that after such a long-time with the condition - I COULD not rely on other people (especially non-sufferers). I had to find some inner resolve.
There are many situations I still feel uncomfortable in but I do actually believe I am in some sort of """"""""recovery"""""""".
I hope the above is helpful and makes sense.

"So since I had a bad relapse in September I have noticed my OCD spikes about 7+ days before my period. I am thinking about mentioning this to my psychiatrist and perhaps suggesting a contraceptive pill to maybe help this. But I have also read on google that the contraceptive pill can make OCD symptoms worse. So my question is does anyone have any experience they can share with managing OCD symptoms and hormone changes.

"Hi. I'm new to all this. Although, not new to OCD i suppose. I have had it for as long as i can remember, but have only really started recognising the disorder for what it is.
I seem to do what i assume are the 'normal' rituals of an OCD suffer,
i can't touch toilet flushes or door handles,
i have to touch certain things in an order before bed at night,
i have to 'blow kisses' (so embarrassing) through the door when i leave the house as i feel this helps 'leave it safe',
if i touch one side of the body i have to touch the other side in the same place as if to 'even it out',
when i see a photo of a celebrity or attractive person in a paper/magazine i take a deep breath as if have to 'inhale' all the beauty out of the page into myself,
etc etc etc...
but what i find worst.. worst of all.. and what i don't know is OCD or not..
is that i obsess over my boyfriends past. I have questioned him about everything he has done in his past with other women and i have to know every single little detail, it hurts me so much to know but it's like I HAVE to know the truth or i just can't bear it. I could be having a perfectly nice day or i'll be at work and suddenly images come into my head of my boyfriend being with another girl from his past and i can't get rid of the thought.
I try and replace the thought with something else but if i don't 'complete' the thought i keep going back to it until i have. Often, i will obsess so much about a certain thought that when i go home i will question my boyfriend repeatedly about that certain girl in my thoughts. Even if he's already told me whats happened, i have to know again. I will look for images and details about these girls on the internet (social networking websites etc..) and torture myself by seeing photos etc..
He is so kind to me and understanding, but obviously this is taking it's tole on him and it's tearing us apart..
We could be having a beautiful candle-lit meal or a lovely day together and then suddenly bam!, bad thoughts pop into my head and i can't control them..
He can often tell, and says; 'Come on my love, no bad thoughts now..' and i get rid of them as best i can so not to ruin the time we're spending together, but sometimes they get the better of me and i start asking him questions again.
It has of course affected our sex life as well. These bad thoughts link to my self-esteem and convince me that i'm not as good, or intelligent or attractive as the other girls he's been with, regardless how many times he tells me he never thinks of his past (only when i bring it up) and that he loves me so much and wants to spend the rest of his life with me..
Also, when i kiss my boyfriend if i don't think of good thoughts or if i think of another girl he's been with by the last kiss i have to kiss him again. So that the last kiss i always have a good thought in my head.
I'm sorry i've completly gone off in one there so i apologise but as you can imagine i'm suffering terribly. I went to councelling and after 7 sessions she basically gave up on me. So what's wrong with me?
I feel like i'm a completly-insane-jealous-nutbag! I already know that i suffer from mild OCD and have always just lived with it in my day-to-day life, but the way i am in relationships (i have been like this with ex-boyfriends also) is that also my OCD?????
Please, people don't tell me to 'get over the past' and 'concentrate on the present' because if i could i wouldn't be writing this now. It's so difficult for me, and i don't know what to do with myself.
Any help and advice would be very gratefully recieved, Thank you.

"When I saw the social worker she gave me some advice to get pass a ritual. When I told her about closing my door and the ritual I did she told me to walk away, go downstairs and wait for five minutes and if I still need to do it than do it. She wanted me to try it straight away and ever since I have been. It doesn't work I can't leave the door, I get as far as the stairs in sight and turn back to finish the ritual. It's really annoying me because I just can't walk away from it and my hands are sore after because I push my door handle up tons of times like more than 16 probably but not for sure. When I do it the metal sides of the handle imprints on my hand and is painful but luckily fades after. It's the same with the light switches which are making my thumbs especially hurt more now than they used to when I did it. Today I went to do the ritual but my mom was coming and I had to run into another room so she wouldn't see me perform it, it was then I realised how ashamed of it I was, but I couldn't go back into my bedroom as there would be more rituals to perform again and it has got worse as now Im beginning to do the whole ritual then do it all again just to be safe.
Has anyone got any advice? I'd be really grateful for replies, thank you,

I started citalopram about a month ago, seemed to be doing fine and really started to see the woods for the trees and chill for the first time in over 20 years, I had a couple of nasty relapses making me feel I am back to square one but after a week I recovered.
I still get the odd spike however they seem to have more power now that I have someone special in my life, same fear of harming kids OCD which because I have a girl now its like its stronger as I feel that overwhelming urge to confess - I don't want to screw this up because she is really beautiful and to be honest I am amazed that she sees anything in me, apart from my eyes which if I do say so myself, are pretty sexy - I digress.. anyway, whats the deal? Should I still be getting spikes on meds or shall I increase the dose? I'm on 20 mgs atm...
Also, I might tell this girl what the deal is with OCD but vow to start the CBT and exposure therapy as it wouldn't be nice not being able to lead a normal life with her avoiding things.

"Hey all,
Hope everyone is well.
I'm just looking for a bit of advice 'cause like I think I've already mentioned on some other thread I've never been officially diagnosed with OCD but it just the constant rumination that when it gets bad lasts days even weeks. When it's like that I can barely concentrate on anything else in life like I'm numb to everything going on around me and no amount of reason I try to think up to counter act the thoughts works, at the time.
I was given CBT a few years ago for anxiety and panic attacks but I stopped going because I was just been given booklets to read then come back the following week to get a new booklet and although they were informative, I didn't really feel any better. A while later I went back to the doctors and he offered me CBT again and recommended I kept it going for at least a year but I turned it down because I thought it would just be the same as last time, pop in get the latest issues of mental magazine (It wasnt called that I should add) then go home.
I debating now whether to go back to the doctors and ask about CBT because I need something, but I feel a bit guilty or like I'm wasting his time because I've already blown it twice.","['hope', 'OCD', 'anxiety', 'anxiety', 'guilt', 'wasting', 'Thought']",['rumination'],"['rumination', 'anxiety', 'OCD', 'wasting', 'Thought', 'hope', 'guilt']",1.0,,1,0,

"Hi all,
I'm just looking for a bit of advice if anyone can give it.
I have had OCD for about 6 years, however, I never sought medical help until about 3 years ago. At first my doctor put it down to post natal depression.....although he said I had the signs and symptoms of OCD, because it appeared after the birth of my children he would treat me as having a form of post natal.
He prescribed me a daily dose of 20mg of Seroxat, and arranged for me to see a nurse at the surgery, who had knowledge of mental health issues.... I have to admit, I only attended a few of these sesions with the nurse as I found her to be of no help, and very patronizing. I did continue with the Seroxat for just over a year, and came off them so my husband and I could have another baby. I found the Seroxat very effective....although I still had the thoughts and the rituals, they were no where near as bad as before I was taking the Seroxat.
About 6 months into the pregnancy.....around April time, my OCD took a major turn for the worse, and things got very hard. I went to see my doc, and asked if it was possible to have another prescription for Seroxat, ready to take as soon as my baby was born. This was when he decided that it was not post natal depression that I had, and actually refused to give me a prescription. He wanted to refer me to the Mental Health Department, as he said he didn't feel he would be doing his job properly by just sending me off with a prescription....He said that although it would possibly make me feel better in the short term, it wouldn't solve the overall problem.
We have an 18 month waiting list to see a clinical psychologist here, but I am lucky that I was offered to have fortnightly CBT sessions with a Community Mental Health Nurse, who has had plenty of training and experience of OCD. She liases very closely with the Clinical Psychologist to make sure we are heading the correct way, and it's got my foot in the door so to speak.......Things have even harder since starting the CBT 8 weeks ago, and I now have an appointment to see the Psych in 2 weeks (a bit of a difference to the 18 months had I not accepted the offer of meeting with the nurse!)
I had my last CBT session on Wednesday, and I admitted that things were at an all time low....and it was suggested that I should start taking the Seroxat again, get my brain chemicals back into some kind of balance before we continue with the Gradual Exposure that we're due to start. So I got a prescription for Seroxat, and took my first one last night.
But am I doing the right thing? Or am I just giving in too quickly at the first sign of things getting bad? I was warned that things would get worse before they got better, so should I ride through the storm without the medication or give in and take it?
Sorry it's a long post, just need to get it out
Any advice is greatly appreciated.

"Hi All
I have posted a few times over the years regarding my constant rumination and confusion about my attraction to females and males and constant rumination and checking of attraction (never had a serious girlfriend in my 30's now) and been on a hamster wheel as Polar Bear rightly put it off trying to understand myself and genuine confusion about sexuality.  I realise I need to step up my game again in terms of not checking and ruminating over the subject (looking at instagram, facebook, TV to check for attraction etc) and try to leave it alone from an OCD perspective which is always tough.
However , I also know that psycho-sexual therapy is available by referral on the NHS and given my age and the length of time this has gone on I feel it might be time to at least give this  a go (if my GP approves) and see what I can achieve with it, alongside my strategy from an OCD perspective. 
My question really is, has anyone else who has ruminated and obsessed about sexuality sought help also through Psycho-sexual therapy, and, if so was it was beneficial alongside implementing OCD CBT strategies.
  Many thanks

I'm just wondering how i can apply the four steps or CBT-like thinking to my situation and wanted some advice. I'm being assessed to see what psychological help i'll be offered next week but that will most likely involve being put on a long waiting list anyway so i was wondering if anyone could help me help myself in the mean time.
After years of mental rituals my ocd has now switched to being more rumination based where i spend hours obsessing over my mental rituals (OCD about OCD in a way). My mental rituals are apologising for certain thoughts or actions in my head, which sounds simple but gets complicated when i am apologising for more than one thing at a time, I have to make sure the apology 'counts' for every possible thought I've had over a period of time. i've had years where this was 'perfected' where I just did the ritual and that was it but now my mind keeps analysing the ritual and finding more and more flaws. So a trigger for me would be a thought coming into my head that this apologising ritual is imperfect in some way and then i would spend hours analysing and 'solving' the 'problem'.
So if i was to apply a four steps approach, would i say that each time i am triggered i ignore the thought or label it as an ocd thought and carry on doing the ritual even though it now feels 'unresolved' or 'imperfect'? And then refocus to distract myself from the guilt and anxiety that comes from this feeling that things are unresolved even when my mind is telling me it's not ocd and that i have a responsibility to stop harm occuring etc?

"Hi,
First time on here although I have been looking at the forums for quite some time. I have been coping with my current OCD theme for about three months and have been trying to live life normally however have still felt this sickening feeling and thoughts throughout. I have been managing by saying I will just get through this day or this weekend and telling myself it will pass soon like it did before. I honestly don't think I can cope anymore, I have had to take the day off work today as I am feeling so strange. I feel like I don't care about anything anymore and feel almost spaced out. I constantly worry it is not OCD as to the outside world I have been fine so if it really was OCD I would show outward symptoms wouldn't I? Apart from being constantly tired and run down. I feel like I have been lying to my friends and family and if they really knew what I was thinking they wouldn't love me . I am even thinking I am lying to you all by posting on here and I just haven't accepted what I am. I have made an appointment with my doctor as I want to try some medication as I can't cope with this horrible feeling I almost feel out of control and only feel slightly better when I am in bed.
Coming to the actual title of the post, sorry to ramble on. I have been in touch with a therapist who specalises in OCD and she seems very nice and has encouraged me to go on the waiting list. I am terrified to discuss my issues with her however as I am worried she will report me as I work in a professional role with children and am worried she will think I am unfit to be in that role. I am just wondering if this is likely, I have been putting off getting help because of this fear and am thinking of waiting until the summer when I will have left my job, but how I have been feeling recently makes me think I can't cope until then
Sorry to sound so self pitying I just feel so hopeless.

"Hi.
My name is jamie and about a week ago i heard a story on the radio about OCD. It started by talking about washing rituals and then it moved on to checking rituals. The checking part caught my attention when it mentioned people turning light switches on and off until it felt right. I realised then that i have done this since i was about 12 years old and now im 22. So, over the last week i have been researching the internet on OCD and have now realised that i also perform counting rituals, repeating actions, need to touch objects, need to read writing over and over and having certain objects in order.
I am going to see a doctor tomorrow but am worried about the whole thing as it has come as a bit of a shock. I have read a lot of the posts on here and it has helped because before i thought i was the only person who did this.
I would appreciate any advice from anyone on what to expect when i see the doctor and basically what happens next.
Any advice would be appreciated.
Thanks for listening

"Hi,
I'm going through a really bad time at the moment & have no one to talk to. I have had really bad OCD for about 5-6 yrs I fear contamination, dirt germs etc. I have explained to my family about how I feel & the thoughts I get but even after all this time they still don't really understand. I feel like I'm the only one who worries about contamination as much as I do, even if I wash my hands, self, clothes cups etc many times I still don't believe they are clean. Its even got to the point where if I use anti-bacterial sprays, wipes or bleach I still don't feel some things are clean and never will be.
Over the years if something has touched me or my belongings, clothes, bedding, etc in some cases I have felt they are contaminated for life and will never be clean again no matter how much I wash them or bleach them, so the end result being I've just thrown them away. I still do this at times but what seams to case the problems & arguments with my family is they don't understand why I'm like it with some situations & not with others, & to be honest neither do I.
I have previously been on medication but I don't really think it made much difference, in fact I think my depression was even worse, I did have a short course of CBT (if you can call talking constantly for the whole 12 wks about my past CBT) this did not make much progress either. I have recently been in touch with my local community mental health providers & I'm currently waiting for an assessment to be carried out in a few wks form now. I have found it very frustrating and difficult to access help for many reasons including I HATE leaving the house because I feel If I go out then I will never be able to be clean again as all the germs in the air & from people will stick to me & never be washed off. I also hate being in places with others i.e shops, doctors waiting rooms etc, then I have the problem of I'm afraid to touch doors, hand rails or sit down as I'm afraid that the germs of the person who touched or sat there before will forever contaminate me........ I know deep deep deep down that this is not true & when I have been out in the past nothing serious has happened or the world has not ended, but it still doesn't stop me from believing these thoughts (especially at the moment).
All I get from my family is """"""""You need help"""""""" & """"""""get to the doctors"""""""" but its just so hard especially when I haven't left my home in over 12months & this was only to go to the doctors then. I also don't feel I can ask anyone to visit me at home as its really in need or repair & re-decoration & I feel that if someone comes in they will think no wonder she has dirt & contamination issues living here. I KNOW I need help & I really do want to get better, so I can get back to having a life but I just feel stuck in a vicious circle.
As I have explained I have many issues with dirt, contamination & germs and as I live with my family I do ask them to carry out rituals in the hope it will make me feel better, but often this is not the case as I'm increasingly not feeling any relief from this. One big issue at the moment that is causing me problems & arguments in the home, is all to do with a stray cat. Now my mom started to feed this cat about 12months ago, at first just out side (because he wouldn't come in) then in the kitchen. Now at first I hated the idea of him coming in at all, but for my mom (as she does so much for me) I thought ok its not that bad once he's eaten he will be off.... But then my mom wanted him to come in the house & stop for periods of time, ok I thought the more often he comes I'll just get used to it but this was not the case. In fact the more he come's the more I'm worrying about who he belonged to, where he go's when he's not here, where or who's gardens does he sleep in or lay down. Then when he is in the kitchen I'm worried about him rubbing up the cupboards, oven & handles or jumping up on the work surfaces. At the moment I don't even want to walk in the kitchen let alone eat food or drinks made in there. I have also asked my mom & brother not to stroke or fuss him because of these worries, & if they do I feel they won't be able to get their hand contamination free.
When I have explained time & time again my thoughts, worries & fears all I get in return is he's only a poor little cat, how can you be so nasty. I'm honestly not being nasty, spiteful or hateful to this cat & my family know I'm not like that especially as we used to have 2 cats many years ago before they died.
I'm so confused I really don't know what to do, I feel as if nothing is safe or clean anymore.

"Hi There,
I am fairly new here, have only ever posted once which was last year. . I have had OCD for about 15 years and it has taken various forms, often more than one theme at a time.  I am married with 1 child and have been with my wife for about 15 years and married for about 7 of them. One of the themes I have struggled with is relationship OCD. I have on occasion been convinced that I have cheated on my wife or that I am Gay ( I was so convinced at one point I almost 'came out' to my parents in my early 20's.). These have caused me many distressing hours and days and weeks that have almost debilitated me at times.
The issues bothering my at the moment is my relationship with my wife. I have often found other women attractive which I accept is part of human nature but this has brought on all types of guilt and soul searching, as part of my efforts to avoid this scenario I  have gone out my way to avoid any unnecessary conversations with women as I feel too guilty about speaking to them and ruminate over I am just being friendly and sociable or there is a deeper motive to this. This has resulted in a heightened state where I am nervous around other women. I know logically by avoiding women I am adding to the issue. I have tried different approaches such as trying to chat more to them but I get a guilt complex and rumination starts again.
Recently at work there is a woman who has been quite friendly to me and I find her easy to chat to it has 'got into my ocd' as I would put it. I am now wondering if I would prefer to be with this person rather than my wife. I have no idea by the way if this person likes me in that way This has left me feeling very anxious and depressed to the point when I feel like crying at times. On a logical level I suppose I do like her in a 'crush' type way. But the thought of leaving my wife and son leave me feeling very depressed and upset. i","['Thought', 'OCD', 'guilt']","['rumination', 'theme']","['rumination', 'Thought', 'theme', 'OCD', 'guilt']",1.0,,1,0,"I have had OCD for about 15 years and it has taken various forms, often more than one theme at a time. / One of the themes I have struggled with is relationship OCD"
"I developed OCD in relation to contamination during February of this year, I had no trigger event, Im not depressed, anxious, or off my head. The OCD manifests itself as a fear of bodily fluids (not saliva or blood). I really freak out if I believe I have came into contact with bodily fluids, this leads me to either wash my hands for too long, and only occasionally too many times, or In the worst cases I have to change my clothes and take a shower. I do have the usual urge to check things however this is now under control. I am slowly but surely getting the contamintion OCD under control and the hand washing is getting less and less and the time taken to wash my hands is getting shorter. However, today I saw a small brown patch on my shower towel, which I now believe to be dried blood as I bled on the towel last night, but at the time I thought it was something much worse. This meant another quick shower and the towel going into the washing. Then when taking the towel down for the washing along with my other clothes, the ocd gave me a hard time as it gave me a thought of cross contamination between the towel and the clothes which I was wearing. I however didnt give in and get changed, instead I told myself I avoided the brown mark when taking the towel for washing hence cross contamination was an in possibility. Other than making sure i clean properly after the tiolet thus meaning any marks couldn't possibly be bodily fluids, has anybody else got any tips for getting over the finishing line and beating the OCD as I am very close with only self help? The other thing I would like advice with is bins, if something falls out of a bin even a paper bin I simply cannot seem to just pick it up and put it back in without then washing my hands or If I touch a bin, again I feel the need to wash my hands.

"Hey, hope everyone is doing okay
Today I went to the pharmacy to try sort out my hands. It's been about two months and the rash or whatever it is still hasn't gone, it's spreading, splitting, just so sore. Anyway, I went to the pharmacy and the guy asked did it hurt? I said yeah. Was it itchy? Again, yes. Then he asked how long I'd had it, then after telling him around 2 months, he seemed so shocked!(deffinately wasn't expecting that response haha). So my mum stepped in and explained why I had it, that I have OCD.
He seemed more reassured, yet worried. He told me if I knew that there was medication out there to help with OCD, and of course I do. But the last medication I had made me sick, and mum took me off it. But now I'm older apparently there's more medication available? And he has urged me to go see a doctor, otherwise my hands can't get better. But for the mean time he's given me some steriod cream, so fingers crossed!( )
Thing is, my past with doctors was never great. I don't have the guts to go through the whole first meeting with a new doctor, and explaining I have OCD. My worst fear is being told to see another therapist, I've have 3 years of therapy. It just never worked, I don't have the guts to say anything. I mean, what if in my appointment I crack. I can't let a doctor know the suicidal thoughts, the rituals, not again.
However, I do understand that medication would help, to calm the anxiety, I know my OCD has got so much worse, but I dunno, I'm just scared to go against it I guess(OCD that is) .Honestly I have no idea, just so nervous to even make an appointment.
Can anyone give ideas how to just break it to the doctor but not crack at the same time? And what medication would I have/is available? - Really don't want to go.","['hope', 'rash', 'shock', 'urge', 'fear', 'Suicidal', 'Thought', 'Rituals', 'anxiety', 'anxiety', 'OCD', 'Medication', 'Suicidal thoughts']",[],"['urge', 'Suicidal', 'Suicidal thoughts', 'anxiety', 'OCD', 'shock', 'fear', 'rash', 'Thought', 'Rituals', 'Medication', 'hope']",,1.0,1,1,"I can't let a doctor know the suicidal thoughts, the rituals, / My worst fear is being told to see another therapist, "
"Another embarrassing ocd post. I dont know if this is actually a real concern or if its just OCD but i'm scared and having a lot of anxiety right now.  I have a neighbor that I don't get along with. It started with him throwing food over my fence to feed my dog when I'm not home. I caught him once but never confronted him. It got to the point where my dog started gaining a lot of weight  so i would leave him on the other side of the house so my neighbor wouldnt be able to throw the food to my dog. After i moved my dog to the other side of the house and kept him there, he starts losing all the excess weight.  I never confronted my neighbor about throwing food over because i dont like confrontation. As a way to get revenge I sometiems would blast music loud enough for him to hear at night. Every time we see each other we would both exchange angry looks. Just earlier this morning I was outside my backyard and I saw him in his car warming it up. I started hearing this weird sound coming from his backyard. It was kind of a high pitched sound, kind of sounded like gibberish you hear on the radio but the noise was high pitched. I listened to that weird noise for about maybe 2 mins max, and now I'm regretting it. It bothered me for some reason. It was uncomfortable to listen to because of it's high pitch. A few minutes later i went back into my house and then i started hearing a ringing noise in my left ear which I think is called tinnitus. After hearing the ringing noise in my left ear, it started hurting a little bit. Right now my left ear is still hurting..I started having anxiety and started to think that my neighbor was mad at me for playing loud music at night so i thought maybe he turned on that weird high pitched radio noise to damage my ear drums. I keep thinking he is out to get me because we don't get along and that he is mad because i play loud music at night. Now i'm worried that my left ear is permanently damage. After that ringing noise, its still hurting and i think im experiencing some hearing loss in the left ear. Feels like the hearing ability in my left ear is greatly reduced. I keep covering my right ear up to see if I can hear anything with my left ear. I still can hear but i feel like the hearing ability in my left ear is greatly reduced. And then I did something that maybe i shouldnt do. I googled """"""""causes of tinnitus"""""""" and then the first thing that popped up was """"""""The most common cause of tinnitus is damage and loss of the tiny sensory hair cells in the cochlea of the inner ear. This tends to happen as people age, and it can also result from prolonged exposure to excessively loud noise. Hearing loss may coincide with tinnitus.""""""""
Now I'm having a lot of anxiety about this and my left ear is still hurting. I dont know what to do. It is morning now and I haven't slept because i drank too much coffee last night. I googled to see if sleep deprivation causes tinnitus and it turns out it can cause ringing in the ears if you havent slept but the weird thing is that I used to stay up all night regularly and I never experienced ringing in the ears or even pain in the ears or any kind of hearing loss.  This makes me think the weird high pitched noise that came from my neighbors house caused damage to my left ear. Now im thinking what if he deliberately turned on that noise because he knew that I was outside and still awake and then he went inside his car so that he wouldnt be exposed to the noise. I don't know if the pain in the left ear will stop and i don't know if the hearing reduction is permanent. I enjoy listening to music a lot.. I hope this is not a permanent thing  i am too young to have permanent hearing loss in one ear.

"Hello,
I wondered if anyone can relate to the problem I have, please? I just need to know I can get better. I know it might take a while but to hear from someone who might have the same thing or similar, would seem a comfort.
I have recently been diagnosed by a psychiatrist with OCD brought on through trauma. I have had OCD (mainly mental rituals to prevent stuff happening) many years but over the past couple of years and after more upset/stress in my personal life, it has steadily got worse. I find myself afraid of taking any medicines or even eating most foods now, in case I get an allergic reaction. I know, it's silly. (I do have a food allergy but it never used to be more of a concern than it need be to me). Even typing this is difficult because """"""""confessing"""""""" it is hard.
I want so much to eat and to be relaxed. I want to eat and enjoy it and relax but I panic. I am waiting for treatment (CBT) but with waiting lists as they are, this could take a while to begin. I just need to know this can get better. I have a daughter and I don't want to affect her with my fears. I am trying my best but it would help to know this can be cured.

"The last few days have been bad and my ocd is doing overtime - again. The rituals are much worse and I am constantly feeling sad, very low and crying a lot. I am having trouble coping with being a mum because I am irritable and lack patience. I can't stop my thoughts which are about future events that I really dread, the loss of certain people that I love. Several years ago I had a breakdown following a bereavement but somehow managed to get through it. I am afraid that the next time this happens I won't cope and will not be able to hold onto my sanity. My problems are made worse by the fact that I have major trust issues and I go through stages, like now, of doubting whether my husband genuinely loves me and cares for me. Sadly he is not the kind of person who can openly show his emotions and I wish he was because then maybe I wouldn't doubt him so much.
At the end of the day he and our little boy are the only ones I will have left that I care about. I don't trust the rest of the family and deliberately keep contact with friends to a minimum. I am scared that if I can't trust my husband then I will end up feeling very alone. The future is a great worry and all of it is dragging me down.
I have had counselling but it didn't help, I am a coward when it comes to meds and think that cbt may only help with the rituals, not the thoughts.
All in all, I can't help feeling hopeless about the future.

"I am so afraid of posting anything. As some of you know i deal with harm and hyper-responsibility ocd. I am so afraid this post may upset someone and that i am just being selfish by posting to make me feel better. I am starting to get confused about ERP and when to use it as well as knowing when something is ocd or a legitimate concern.
I have had a couple situations recently where i thought it was ocd but when i talked to my husband and sister they said they were things to be careful about. They were both times i thought about using ERP but i didnt. What if i would have used ERP and then something happened to someone? It would be my fault, right?
Since i have been confused about this i was remembering something that happened almost a year ago where i used ERP and maybe i shouldnt have.
I was working on a food truck at a festival to help raise money for a preschool.
Before i started working on the truck i had scratched my nose with my knuckle. I dont think there was any running water on the truck. I didnt wash my hands. My kids felt like they were catching something and i may have been too.
I was handing out food and not really thinking anything about the itching of the nose until a woman who clearly was being treated for cancer came for some dumplings. I was the one handing her her food and all of a sudden it popped into my head about itching my nose and i shouldnt be handling her food or handing her her food. Then i thought if i stopped giving her her food and had someone else give her different food that would be giving into my ocd. I decided to do ERP and give her the food. I tried to be careful when handing her the food and utensil but then she couldnt get a good hold of it. I was afraid my hand was getting too close to the parf of the spoon that would be going in her mouth. I gave her her food and i started worrying right away that this woman was going to get sick and die because of catching something from me. I freaked out about this for a long time. I even spoke to a psychologist about it.
My kids and i did end up catching a respiratory bug like bronchitis.
7 months later at the church where i teach preschool a woman was being buried who died from cancer. The picture of her looked like it could have been the same woman i served the food to. I freaked out thinking i caused her to die.
i eventually was able to get passed it. Now with not knowing when something is really ocd and not knowing when to use ERP this spike is back full force again. Was that scenerio the wrong time to use ERP. I decided to give the lady the food knowing it could possibly cause her harm. Did i try to harm that woman on purpose just to work on MY OCD and use ERP? If that woman became sick from my germs and she wasnt able to get better because she was also fighting cancer, that makes it my fault. I feel so scared and guilty.
I am so afraid that any decision i make will harm someone and if i make a decision based on ocd and erp and i am wrong someone will get hurt or worse. I just dont know what to do. I feel like i should be punished.
i was supposed to have a therapist appointment yesterday and had the wrong time so i had to reschedule for next week.
I am now so scared that my post will cause harm to someone reading it. I am just a mess right now.

"Hi everyone 
Thankyou for reading this post, I’ll try to keep it short and to the point as I do need help.
For nearly twenty years I have had the intrusive thought when I’m public I need to pee. This thought has nearly killed me three times as it’s driven me to insanity. Throughout that period, I have always had the fear that I would pee on myself in public if I wasn’t careful.
It’s only this week, I’ve learnt with about 99% confirmation this is a symptom of OCD as the rituals, the checking, the mental anxiety and difficulty socializing and communicating is also very ingrained. 
Strangely enough I found out through watching a channel 4 doc on Bedlam and a young chap on there had a very similar condition which encouraged me to look into this more. Up until now I have never known what to do and developed severe drug, alcohol and pornography addictions even though all of these make the thought worse.
Anyways I’m going off a bit but I’d just like to reach out and see if anyone else has known or experienced this. This thought has really ruined my life up until and kind of made me a laughing stock weirdo so I’m happy to at least know there may be a way out of this.
thanks

"I've been officially diagnosed with OCD in the last few years - but looking back it seems pretty clear that I've had the condition since I was around 5 years old.
Over time I've had OCD rituals that have gradually morphed from counting, tapping, checking, perfectionism and last but unfortunately not least - to contamination issues.
This obviously isn't a scientific poll - but it would be interesting to see roughly what proportion of the OCD-UK community can trace their symptoms back to which approximate age group.

I need to realise that I will always have these tendencies to take things to heart too easily, dwell on inoccuous comments, etc, and alcohol just batters away my defences and leaves me exposed to potentially distressing and disturbing automatic thoughts I would normally deal with pretty well.
I think I need to make a concerted life-change to avoid alcohol and possibly caffeine as well. Does anyone have any experience of stopping drinking in order to cope better with their OCD?

"I honestly think I have hit an all time low. I don't even know if I have OCD. I am pretty certain i'm depressed, though.
I am sick of spending every day looking inwards at myself, looking for things to feel bad about, or to feel strange about. But the fact is, I do genuinely think I am a freak. Everything revolves around sexual things. Fantasies and thoughts growing up.. fantasies currently.. different 'themes' of porn I've watched.. I just feel like a weirdo.
I've always been different. Never really felt as though I fitted into a group of friends at school fully. I am sometimes the joke figure with my current friends.
Like yesterday, me and a couple of friends saw a girl out who was attractive. We all made comments. My two friends are quite good looking lads who have a lot of success with women. I'm not at all, and only ever had one relationship. I joked about fore-fitting my sanity and just going to talk to this girl. My mate a comment, albeit after a few drinks, 'dont bother, you've not exactly got a chance have you?'. I suppose not.
I've never been allowed to do anything my other mates have, down to parents. I'm 21, I don't out socialising at night because of them. Everyday I just note that my life is passing me by. My best years, 18,19,20 have passed, and I have done nothing. My friends are all out there living a bit, and all I do is have arguments with my own head about how much of a freak I am.
I miss my ex terribly. I feel horrible for the stuff I used to put her through, and I swear I would do anything to just even have a conversation with her. But thats not realistic.
Yeah, I am 21, and I am lonely. I honestly am. I try and live every single day as that 'nice guy'. I love helping people, I love seeing people happy, I love people and I used to love life. I would do anything for pretty much any body, and I always sacrifice my own things for the benefit of others. I don't judge any body in life, and I will always try and see the best in people.
But this doesn't subtract from the fact that I feel as though there is a side of me that just wouldn't be accepted by anybody considerably sane. Perhaps I know why my ex decided to leave me for someone else. That hurt at the time, but I understand now, I forgive her.
Today again, I found something to feel weird about. I haven't really stopped thinking about it all day. Its just something that is not what I would consider normal. I just wish I was normal, thats all.
I don't like myself. It sounds strange, but its true. I am who I am, but society never accepts that. You have to be that squeeky clean person. My friend was right. Why should I even consider looking at a girl? For one, I'm butt ugly. For another, I'm too honest a person. I couldn't try and draw a girl into a relationship. It wouldn't be fair on her, going out with someone like me with all this weird stuff.
I just don't enjoy life any more. And realistically, I don't see it getting any better. It's been two years of increasing pain and tiredness.
Sorry for the post, again. I don't even know what I am posting for. I guess I just find a little comfort in typing this out.
I hope you are all well tonight. I really do.","['OCD', 'Thought', 'joy', 'tiredness', 'hope']",['theme'],"['OCD', 'Thought', 'joy', 'tiredness', 'theme', 'hope']",1.0,,1,0,"I am sick of spending every day looking inwards at myself, looking for things to feel bad about, or to feel strange about.

"I am still really struggling with my OCD, since I last posted I have dropped out of college and have been put on medication, I have applied to return to college in September but I still keep feeling very low.
I have a new therapist because the other one got transferred, I know it's silly but I can't help feeling like she has abandoned me.
I often think to myself 'what's the point?' which leads me to feeling suicidal.
I have managed to overcome one of my rituals which I guess I should feel happy about but then I think of all my other rituals and I'm reminded that I still have a long way to go.

"Hi
Currently in South America on a six week holiday and I need some support,
which is very tricky.
I've been travelling with my girlfriend and her brother and we've visited some truly amazing
places in Argentina, Bolivia and Peru. I've contested with various **** from my OCD, initially
a repeated sexual pure O worry and A LOT of agoraphobia around waterfalls, cliffs, open spaces (google Bolivia's Salt Flats, they're off the scale for someone afraid of open spaces.)
and the like.
But I've come through, massively aided by my GF and there's very little I've avoided.
I even gave the OCD voice a 'name', a ridiculous one, as per the advice of a really cool guy we travelled with for a few days. He had a big background in Psychology and his presence helped me a lot.
My worries began to abate and the 'determination' of the OCD to spoil the trip began to falter.
I relaxed a little, shared Facebook pics and began to feel strong.
Then of course, the cliche of 'weak when you're feeling most impervious' came into play.
A new sexual pure O thought took seed one morning, about 4 days ago and has soared. I feel on the verge of panic or tears for most of the time. It's built on an 'if' rumination and it's something I can't face until I'm back in the UK. Horrible, cruel nasty OCD. The re-naming/labelling of the thoughts that seemed to be working so well, it's very tricky now.
Worse, my GF and her brother have gone on a 3 day Inca trek. It's something that would have pushed my fear of heights too far so I've had to stay in town. I now feel alone, anxious and at wits end.
I don't want to wish the last 3 weeks of my trip away but the way I feel, even some exciting diving in two weeks time may be swamped by the ridiculous new Pure-O 'threat.'
I just need a hug... :-(
There's some football on in the pub in an hour and if I can make it there (the main square I have to cross makes me panicky) a tiny bit of moderate drinking will at least relax me slightly. That and distraction of sport.

At work I have been chatting with a nice talkative girl who told me that she also has OCD. We bost shared our experiences. I like her a lot and get on very well with her. She is Polish and lives in my nearest city which i go to virtually every weekend.
Like me she has doubting, harming others, checking, mental rituals etc. I would like to ask her if we could perhaps meet up for a drink one Saturday or even one evening. She has been singhle for 4 months. I like her and I think she likes me as she asked me to draw a heart on her apron while she was wearing it the other day, and she tries to get close to me when she says something. Do you think she fancies me? Its her birthday on Monday so I might get her a card and write it in that something like """"""""here is my email address"""""""" or """"""""here is my mobile number"""""""", rather than ask her to her face because I worry about what the answer might be.

"Hi, i am new to this and seeking advice.
so thought this was the best way to seek information and share things that occur with me.
I wasnt too sure if at first i believed i could have OCD, but it became apparent most recently when i moved into my own place.
I have several things that are clearly a bit odd it may seem and my parnter suggested i ask someone about it.
> I have to line all the remotes in line with one another, in height order from left to right. They must be square to everything.
> We have a square coffee table, in which i bought all square coasters so that everything again be square and aline with everything.
> All my books are in catogry order, height and all lined with spines facing and writing reading downwards.
> All my Dvd's are in again catogry order from Actors, to theme.
> All my Cd's have to be in order, Artist alphabetical and in order of release date.
> All my furniture is square to the walls and alines. Nothing is at an angle.
> My clothing is all in order, football shirts all grouped in team, age and all face same direction.
> In the bathroom, the soap dish, combs and all shower products are inline, and all again at straight angles.
> At work, all my stationary, notepads and folders are all in line, tidy and organised and labelled.
If something is out of line or unorganised, i have to fix realine it or redo something. I've sat there as my daughter mixes up my dvd's or knocks them out of line, i become frustrated and then have to move them back instantly.
I don't think there is anything too serious and im sure im no where near as worried as many other people who suffer with sever OCD, but i seek answers and need confimation on how to understand it really.

"As an OCD 'checker' one of my rituals is to check my door to excess when I am about to go to bed or to leave the house for any prolongued period of time (e.g work). Unfortunately I live in a block of flats where any noise echoes around the building. Last night, I found a note on my door mat. The note read as follows:
Before I ring the Council regarding noise pollution again, around these flats, I would like to ask you KINDLY to keep your late nite/early morning door banging to a minimum! This keeps waking me up, I work shifts! And it is really p**sing me off! I dont want any hatred in my stay here but your door banging keeps waking me. STOP IT!
This person left no name, flat number etc. so I am unable to trace who it is. The really annoying thing for me is that I have no means to respond; if only this person would make themselves know so I have at least a chance to explain the situation. The flats themselves are generally noisy; it is not unusual to hear shouting in the corridors or loud music playing in the early hours of hte morning. The stair are wooden and every footstep can be heard when it is quiet.
Has anyone been in this situation? Any help or advice would be greatly appreciated.
Just for info, I was diagnosed in 2006 and have undergone two course of CBT since this time.

I try to tell myself that these actions were the result of a debilitating illness. That it's not my fault; I was born with a certain predisposition to OCD and this was triggered by life events.

"Last night my mum told me that my cousin is pregnant, and due to one of my nastier OCD themes being triggered by pregnant women - I have just had to cancel ALL Christmas parties with my family. Also, for the last few hours I have even been thinking """"""""maybe she'll lose it / get an abortion"""""""" because I wouldn't have to deal with any OCD spikes / triggers that come as a result.
I feel awful for this, yet I know I only felt that way cos of a fear of hurting it somehow.
A lot of my family are getting on now, so maybe for some this is their last Christmas - and we only really see them at Christmas time anyway. When the OCD kicked in about a fear of harming kids I had to avoid such gatherings, engagement parties, christenings - the lot meaning I've missed out on my cousins special moments. Also over the last few years, until my youngest cuz turned 16 I have been a complete stranger cos I couldn't be around them. There has been one year (last year) where I was able to go, and now - with this announcement I am going to skip yet more years of quality family time.
I know that by avoiding these parties, all I am doing is strengthening the OCD, but then I simply do not have the mental tools to be able to cope meaning if I went, and I suffered a spike / episode / panic attack then the ruminations and depression will last for years afterwards. Some of you may know that I have a tendancy to get stuck on the same issues for years, and I am not prepared to put myself into a situation that involves my family.
Its a tactical avoidance, of course originally a safety behaviour which went out of control hence now being a habit.
With the party only a week away, there is no way I can prepare myself.
God knows what it would be like when the kid is born - more christenings and parties to avoid but at least I could set myself a 9 month deadline to overcome this.

"I've read into Steven Phillipson's articles on pure o, which is what i have had for a few years. I'm attempting to do the type of erp he suggests where i turn my spikes into larger and more intense spikes to create MORE anxiety than my spike originally caused.
I feel like this is the best type of exposure for me for a few reasons, i've tried the """"""""antidote"""""""" or basically just saying, """"""""so what if my worry is true"""""""" and it doesn't really work for me because i always feel like i'm just ignoring the anxiety or postponing it instead of facing it head on or experiencing it. """"""""Let it be there"""""""" doesn't work for the same reason. Ive also tried postponing but i don't seem to be very good at it because i cannot maintain my thought process to keep it on my spikes, my mind gets distracted too easily and i'm off thinking about something else in a matter of minutes when i'm trying to maintain my anxiety to habituate.
I'm getting frustrated and i feel like i'm doing something wrong. I've decided to try his other suggestion which is to turn my spikes into large ones. This has worked because i can definitely make my spikes worse, my imagination is pretty used to doing that. I spike a few times a day so it seems perfect because i can turn my 4-5 spikes into large ones that cause a lot of anxiety in a matter of minutes.
My question is, since i am trying the self help and haven't had a therapist actually tell me how to do this, i'm wondering if i'm doing it the right way.

For example if I see a knife I will say to myself in my head """"""""go on, stab her with it"""""""" but then say """"""""stop being so stupid, you dont want to stab her with it"""""""". Does anyone else have these discussions with themselves? I am now scared that these conversations I have with myself are not actually me, but """"""""voices"""""""". I can see myself getting caught up in havning discussions with myself all the time now trying to justify its me and not some """"""""voices""""""""
The woman's voice I heard last night has really scared me cause I am pretty sure if you start hearing voices its a sign that you are becomming psycotic. On the flip-side I was trying to get to sleep and so might have been slightly slipping into unconciousness and experiencing the effects of """"""""nodding off"""""""".
I had just had an argument with my fiance before going to sleep too and this is worrying me that the voice came cause my adrenaline was up from the argument and would it come again next time. Plus my fiance had managed to get to sleep before me and woke up with a start with her arms out defending herself like she was having a nightmare that she was being attacked - this happened a couple of minutes before I heard the woman's voice. This scared me too cause I started analysing everything I had done for the previous 20 seconds or so to make sure I hadnt done anything to her.
I am trying my best not to dwell on it too much cause my GP told me when I went to see him that I over analyse things, but the thought that I dont have OCD and that I am actually psychotic is terrifying.

"Hi
This is my first post as I have only joined today. I discovered OCD 5 years ago when my anxiety got so bad causing depression which led me to see a psychiatrist and finally the pieces came together. My OCD seems to have changed and evolved and It started I believe when I was 13. Also my OCD has gone from having compoltions and rituals to just Pure O.
Episodes have included
1.Fear of death - Age 13 effected me for a couple of months.
2.Lock checking when leaving my first car parked up and parents house, could take up to 30 mins to assure everythings was ok, involving unlocking and relocking. Pulling on the handle and counting to 5 in my head. Age 17
3.Checking switches are actually off including lights, would actually leave the house and have to come back. Fear I might of got switches wet and that a member of my family might get eletric shock. Age 16-17
4. Fear I would cheat on my first proper longterm girlfriend - Age 17
5. Fear that if not say a prayer at bedtime something bad would happen to a family member - Age 21
6. Fear that I was Gay and didnt fancy my girlfriend - This caused first case of depression and effected me for months, maybe a year all because I saw a guy oneday that I had seen before and never thought anything but this day I thought he is good looking and that was it my mind went it to overdrive and felt real bad anxiety I thought my world was ending. Age 21
Back then I didnt know why I felt this way its would effect me for many hours a day. This fear eventually subsided and things kinda went back to normal although it was always in the background.
A few years and girlfriends later (age 27) I finally met a girl I knew and hoped would be my partner for life things were going great until one day my fears of being gay came back when I saw anouther good looking guy even though there was years in between where I must have seen other good looking guys and never caused the same anxiety. With help I finally discovered OCD and CBT and fears of being gay are always in the background sometimes really bad, sometimes its like its gone and Im cured.
I hate it but I know I must fight it the only compultions I have nowadays is I like making lists for everything I fear If I dont write it down I will forget it even though I have a good memory.

I suffer with depression and anxiety to a degree and also believe Im an OCD person, this has got worse over the years to the point now where I know Im counting/checking constantly.

"This is a real situation that happened to me very many years ago.
I had been given a job I really wanted, the opportunity to become an account executive with my own portfolio of clients to advise and supply  with appropriate insurance products.
But I was given a target sales figure that I needed to achieve in the calendar year. 
This really bugged me - it seemed a very large figure. I started to worry that I wouldn't achieve anything near it - then an anxiety spiral developed - I would lose my job, let my wife down, we might be unable to pay our mortgage, lose the house, my wife might leave me........ 
I couldn't sleep, I felt I'll, my head ached, my muscles cramped. 
I got up - took a detached view and decided to see the situation in a different light. 
I knew I could do this job, got on well with people. If the products found favour, and we're at the right price, I knew I could sell them. 
I knew I was organised, could schedule my work to make the visits needed. 
So, if I didn't make the target, it wouldn't be for any likely failure on my part. 
And if I did not suit the job, at least I tried, and could get a job doing something else well before I might lose this job. 
All the anxiety fell away, as I could see the risk of my worst fears - the catastrophic ones - were actually really unlikely and I could take steps anyway to protect our income and home. 
I went back to bed, slept soundly, woke up feeling well and the issue never troubled me again - I applied the methods I had learned from study to stop worrying. 
When we worry or ruminate, we solve nothing and make ourselves upset distressed and will likely think negative catastrophic thoughts that throw more fuel on the fires of distress and anxiety. 
And let's remember the wonderful serenity prayer - let's change the things we can (for the better), accept the things we can't, and have the wisdom to know the difference. 
We should now be able to see that in OCD rumination is actually feeding the core belief  that falsehood or exaggeration is trying to make us believe. 
It cannot and will not make us feel better, only worse. And it will feed the anxiety cycle.
When we feel the urge to ruminate we need to stop - just remind ourselves of the above - then get busy on something worthwhile.

"Hi all,
My quality of life is very, very poor at the moment, and I am struggling to diagnose the symptoms. As of now, I have been awake for the last 27.5 hours, and I don't feel too bad at all. I'll probably go to bed tonight, and altogether, perhaps be awake for a total of 40 hours. I have seen my several GP's up to now, all of which have been totally useless, and insist on lengthy consultations and painstaking bureaucracy going into the weeks and months before referring me to a specialist - but I need I help now, and have done for a long time!
The real thing that is mystifying me about my symptoms is that I can't pinpoint what's wrong with me. In fact, I seem to have symptoms which seems to encompass Panic Disorder, Clinical Depression, Bi-Polar Disorder, OCD (the Pure O type), and perhaps other suprises thrown in. It's a blender of symptoms. My symptoms are the following:
• Inexplicable sleepless nights; sudden insomnia (like today)
• Spirits are constantly down; am sullen
• Finding difficulty motivating myself; withdrawn
• Continuous cycle of anger/guilt
• Very emotional/rollercoaster of feelings/shed a few tears for no particular reasons
• At times, speaking/articulating coherence is affected
• Fluctuating confidence levels
• Temperamental; irritable for no discernible reason/can't explain why
• Am rather obsessive; I overexert myself unnecessarily for trivial things
• Don’t want to live anymore; purposeless of life
• Feelings of helplessness/worthlessness
• When excited/happy, adrenaline pumping and am jumpy; talk fast
• Can be very nervous sometimes/confidence swings; self-doubt
• Paradoxically, it would be WRONG to think I am a timid and shy person. I actually can come across as too confident and outspoken. I am humurous and always talking, but I guess I tend to appear superconfident to hide the fact that I am not confident at all...it's like a mask on mask.
• Pulsing/shooting feelings/sensations in my head
• Palpitations; breathlessness; head spinning; lack of thinking coherence; blank mind
• Clouded thinking; inability to think coherently
• Lack of self-respect; dignity
• Complete pessimist; look far into the future and worry
• Lack of security; constantly think I’m going to get fired from my job
• Can be reclusive (I find solace by being by myself); but can be the heart of party, a true socialite
• Panic Attacks (sometimes very severe); trembling; sweating even though sitting down; suspicious; paranoid
• Ruminations/having terrible uncontrollable thoughts
• It is also affecting my professional life - I have been forced to go from full-time work to part-time since I was on the point of a nervous breakdown...I was having panic attacks in the workplace, was reading sentences but could'nt understand what they were saying, etc. and towards the end, was rushed to a medical surgery in which I had a massive panic attack in front of the doctor.
I am 20 years old, and retrospectively, have been having problems since my early teens. But I have been living in denial for far too long, and simply can't take it anymore. I have a life to live, but can't seem to live it. The above list looks horrendous, I know, but it does come in peaks and valleys. For a few days, I can feel invinicible and superconfident, and others days, my confidence levels go through the floor boards and I can't even get out of bed. Sometimes, I feel relatively normal, but those times are getting less and less these days.
I'm due to see the Doc this Thursday...let's see how it goes.
So can anybody interpret the above symptoms/or have exprienced it themselves?
Anything you have to say is very much appreciated and worth its weight in Gold! :original:
Many thanks
RG

"Hi peoples! How you all doing?
I want to know what symptoms other people have. I'll write what symptoms I've had & other forumers can write theirs...
Here is my menu of symptoms. (all served with salad & root vegetables)
>Talking plus argueing with oneself & being idealogically controlled by that imaginary person.
>Highly organised """"""""luck making"""""""" rituals that have a whole back story behind them that makes logical sense.
>Random fears that pop up for a weeks then dissepate then return months/years later. (Ex: Asbestos contamination)
>Controlling thoughts that ensure you do things a certain way EVERY hour of EVERY day. (Ex: avoiding pavemen cracks)
>The seeming inability to learn & progress with subjects you enjoy. The facts never sink in & pannicky feelings arise.
>Feeling anxious & confused about expressing yourself. Feel anxious buying music, dvds, sharing your opinions etc.
>Needing constant reassurance about your fears from people.
>Not being able to enjoy pleasurable activities (hobbies, sex, dancing) freely, one must also add imagination to enjoy it.
>Making countless mistakes in simple things even when you KNOW what your doing & have FULL concentration.
>Being emotionally confused to a point where you REALLY don't know what you feel as the feelings change every minute.
>Not feeling connected to own age group. You feel old when your young. (Ex: I felt I was """"""""used up"""""""" when I was 17)
>Delayed reactions to events & situations (not related to slow reflexes) Its like theres a delay in your mind & emotions.
>Can't seem to """"""""manage"""""""" time. Feel anxious that there is no time, so it confuses the brain further.
I'm still trying to assertain wether I had OCD to supplement my talks with a professional. Overtime I'm realising that my mind must have been playing tricks on me. I've notcied that the older I get the more I feel disconnected with people, the less I seem to learn, the less I seem to feel & the more I have to use my imagination to enjoy life (sort of living life via proxy) I'm wondering if other people have this general trend going on. Any comments, thoughts welcome
Francesco.

"Just thought I'd post on here to update on how I'm doing as I feel I've made a lot of progress and wanted to share as it might give others a bit of hope.
As some of you may know I've had OCD for a few years now and the themes have varied to focus on health issues, sexuality and gender identity worries, harm issues and more recently worries to do with my relationship.
I've been engaged to my partner since 2011 but have put off getting married all this time due to overwhelming doubts that have appeared whenever I've tried to plan it, such as worrying whether I'm making the right choice or whether he is the """"""""right"""""""" person for me, to questioning my own feelings and levels of attraction.
Well I can now report that I've put in a lot of work in overcoming this and I've managed to buy a wedding dress, rings and various other bits and bobs and we have booked a date for 7th May 2020 and have paid the first big instalment towards it. I do still have horrendous doubts but overall I'm very happy about it.
Hopefully I'll manage to carry on as I have been doing and not give into any compulsive urges.

"Hello
I am new to this forum.
It looks like I have OCD for some years (actually doctor said it is since I was born :S)
I have been struggling all life with therapy but therapist didnt actually call this OCD - he said I was paranoid, instead...
Now I really got something I never had before - washing hands compulsively! yes...
So I went to a doctor that prescribed Anafranil 75mg and Alzen 100mg
Any one doing this medication?
So far dry mouth, and my feet are sooo cold...
The best!

"How do you deal with repressed anger that has lasted a lifetime and is triggered by new events?
How do you respond to the events without letting ghosts of the past cloud your perception?
How do you express anger calmly and assertively in social situations? How do you say something to someone without letting the anger blow up and go out of control?
How do you defuse anger and process anger outside of any situation? How do you deliberately trigger it and process it? How do you turn that off again?
My anger usually leads to loads of negative and angry ruminations which then turn into OCD and depression. The effects seem to last up to a fortnight afterward and probably longer. I had a negative Christmas emotionally and I am still reaping the rewards of that Trying to get back on track. Need a bit of help especially with this issue, thanks.

"Have been suffering with my contamination side for ages now, as some of you well now one of my ruminations is that i am petrified of becoming infected with something terrible
Well after visiting local clinic i had my mind put at rest recently only to have it spiral out of control big time yesterday.
I got home from work to find my convalesing cat had got out and got her self stuck on the roof further on from ours - quite distressing in itself so kept dashing out of the house in my bare feet and back into the bed room which is in the loft to try and coax her back in.
After much distress to my self and probably BB she finally realised she could get back in i noticed i had cut my foot ( on some glass or summat ) so i took my self off to the local casualty dept to have my fears put to rest re infection of some kind, also xrayed to make sure no foreign bodies lodged in it, glued to heal the wound, i have to say i found a wonderful health worker who when i explained about my ocd that i liked having it written down as confirmation that i couldnt be contaminated in that way ( a crutch if you like - but helps me non the less ) obliged without batting an eyelid and wished me well in my treatment i am currently awaiting from our local mental health services
It was reasurring to myself that not everyone looks at you like you are daft when explaining your symptoms
Damn cat however is now grounded lol until she is insured which will be after friday once she has had the all clear from the vets
Even though i have been told i am free from any infections of any kind i still use my hand cleaner in copius amounts and still fret about getting or giving any

"Hi all,
hope you are having the best day you possibly can :original:
About 2 wks ago I was put onto Mitazipine (15mg for 1 wk upped to 30mg taken at night) for the OCD/Anxiety/Depression and started at the Accute treatment team within the local hospital.
The Mitazipine REALLY did not agree with me and the first night I went onto the higher dose I passed out after going to the loo and cut my eye open (another trip to A&E for 5 stitches!), had to go and have my heart checked as well but all came out ok (although I worried/ruminated about that for a while after).
After seeing the GP last Tuesday I have now got to change meds AGAIN! She wants me to have 1 week to kind of detox, I stopped taking the Mitazipine last Sunday and hope and pray next Tuesday will see the start of something new that will help me.
I am really feeling it at the mo without anything, Int Thtgs are defo worse, anxiety is very high, I cry much more easily if that makes sense and rumination is much more difficult to control.
It feels though I am stuck, I don't want to be like this anymore, its grinding me down so much, my life is just one constant struggle with thoughts, mental checking, trying not to do it, frustration, fear etc. I only want to get back on track, but I can't do it alone!
Is this nightmare ever going to end? I pray to God every night that it will (and I mean that).
I am going to see a new private counsellor/cbt therapist next Monday, but its always waiting about!
I also have to say that the NHS round here is Very poor in some aspects, even my GP said if you can...pay for it!
Any words of advice or people who have been though this would be a great help at the mo,

"Hi,
I found this website and forum about a week ago- I've never joined a web forum before so apologies in advance for any bad netiquette- it's entirely unintentional. I've had OCD since I was about 9 (I'm 24 now) but for the last few months it's been geting steadily worse. I've tried to ignore it because I just want to be normal and I haven't ever told anone about it because I think they'll think I'm mad or evil. My life has been full of rituals since I was a little girl- there's a voice in my head that tells me bad things will happen to me or people i care about if I don't do certain things. I try to hide it when I 'm out with friends but at home all I do is go back and forward touching things, tapping things- I even count the number of beats in songs on my ipod because they sometimes seem to match the bad thoughts so I have to keep replaying the starts of songs until it's okay.
I have contamintaion OCD and my biggest fear is that I'll contract HIV and pass it on to everyone I meet. A few weeks ago I developed a bad throat and weird rash that still haven't gone away. So six weeks ago I decided to get myself tested. I'm stupid because rationally I know that I'm incredibly low risk but as soon as I try and think like this the OCD thoughts kick in and scream over the rational voice. Anyway, I got tested and it was negative but I wasn't relieved at all. For a start I lied to the nurse so that she would think I was at a higher risk than I was in order to get the reults back quicker. Now I'm convinced that as punishment for lying God will give me HIV anyway. Also, the nurse told me that the incubation period for HIV is 12 weeks so as soon as I got the result I though that I must still be incubating the virus and will have to get tested again and the anxiety is just eating away at me. I think I see infected blood everywhere- I cook meals and then throw them away because I think I see specks of blood on them (two nights ago an entire lasagne went in the bin because I thought someone had infected it with HIV).
It's worse when I'm out with friends because I pretend that I'm not having these thoughts. Recently I was out for coffee with some friends and I thought there was blood on the spoon but I wanted to be normal so I used it anyway and now I'm in such a panic- I keep thinking about it but rationally what was I suppossed to do- tell my friends that I wasn't going to stir in my sugar because the spoon was infected with HIV! I don't understand- even writing that I know that it makes no sense but I can't accept that. The OCD thoughts tell me that I'm damned for lying and I'll get HIV as punishment. I can't even accept when my doctor tells me that the rash and sore throat are nothing serious and will go away of their own accord- and stressing about them is only making it worse but I can't stop checking if the rash is spreading.
Anyways, I'm at university and have contacted the counselling service- there's a wait of about two weeks for an appointment but I need to do something. I've never told anyone about my OCD and I dont know what to expect from counselling- this is is actually the first time I've sat down and written about what goes on in my head and I apologise if it's a bit all over the place and long-winded.
I've had a look at some other threads in this forum and I know I'm not the only person with HIV contamination fears- it's nice to know I'm not alone even if that doesn't help me deal with it.
Lots of luck and support to you all in trying to cope with this horrible OCD,

at the start my ocd was too bad, i can sort of remember being one of the messed up kids in class, my mind was filled with unwanted sexual thoughts in year 6, which i then turned into jokes to help me deal with it... anyway, all those thoughts had also led me to a girlfriend which went on and off for about 2 years, she left school in like year 8 or something, and one day i met up with her, and she had been doing drugs, binge drinking, and had had sex at least over 20/30 times, and that day ended with a kiss... and we got caught by one of her mums friends, who then told her mum, who then told my mum, and then my mum gave me a lecture on how i can get stds, so now i think i have herpies or something...
ok, i have sort of gone off of the topic about my dad and more of a life story, but im feeling better now
anyway
i think it was last year or something, or maybe even the start of this year? i have a breakdown/break through where i told one of my friends and my dad that i had ocd, very bad move... i think my dad thinks im faking it, for i dont know what reason, and he even used it against me, like one time in a resturant i was apparently acting energetic, and he said something like """"""""alex, your acting like compulsive behaviours"""""""" infront of his slut girlfriend, and my sisters who i havnt told i had ocd, and he said it in the sickest most evil way you could say it, i have never forgiven him for that
ok, lets try and describe how my dad has been for the last few years or something...
well, all he does is work, sleep, and uhh... no idea?
he spends at least 3/4 of the time he is at home sleeping, rather than spending any time with me or my sisters, or even his new baby (who could eat a full happy meal before he was 1 year old)
my dad is unreliable, everything i have to go to, or he something that involves him getting somewhere, he is always late, your probably thinking, so? 10 minutes late isnt that bad? well, yesterday after band rehersal, he was 1 hour 45 minutes late, on my work experience, he was around 2 hours late picking me up, oh, and dont forget this is in the hot sun, with flies flying around you constantly
he blames everything that goes wrong on someone else, if he is doing something, and ***** it up, he will probably end up blaming me for not asking him if he needed help... even when i had, and he said no
he can never give me a straight answer, i asked him on monday if i can have my band members around for a band practice before we have out first ever performance, they were meant to stay friday night, and then we would all go to the performance from my place, but, BUT after our weekly band practice today, they had to come over to my place for a bit because their parants were unable to pick them up on time at the school, so whats that? 3 days to think about it, does he give me an answer before they go? no, now once he has finally finished watching a moving at 11:00pm, im not allowed to talk while he is watching movies, or everyone goes off, him, his slut, and my older sister... then every 30 seconds they have a full conversation, so anyway, finally, the night before i am meant to have to band members over for a band practice he finally gives me an answer, no... he said no, well to be honest, there is no ******* way i can now contact my band members and tell them they cant come over tomorrow, its 11pm at night, the night before they can come over, come on, but i dont really care, they are coming over whether he likes it or not, he said we shouldof been organised, he has never heard my band play, and whats wrong with a last minute band practice?
but the biggest thing i am ****** off at is how he left it to the night before at 11pm
anyway, lets get back to my ocd?
over the last 6 months, i have noticed it has gotten a lot worse, everything i do now is affected by ocd, the majority of things is counted like this 1 2 3 4 4, if that doesnt feel right i have to continue 1 2 3 4 4 1 2 3 4 4 1 2 3 4 4 1 2 3 4 4 1 2 3 4 4 4 dont ask me about the pattern anyway, i do that until it feels right, which is usually never, and i eventually just get so annoyed that i actually just leave with the bad feeling and the thoughts going through my head...
my mental state also isnt holding up, just before in the shower i just started crying, i just cant take this any more... i just want to get away from my family, my alcoholic mother, the worst father in the world and his slut and fat kid, my abusive sister, my younger sister is ok... except she was obviously affected by the divorce to, because her emotional state is very unstable, i just wish i could just be on my own, leave school, get a job in a recording studio, and live happily every after, but, of course, that isnt very likely for a 15 year old kid...
i dont really know what else to write... except, no, i havnt had any treatment for my ocd, except for when i went to the school counsellor for about half of a term, but that didnt help much, and i also looked weird going to the school counsellor
and also please dont tell me to hang in there, that phrase really wont help much at the moment...","['hope', 'urge', 'Compulsive behavior', 'Treatment', 'Thought', 'OCD']",[unwanted sexual thoughts],"['urge', 'OCD', 'Treatment', 'Thought', 'Compulsive behavior', 'hope']",1.0,1.0,1,1,
"Hi everybody: I'm new to this board. I've had OCD for as far back as I can remember. It mostly centers around religious themes. I am a Christian, but do not feel close to God because of my OCD which began with blasphemous thoughts. With medication these thoughts are not as troublesome as they used to be, and the handwashing rituals I used to have are almost non-existent.
My main problem now is magical thinking, punishment and guilt. I feel as if everything I enjoy is sin and has the potential of becoming an idol. A partial list: movies, certain TV shows, secular music (mostly Celtic music, Andrea Bocelli, Sarah Brightman) and, most of all, my huge collection of fashion magazines and catalogues (Vogue, Harper's Bazaar and Red).
I recently lost my sweet husband after a lengthy illness. Now, in addition to profound grief, I am torturing myself that it was my fault because I did not get rid of my magazine collection. I kept thinking that if I got rid of these things, that perhaps God would heal my husband. My therapist, who is a Christian, said it was magical thinking and that the magazines and any of the above things had nothing to do with his illness and that keeping them or getting rid of them would not make any difference at all. Even though I know this to be true, I can't help but get stuck and doubt that now I will never know if he could have been healed as I did not get rid of the journals.
The issue of the magazines goes way back before I even knew my husband. When I was 20 years old I developed thyroid cancer, which was curable. I was sure that it was somehow a punishment for the blasphemous thoughts. When I got home from hospital I was overcome with the thought that I must get rid of something that I really liked in order to prevent a recurrence, even though the doctors assurred me that all the cancer was removed in the surgery, and that I did not even need further treatment. I was not convinced, however, and I threw out my whole collection of mags. I really missed them and quickly built up another collection, but whenever I would go through type of trial, out would go the magazines. This went on for years, until I finally saw the therapist back in 1995 (when my husband became ill) and was put on Zoloft and Xanax. He also firmly told me not to throw out my magazines.
I would welcome any feedback on the above. It's almost as if I think I can """"""""control"""""""" what God allows by getting rid of things I enjoy. I've always liked fashion, and could probably be considered a """"""""fashionista"""""""" albeit not a sleazy one. In addition to magical thinking, is getting rid of the mags or anything for that matter, to keep bad things from happening, considered a ritual?
Please, anyone, I would appreciate hearing from you as I wish I could have gone with my husband. The guilt and doubt are killing me. I loved him so very much.
Thanks for reading this.
Kathy
PS: I got the idea fashion and fashion magazines were wrong as I listened to a lot of legalistic teachings at the beginning of my Christian walk. They said fashion was too worldly and the styles in the mags too provocative. As I said, even though I collect fashion mags and enjoy style, I have never been tempted to dress trashy.","['Medication', 'Rituals', 'grief', 'urge', 'Treatment', 'rash', 'OCD', 'guilt', 'joy', 'Thought']",['theme'],"['urge', 'Treatment', 'rash', 'Rituals', 'joy', 'Thought', 'grief', 'theme', 'Medication', 'OCD', 'guilt']",1.0,1.0,1,1,It mostly centers around religious themes.
"I thought I'd share another theme as I have more than one playing at the moment.
When I was about 11 my mum was friends with a woman who had 2 girls aged 3 and 6 months.
I used to spend a lot of time at theirs and on about 2 occasions had them on my own. During one of these times I remember making up a game so the 3 yr old would touch my hair but I dont think this was sexual ... Even tho I knew I didn't want anyone to find out.
That's all fine... But in 2006 and now I've had the crippling worry I fancied her or I touched her. I have one 'true' memory of wanting to cuddle her on top of me and Im concerned why?!
I know (pretty sure) I never touched her 'down there' or had her touch me.
This is crippling. My therapist told me I probably felt a mothering feeling rather than anything sexual??! I also remember around a slightly earlier age laying on top of one of my life size dolls and it feeling good but at the time I didn't know why it did or why I was doing it!
I'm so worried I abused her. I can't stop thinking about it.
I also used to hang around with a 5 yr old (we lived in a small cul d sac) when I was 10 and her dad would bathe her in front of me but if anything I was uncomfortable and don't recall doing anything. And this 5 yr old would be alone with me alot.
Another weird memory is that at this age I was fascinated with a cartoon in a book of a pregnant woman and I used to pretend like I was her partner and was gonna help her through labour (?!?) and looking back the memory feels sexual.
Argh I just can't stop thinking I abused this girl.
Actually...I know I didn't touch her. My disgust is that I wanted her on top of me!!! Why!!? Was I turned on?!
I think this was around the age I discovered how to make myself feel good alone...if you know what I mean and that adds to my worry!! Though I have no memory that it was over children!!!!!
I'm female and 29 now. I didn't kiss a boy til I was 14 and didn't really know what sex was until I was in secondary school (11-12) just after this.","['Thought', 'feeling good', 'disgust']",['theme'],"['disgust', 'Thought', 'theme', 'feeling good']",1.0,,1,0,
"After months of searching and looking for answers on this horrible disorder, i,ve finally decided to seek out some help. I,ve looked for so many reasons to believe this could not possibly happen to me or that something else is responsible for where this disorder has taken me. In a few short months i cannot begin to tell you the damage this has caused. The site here has allowed me to search and source for answers and many questions that I finally realized I cannot fix this myself. Was last november that everything seemed to go sideways with death of a younger sister from H1N1. According to many sites and a number of helpful hints and posts from OCDUK its become hard to deny that ocd has taken over for me. The death of my sister was an initial trigger to the uglier side of ocd. Somewhat pointless to list all the events and rituals that i,ve experienced as nothing would be a surprise for most sufferers. For me the initial challenge once i accepted ocd was real was to find a professional capable of diagnosing and more importantly, treating the disorder. My first appointment will be Wednesday, 2500 kms from home. Yup 2500, ocd was a wonderful trip the last few months for sure. I certainly don,t expect one appointment to fix me but I sure hope this gives me the first step to controlling or better identifying how this disorder operates. Many of you here have posted that this can be beaten....I sure hope so. I will keep you posted as to how this all goes later this week.
Thank you to all who have posted and esp Ashley. I suspect that without Ashley we may not have OCDUK to fall back on for support even if somedays its just to lose your thoughts in the posts of others.","['Rituals', 'surprise', 'fall', 'Thought', 'site', 'hope', 'OCD']",[],"['surprise', 'OCD', 'site', 'fall', 'Thought', 'Rituals', 'hope']",,1.0,0,0,
"A few years ago, I had my worst OCD/depression breakdown to date. It started at the end of January, peaked in mid February (causing me to check into a mental hospital for a couple of weeks, due to the nature of my harm theme), and finally ended in mid May. Because of this, I have come to dread January and February ever year because it reminds me of how sick I was. I had another small bout with OCD in 2013 but got through it without any professional intervention, 2014 was fine, but in January of 2015 spent another 10 days in the hospital and did a round of antidepressants. With January around the corner, I can kind of feel it creeping up on me, and I'm very frustrated. I've dealt with OCD for 12 years and should KNOW what this is and how to handle it by now. What's awful is that I can never guess how bad it's going to be. I could be totally over it by next week, or I could be in bad shape. It's the worst form of self-sabatoge I've ever dealt with. I keep telling myself to just go through the motions of daily life and eat and sleep well so that I don't get too physically exhausted. Otherwise, I don't know what to do. I can't just LET the depression take over again. I have a new apartment and new responsibilities that just won't allow me to check out of life. I've considered at least going to my primary care doctor to get some antidepressants, but considering that I never stay on them longer than 2-3 months at a time, I don't know if it's even worth it.

"Hi Everyone!
Firstly I'd like to apologise to you all for not using the forum for some time and only now that I'm seemingly nearing a relapse that I have realised how important it is top stay connected with you all - I just got lazy.
Having finished my latest round of therapy some 4 months ago, and having not confessed in that time to my wife (which was the ultimate goal), my OCD seems to have morphed (as we know it so often does) around anxiety. I feel anxious nearly all the time, for no apparent reason. I dread everything that I do, from getting a cup of tea to playing with my children. It stems from work, where I deal with customers all day, and there I get some disabling attacks of anxiety, all surrounding paranoia of what people think of me, and feelings of always having to prove myself, not to mention continuously ruminating about the public's behavior where I work. I work part time and finish by 1pm, but due to the high levels of anxiety I feel totally shattered when I get home.
My OCD has also hit on a new spike, which has broadsided my progress. 2 weeks ago, my wife and I took our 2 children to spend a few days with our parents back home in Portsmouth (we live in West London and have done happily for 7 years). Upon returning after such a great time with all our family, I started to get feelings of homesickness, my first ever after 7 years away! Of course, my OCD picked up on this and just kept the feeling going. It got better last week, however I have had a bad bout of it today and I am feeling a little bit scared by it. I know deep down that I don't want to move back down to the south coast as I know we love it here, however I just can't feel that way and whenever I walk around our neighborhood it no longer feels the same - I know I am TRYING to feel a certain way and this does not work on demand! It has left me feeling totally lost and confused and has hit me for six really. The 'doubting' feeling in my stomach is there a lot and although I know from my therapy to ignore those feelings, I just want to feel happy living where we do again,. which I know I am. My OCD is getting hold of this and demanding we move back home or to the country and it is scary.
I'm sorry for the long winded post and thank you for reading. I wonder if anyone else has experienced these spikes? If there's any way I can help any of you on this post please let me know.
Best Wishes,
Matthew","['behavior', 'anxiety', 'anxiety', 'OCD']",['spike'],"['behavior', 'spike', 'anxiety', 'OCD']",1.0,,1,0,"My OCD has also hit on a new spike, which has broadsided my progress. 2 weeks ago, my wife and I took our 2 children to sp"
"Hi All,
You have probably seen me posting asking for help and reassurance over the last week or so. Well sadly i am still very anxious and not in a good place at the minute and ruminations are constant.(thanks to those who have helped me)
The thoughts are mainly about harm of loved ones and sexuality doubts, that go round and round and round, as you can appreciate this is destroying me.
i need some advice please i have undergone CBT but all the things i learnt are really difficult to put into perspective and because of what is going on and i am also doubting some of the things i learnt are actually going to work.
Ocd makes my outlook very black or white and i struggling to make sense of things that before have made perfect sense.
I know the thoughts are just thoughts, i know i wouldnt do anything the thought content is about.
i am not sure what to do anymore, i have another appointment with the docs this morning what should i do, what should i say i need some more help","['OCD', 'Thought']",['rumination'],"['rumination', 'Thought', 'OCD']",1.0,,1,0,
"Hi there


I am an old member, but I have not been on here fore a while.

I suffer from OCD - pure O. My main theme is my relationship with my husband. Do I love him or not. ROCD, as some like to call it, but it is OCD no matter the theme.

I have been so well for a couple of years, and when I have had relapses, they have been manageble and mainly with health issues. I am on 200 mg of Sertraline and have no plans of stopping and certainly not now.
I have a pretty stressful time at work at the moment, I love my work, but there is just too much to do. I will not say that I suffer from stress, I think I have managed ok, but I guess this is
important as back ground info.
Maybe I should also mention, that I was pretty premenstrual last week
Last week I had a fight with my husband - a normal fight about economy.
I don't know if you know this; when we have a fight, I always asume, that this means that he will leave me. I am very bad at focusing on the real subject

However, we had some good talks and found our way. Friday was fine, and the argument was completely over, and I just had to adjust.
Saturday morning though, anxiety hits me!
I think I managed to think """"""""this could lead to OCD - i must not let the worries, that we are not ment to be together take me!""""""""
And there it went, my whole body was filled with anxiety, my heart rythm increased, my stomach turned, I felt like throwing up and so on - you know the drill.
My mind went racing, and all the old, well known thoughts returned.
It has been pretty much this way ever since. The evenings are ok - my husband is very understandig and has a good understanding of how my mind works. The best thing is to lie, with him holding me, watching som odd, meaningles tv-show. Then the anxiety is almost gone, and I feel kind of safe. (untill of course I begin to ask myself, if I really feel safe, is this really love.
I am also very tired and have no trouble going to sleep. and I sleep ok.
But I am so scared of the mornings; when I awake I have a few moments of ease and then the anxiety comes creeping.
It is like I lie there waiting for it to hit while hoping that it will stay away.
I feel it physically and it is so scary. I manage to get up and get my daugther to scool and myself to work but I feel like walking in a trance or some parrallel worrld.
The anxiety is so big and I feel like crying and creeping in to a hole. I cannot eat, and I become more and more tired; probably from lack of eating an overthinking.
Most of the time I am not even thinking about the OCD thoughts concerning my relationship - sometimes the """"""""what ifs"""""""" does come up, but most of the time I am in this terrible feeling of
dread.
Does anyone know this? The not engaging very much in the specific thoughs? It is like there is no room for them. It is a feeling of numbness as well as terror.
And then the feeling that this will never go away, that I shall live with this anxiety forever.
I find it so hard to cope. I do the things in my daily life, I need to do, but everything seems so completely meaningless and I only do them because I have to.
Yesterday I wrote an email to my psychiatrist - a very, very capable man, one of if not the most weel respected OCD counserlers in Denmark, where I live.
I haven't been at his office for three years, I think, because I have been so good.
I asked for an appointment and he actually offered me one in two weeks. This feels unbearable, but I guess I am lucky..
I also asked if I could up my dose to stop the anxiety and help me being able to focus and work with the CBT.
Of course he would not advise me to do this, and of course I will not do it then.
My questions is: does anyone else get this; that the only thing, you feel is anxiety and worry that this will never go away?
I find it very hard to use the four steps, which I have found useful before, because I do not know what to approach. I know how OCD basically work, but it like, I have no thoughts to addres - do you follow me?
Also, do you know this; when the anxiety for some reason has been away for a while, maybe because I have been engaged whith some work or something, it should of course be aa good thing. But then I get this feeling """"""""oh, there is something I need to worry about"""""""", and then it kicks in again. It is almost like I get a bad conscience because I haven't thought about it for a while.
It feels like this real threat is there, and of course I should be worrying about it!
Well this post became very, very long. I really hope that some of you has managed to read it all through, and will try offer me some piece of advise.
I would really apprieciate any thought on my situation.","['email', 'office', 'hope', 'Thought', 'OCD', 'anxiety', 'anxiety']",['theme'],"['anxiety', 'hope', 'office', 'email', 'Thought', 'theme', 'OCD']",1.0,,1,0,
Hi there! I have had ocd for 10 years or so but just recently found out about ocd. Since it is getting worse everyday now i decided to get help which is not very easy. My problem is that i am very anxious and worried all the time about the people that i love. I live in a different country than my family and i always think something bad could happen to them. I dont like it when my husband goes somewhere without me and i hate that i generally feel out of control amd powerless over situations. When im not there i think i cant protect anyone. I am especially scared of flying or also when someone i love is flying. I think to deal with all this i started with these rituals like counting etc. My biggest issue though ia clothing. I feel like if i choose the wrong piece of clothing that something bad will happen to someone i love or someone will die. I picture myself in those clthes and i just feel terrible. I get so anxious and have to change clothes constantly. I know it sounds ridiculous but it takes up so much time and i just dont know what to do about it ! Everytime i try not to give into these feelings i get dizzy and i get headaches. The method of just ignoring it and seeing that nothing bad would gappen also doesn't qork since i convinced myself that if something bad would happen later that that could still be connected to my actions from before.

"All anxiety symptoms can be explained by the hormone adrenalin in the system, breathing incorrectly and by the body preparing for the fight and flight response. Under these influences, the body becomes primed for action. Our heart will speed up to pump blood to the areas we most need it. Breathing gets faster to supply more oxygen to the muscles that are needed. The muscles tense in preparation for fighting or fleeing from the imagined threat. Digestion slows down so blood may be directed to the muscles and brain.
Although symptoms are highly unpleasant they will not harm us.
OCD sufferers make the error of focusing on these symptoms and attributing them to catastrophe, when in fact the symptoms are benign. To counteract this, 'Response prevention' should be employed. This involves resisting the urge to undo or alleviate the sensations (carrying out compulsions) and waiting for the rising anxiety to subside. Gradual reduction and elimination of compulsions is the goal. Holding out from completing the compulsion for as long as possible and assuming a 'so what' attitude are good ways to start achieving a reduction in obsessive thoughts and physical symptoms. Paradoxically, when the compulsions are lessened, obsessions and sensations will rise for a short while BUT THEN reduce in intensity and frequency over time. When response prevention is practised regularly and consistently, the obsessive thoughts and sensations are then less likely to reoccur! The body learns over time to not be continuously primed for fight or flight and so the fight/flight response is not activated as regularly. The person feels less anxious and displays less of the symptoms.
Anxiety symptoms can manifest in many forms (in list below) but TO ACHIEVE THEIR ALLEVIATION, try to shift your focus off yourself and onto a distracting activity. These links will help:

"Hi All
The last few days have been pretty rubbish for me in the OCD way as many of you know my theme is suicide/depression the fear of getting either and then what happens is when my OCD is bad words like commit suicide can play over and over again in my head and feel like a thousand times, not every time Im anxious but when I am I am and I have felt it big time the last few days.
Anyway Ive been having stomach trouble for a good few weeks now and also pain in the cervix which I think could be due to nabothian follicles that are there but I need to see the doc to get that looked at. I have done a menopause kit and it has a faint line which leads me to believe that I am in the menopause Im 40 have four kids and very very overweight 21 stone to be honest, had sweats on and off for ages, disturbed sleep for the last few weeks too since I have had more of an upset stomach. So couple of days ago I read a post on here about someone taking an overdose as they wanted to die cos their OCD was that bad and immediately I felt that sinking feeling that you get and felt like all the blood rushed from me, the following day I felt down which I have done for a few days cos of my OCD and I was lying in bed thinking I could just take tablets and its over well this freaked me out and I was thinking am I depressed, or suicidal omg panic panic panic. I phoned a friend who is a medium who I saw last week who told me in a past life I most likely took my own life hence why the spirit holds on to the memories etc though other things he said made sense but I saw the therapist two days later and he was like really question your thoughts really say to yourself why am I thinking this Im so attached to life and Mrs O was like how do you know blah blah blah all the usual rubbish, like how do you know Im not gonna kill myself etc etc urgh even writing that is making me anxious.
So long story short went to docs today emergency appt as I was saying about my stomach and quick exam said i have IBS heres some tabs I mentioned OCD which he never heard me say in the first place he said do you have a support worker and I was like no so he said phone the newington centre and speak to someone there so you can talk about your OCD as I only have 5 minutes!!!!! I phoned the duty doctor and he was lovely he chatted to me he has a great understanding of OCD and said was it my first session with Ricky and I said no and he said the problem with OCDers is that they have many negative predictions and tend to focus on the negative alot and I was like is he reading my mind and he said bad news can make them feel worse or reading things that half of you wants to read and the other half doesnt. So he will get someone to call me on Monday to see how I am and I was like should I get the meds changed and he said no as medication isnt the answer like a quick fix, when he said I will get someone to call you on Monday I was like if Im still alive I told him that and he said yes you will be tracy just focus on other things nice things positive things even though you feel negative do other things physical things or plan something nice for the weekend and you know when you are like well my weekends at the mo is doing stuff to the house, housework etc, later I was thinking oh no did he think I was suicidal OMG :crybaby:
Sorry its long anyone have any words of wisdom I am trying to learn to meditate and my partner is telling me to do things slowly and start to relax and just accept the thought and do something else its like part of me wont accept that its OCD

<b>A survey of womenâs experiences of anxiety diagnosis and treatment. </b></p>
<p>Perinatal anxiety is very common, but appears to be under-recognised. There is currently very little information about the identification and treatment of perinatal anxiety (anxiety that occurs during pregnancy or after the baby is born). We are conducting a survey to find out about womenâs experiences of anxiety diagnosis and treatment during pregnancy and the postnatal period in order to identify helpful practice and also areas which might be improved. </p>
<p>Anyone who has experienced significant perinatal anxiety in the last ten years is eligible to take part.<br />It does not matter if your anxiety was about the baby or something else, or if your experiences were positive or not. We are simply interested in understanding the experiences of a large group of women. All information will be kept strictly confidential. </p>
<p><b>What would taking part involve?</b><br />If you decide to take part we will email or post you the survey to complete in your own time and return to us. It should take up to an hour, depending on your answers. </p>

"So if you've read one of my previous threads you will know that I suffer from false memories. I got another one today when I'd just started work, basically I was polishing a desk and had a thought and before you know it my head was flooded with details of the supposed scenario, you know the drill. I realise that it's likely OCD but as usual it feels real etc. I haven't asked for reassurance and am trying my best not to ruminate but my anxiety is through the roof. I spiked majorly when someone I work with said something and I feel a bit awful right now. Obviously hoping the memory isn't real. Am I handling this situation correctly? I really don't want to be stuck in the reassurance cycle.","['Thought', 'OCD', 'anxiety', 'anxiety']",['spike'],"['Thought', 'spike', 'anxiety', 'OCD']",1.0,,1,0,
"Hi all,
I have a couple of queries.
Firstly, I'm due to have a night out in London on the weekend - a late birthday treat - and I'm worried I won't enjoy myself. I've been anxious for quite some time and ruminate a lot and it's not a nice feeling. I'm just worried it'll ruin this evening.
Now, to more pressing matters; I've been obsessing about a fear I have, that I might have some internalised homophobia that comes out in my writing. This is a big concern to me and I'm worried about become a hypocrite. I go through a lot of mental anguish writing one little thing, wondering if it's wrong, right, what other people might think. I try to resist, but then I try to stop writing as well and then I wonder if it's the wrong thing to do, to stop writing and whether it shows some sense of homophobia. I worry that I'm better writing scenes with heterosexual couples, rather than homosexual couples, when I want to approach both equally. This has been a source of anxiety for me for a long time and it's something I'm still dealing with. I don't know if I'm forcing myself to write certain scenes, just to prove something to myself, but the trouble is, I keep getting stuck. I don't need to write certain scenes to prove I'm not homophobic; there are other ways of promoting tolerance and acceptance, after all. But I feel guilty for being to write a heterosexual scene so easily and I can't do the same with a homosexual one. It just makes me feel so guilty and wonder if I'm a hypocrite if I can't always seem to write a homosexual scene. I don't write anything graphic, either way, because that's not my cup of tea.
I'm sorry to bring this strange post to the board; it's just, being accepting and open-minded is important to me and I don't want to be homophobic or a hypocrite. It just makes me so anxious but I push myself too hard and start taking on obsessive and compulsive behaviours, such as internet research and self-comparison. it brings on stress, rather than enjoyment. I know I just have to write and just do it and I won't enjoy it if I'm forcing it. I just hate feeling like a hypocrite. I want to be fair and accepting and tolerant to all sexualities and this desire to be so, has brought my anxiety on before. It sounds odd, but it's something I've seriously discussed with my psychiatrist; it's something that means something to me. I just feel so guilty if I can't write certain scenes, and I don't want to be homophobic on either general or religious grounds and I can waste a lot of time trying to prove to myself I'm not.
Aaargh, sorry. Just helps to get this out sometimes, when I'm not sure what to do.","['fear', 'anxiety', 'anxiety', 'joy', 'guilt', 'writing', 'Compulsive behavior']",['obsessive'],"['anxiety', 'obsessive', 'fear', 'writing', 'joy', 'Compulsive behavior', 'guilt']",,1.0,1,1,

"Hello All,
As I have said before, my OCD is non-violent harm OCD. It tells me that I have contaminate things with bodily fluids. Well, this afternoon, my wife asked me, as she was very busy at the time to get her a packet of cheese biscuits from the kitchen.
Alarm bells began to sound and my inner voice said 'oh my goodness you can't do that.' But I said 'ok' Not only did I get her a packet I got a different flavour for myself. 
My goodness, how I am paying for it now. I have not asked for reassurance that all is ok and my anxiety due to the liar OCD is going through the roof.
I am told that this is the way to defeat OCD and the anxiety will fade, well I hope so!
This isn't just a spike this is the real McCoy. I just hope it's worth it.

"As I have been advised to do on here I have been noting down exposure activties and measuring the level of anxiety that they cause me. I find this to be beneficial and I can see a constant downward trend which is great. As part of this exercise I have done a list analsying the anxiety caused in situations on a scale of 1-10. Anxiety can be hard to measure so I have used the following scale when trying to measure it. The things I think about when trying to categorise anxiety is how long it stays around after the event; how many spikes I had during the event; how intense was the anxiety throughout; and was the anxiety constant, intermittent or mainly in spikes. Finally I ask did I actually enjoy the activity. If it is 3 or lower on the scale I can enjoy it. Anyway thought I would share. How does this apply to you?
Scale Post Exposure Anxiety No of Spikes Intensity Presence Enjoyed Activty?
1 < 10 mins 1 - 3 Very low Intermittent Yes
2 30 mins 1 - 3 Low Intermittent Yes
3 1 hour 1 - 3 Low Constant with spikes Yes
4 3 hours 3 - 6 Moderate Intermittent Partially
5 1/2 day 3 - 6 Moderate Constant Not really

"Hi, sorry to jump on here, but I hope someone can help me. I was on here about 2 months ago because I had a lot of rituals that I was doing at night time and I was getting really tired, to the point of stumbling as it was late at night. The rituals ranged from drinking water in certain ways, to tapping door handles, checking items in my personal bag whilst counting from 1 to 20 in certain ways and chanting sounds, like when I got scared when I saw the image of my dad having a heart attack, plus a few other rituals. So I was getting really tired.
To cut a long story short (and I moved into my new flat this April which also stressed me out), I have a back condition (2 rods in my spine) which affects my back and hips. I recently had a bath lift put in my bath so I could get in and out of the bath while easing pressure on my back. The first time I used the lift a few weeks ago (I just wash quickly now) one evening, I felt sleepy while in the bath. I washed etc then got out and did my usual routine. But that night (my rituals are nomally between 1am and 4am) I fell asleep till 3am because of the bath and i panicked on waking up. The timing of rituals changed and went to bed at 4.30am.
But as time has gone, I feel I'm getting more sleep probably because my body needs it, but I'm waking up and start to panic and do some rituals. But last night, I did one ritual a bit after midnight, and slept till 6.45am this morning and I panicked as I missed out about 6 or 7 rituals I normally do and took my night time medication really late. I don't know if this is right or wrong?
I've got my CBT appointment through in about 3 weeks time, but it's how I'll get through from now until then. It just feels strange to go through it, can anyone give me some advice please? I can get limited internet access on my mobile, i'm in the housing office at the moment.
thanks, and sorry for going on

"Hi Everyone,
I'm really struggling just now. I spent all evening tidying my room for a valuation on our house this week. I find tidying my room incredibly anxiety provoking because there are bacterial contaminants (dirty objects that I haven't touched or cleaned for ages, pots of face/hand cream that have been left around and other disgusting things) that I fear might make me ill AND more significantly there are things that might make my dog ill/die such as Voltarol (which can cause fatal kidney failure in dogs in tiny tiny doses), an Ibuprofen lying around, a broken paracetamol and a sterilising tablet (loose, just lying there) [our dog isn't allowed upstairs but I'm worried about walking those things through the house]. I showered after cleaning my room because I felt so anxious and because my back was really painful from all the bending.
Anyway I then came down from tidying my room, expecting to watch some TV with my family but my Dad was out at the shop and my Mum was out on a walk around the block, something which we usually do together. I then completely lost it over my Mum going for the walk without me. I still feel distressed and I know that this response is excessive, unreasonable and must sound really strange to other people. I am in my twenties, so not even a young teen/child! 
I think that it is just because I was finding tidying my room sooo anxiety provoking and plain scary (everything was threatening, with everything that I cleaned I felt like something terrible was going to happen). Also my Mum had advised me not to go for my usual run because of the stormy weather so I had tidied my room instead and I'm also very unhappy with everything in my life at the moment. I sometimes worry that I might be a sociopath because I have bouts of rage and for periods of time I don't care how I am affecting other people. I'm not sure whether I have a personality disorder OR this is just a consequence of OCD- can anyone relate? or is it only children with OCD that have rage attacks?

A couple little suggestions:
1) If you are very private with your picking, be with other people when you get the urge. For example, last night some of my family was visiting me. I was washing my hands in the restroom when I got the urge to pick while looking in the mirror. Before I could reach for my face, I jumped out of the bathroom where the others could see me. There's no way I would pick my face in the living room with other people there!
2) If you have to look in the mirror (e.g. for makeup application), stand far away enough that you can see your face, but not all the little details. (It will probably make your skin look clearer from that perspective!) You won't be able to see any imperfections, so you won't have the desire to """"""""correct"""""""" them.
3) Redirect your perfectionism toward cleaning the house, a work assignment, homework, paperwork, exercise.","['washing hands', 'bathroom', 'living room', 'urge']",[],"['living room', 'bathroom', 'urge', 'washing hands']",,1.0,0,1,
"I frequently find myself taking an excessive amount of time to edit my own writing (part of my job). I don't necessarily think this is my OCD acting up because there is not necessarily an specific anxiety involved. It's not like I'm checking specific things over and over again because I'm worried there being some kind of mistake. I just feel really focused in on the details and getting them right. I can spend quite a bit of time on things that others seem to breeze through more quickly.
I did notice, however, that last time my OCD was bad that I also started doing this with trivial non-work related writing. Again, it didn't make me feel anxious really, but I was amazed how much time flew by with me entirely focused on something that should have taken 5 minutes.
I know that the """"""""just right"""""""" feeling is part of OCD for some, though. This getting """"""""stuck"""""""" while writing/ editing, is not necessarily distressing for me, but it is time consuming, I suppose.

"Hi,
In the last month I have tried to expose myself to the disturbing images for 10 - 15 min daily and prevent myself from ruminating and endless revisiting issues, well not every day. One day I forced myself to do this, other day not.
Why? Because it is incredibly difficult. The initial thought appears within sec and my brain starts automatic rumination so every time I pay attention to flow of my thoughts I catch myself ruminating again!
I say to myself: I will NOT do this again, but this ruminating semmes to be something like an automatic way of my brain to react.
I sometimes feel that I am hopeless. I try so hard to ruminate and the result is so small so far. Well have I done any progress at all?
How should I know and who tells me that? Does this method works for me at all?
You know, if there were not for this forum, this would be quite bad for me. I receive no or little support from my family and my friends.
They like me, but the mental disease is topic to avoid, so they never ask my about my condition. They cannot still accept there is something like this in the family. If I told my roomate about my disease, I would be on the street next morning - nobody wants to share room with mental patient.
So I came here again and seek some encouragement. Sorry

"This is a problem a number of us have; distressing thoughts or images constantly whirr in the mental chatter in our mind, whatever else we are doing.
I would like very much to be able to provide more help to help my fellow forum members struggling currently with this problem.
Below is a post I first made under the heading """"""""Thought Loops In OCD - Causes & Stopping Them"""""""".
Any good ideas now everyone?
Posted 22 August 2013 - 08:22 PM
A thought loop takes the form of distressing words or images that whirr round and round in your head without an exit point or any form of resolution.

Thought loops are the heart of my own problem with OCD and, because they are similar to worry, cause anxiety and acute physical and mental distress.

They commonly are found together with ruminating about the past, obsessing, or exaggerating or awfulising and overgeneralising, or triggering compulsive behaviour.

I have been researching this issue , and I believe that the root of the loop, which breaks out when I experience an episode of OCD, may be attributable to breakdown in the interraction of thought processes between the orbital-frontal cortex, the caudate nucleus and the thalamus in the brain. The connections break down, i'ts like the wires overheating, and the thoughts don't pass through and dissipate, they stick in the mind and won't leave.

This seems logical to me, so assuming this as a realistic cause, how can the thought loop be switched off?

1). Disruption - deliberately bringing into cognitive thinking some absorbing and powerful alternative activity that demands extreme concentration.(such as writing a post in this forum).

2).One idea is that there are two halves of the brain involved in words and pictures . If the looping involves pictures, get concentrating hard on some written material. If the looping involves words, get seriously involved in considering pictures. There is some thinking that this will momentarily interrupt the thought processing, healing the connection within the brain and breaking the loop.

3). Medication used in OCD can in some cases help restore the connections and ease the loops/break the loop cycle or ease their effect.

4).Aanother idea is that you imagine the thoughts leaving your head, going over the top of it, down your neck and trickling down you body and away.
5). Or breathing them out into a balloon that then floats up into the sky and away.
6). Another therapy for disrupting distressing thoughts is REM - not the pop group, but nevertheless rapid eye movement. The idea is that whilst intensely thinking the thoughts you rapidly move your eyes from side to side for a little while. This again is said to momentarily freeze the neural pathways and may shock the brain into repairing the break and dismissing the thoughts or their intensity
.ONLY DO THESE IN A VERY SAFE ENVIRONMENT EG AT THOME IN A CHAIR, NOT WHILST DRIVING OR OPERATING MACHINERY.


Since these repetitive thought loops are a key part of OCD thoughts, what other ideas have people found that can break the thought loops?
A ll suggestions welcome boys and girls, anything spring to mind?
Kind regards

"well heres my little sum up of my ****!
i have had ocd as long as i could rememebr life.
ive been pulling my hair out since i was a teen.
ive had issues about food sice i was a teen - anorexic tendencies and all that ****.
then i started getting panic attacks.
then i started panicking about my health really, really badly (ie i get a headache and before i get the time to think logically about why ive a headache i think its something really bad, like a brain tumour so i have a panic attack) so ive been labeled with having a health anxiety.
then it all just spiralled and just haivng ocd is bad enough without all the other stuff so im starting therapy which is great.
and for the icing on the dam awful cake i get nightmares everynight and thats my ocd never giving me a break ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
trouble is im fighting like all the time that i am actually going mad.
even though my therapist said its normal for someone with ocd to think that and i know this i still cant help feeling they all think i am truly mad and there trying to protect me and want to lock me up.
see logically i know shes doing her job and helping me and logically and i read this as well as was told this, thats what people with ocd do think but the ocd bit keeps saying - yeh well shes making out shes helping you but really shes going to section you cause your mad
you know peoples, this drives me nuts thinking about everything, bloody rumination and all that.
im paranoid in publice places that i will get mugged, paranoid and scared when i see a plane fly over that its going to crash, scared when i see a lorry coming the other way that its going to swerve in to my car, scared when im in a shopping centre that theres going to be a terrorist attack - these are a few of the many, many everyday things that freak me out, im even scared beacuse of all this im going to be too scared to leave my house one day and that freaks me right out that maybe im turning in to an agrophobic.
ocd is the absolute pits but im going to fight it.
i guess we ocd and related stuff sufferers just have such internal battles, real and ocd fulled thoughts
someone tell me im not going mad please! - although i probably wont believe you (lol ive gotta laugh or i will cry and scream then i really will get locked up!)
ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh and WHY all this **** in my head? i have a lovely life a happy family and all that i just dont know why this has got so bad, snowballed.......

"OK, so this is silly. Ever since I was young, I have had these... I suppose they where intrusive phrases, but I turned them into rituals that my mind will repeat when I am stressed or something. They range from mild, confusing to rather disgusting and very hard to explain away. Most of the time I do not notice them unless I am a bit peeved or stressed, and sometimes when I am really stressed, I say them to myself. Sometimes under my breath, and sometimes I just like… hold my breath, click my tongue, grunt or kind mime them? I dunno. Now recently I have started to socialise a little more (Via D&D!) and become more confidant at speak with people, and so my OCD decides to go ‘Hay… what if you said out loud all these horrible/weird things you repeat!’ and so, that gets me stressed, which sometimes makes me repeat the things, which makes me fear that I am gonna say something bad  in my head blah blah…

Really, I know what this is. Its just my OCD trying to get attention. I only really ever think this when I have just gotten over a spike elsewhere. Also I have tried making more of an effort to… well, not stop these rituals, more not give them notice but just either let them pass or trip them up (Example. ‘I wont trip someone over’ turns to ‘Well maybe I will, you never know.’) Plus, as far as I am aware I have never had someone here mean say anything out loud. When I start talking to people and getting into something I stop thinking about the fear. Besides, if I did say something horrible/disgusting/damning out loud then, well, I deal with that when/if it happens. I think my OCD wants me to confess these things to my mum, it always tries to guilt me into it. Its an aspect of my OCD I have not really told her much about, and I dunno how she would react. She has been wonderful with my mind stuff, but still jumps to conclusions and expresses disappointment when I say I have had a spike etc. Plus she is very ill, and I just do not want to add to any of her mental stress.

Anyway… after writing this I did not know if I should post this. It really is just a way of seeking reasurace, isnt it? Damn, perhaps I should have just let it be when I started feeling a bit better about it... but I am curious if anyone else goes though similar things. Eh well.

"Lately I have had a bit of a problem with thinking that I smell. :blushing:
For example at work yesterday I just kept thinking I smelled terrible from bad breath or some other odor from my body. I shower and use deoderant and brush my teeth and all the other things a normal person does. But yesterday I was just so convinced I had some foul smell coming from me.I kept chewing spicy cinnamon gum and I even put this mint oil I keep for headaches on my hands and a bit on my clothes to mask the smell. It has happened before and just as I am writing this I am thinking of things that I do that may be related to this.
Like if I have been to the loo (and I don't mean just for a wee) I feel as though the whole world will know so I usually will not go unless I am going to be able to shower or clean up proper after.
I love tuna but I usually-90% of the time will only have it at home and usually only make/eat it on my days off from work and wait to take my shower and brush my teeth until after so as to remove any lingering smell.
I do not shower or wash my hands excessively but I do both regularly so I am a thinking this may be my OCD?
Anyone else know of this or have something like it?

"Hi,
This is the first time ive posted on a website. Ive been suffering from OCD for the past few years, at first it was worrying about my work, did i send something which wouldn’t stand up in court etc. But its moved more into really depressing and disgusting thoughts i.e. would my nephew think i was abusing him because i helped him get changed, did i behave inappropriately with people.
Ive tried a few times to seek help but have gotten no where; my doctor has suggested this time trying it without medication but im getting worse, everyday is a struggle i cry every day; i cant focus in work and my quality of life is diminishing to the point where i dont want to leave the house and i trust no one, not even my sister.
Ive been on a waiting list for months trying to get started on CBT, no one is willing to give me a timeframe for how long i'll have to wait.
I try to tell myself these are just thought and there is no substance to them but its hard especially as i feel like im on the verge of a break down and don’t feel able to control myself at all times.
I now know excessive alcohol doesn’t help, whilst being in this state i have behaved irresponsibly (trying to kiss people and being suggestive) towards friends who i don’t even fancy, i have a boyfriend and this is not my normal behaviour. This has compounded every bad thought i have about the bad person i am and can no longer dismiss thoughts as just thoughts!!
It has led me to be questioning things like, what if ive tried it on with my own dad, when ive been in a drunken state.
Every thought i have is always linked to how my boyfriend will be disgusted by me and leave me, so i try and tell him every thought that bothers me, but it is becoming frustrating because he puts everything down to being in my (which is quite likely based upon my drunken behaviour) head and that im not that sort of person. He doesnt seem to understand i dont feel in control so can not guarantee my behaviour is accpetable at all times.
The worst part of my condition is my lack of memory, if i have an intursive thought my memory wont let me find anything to quash it, just hazy half memories and guilty feelings which escalate it.
I dont know where else to turn, or what else to do........","['site', 'OCD', 'Medication', 'quality', 'guilt', 'disgust', 'Thought']","[‘disgusting thoughts’,’excessive']","['quality', 'site', 'disgust', 'Thought', 'excessive', 'Medication', 'OCD', 'guilt']",1.0,1.0,1,1,

This is worse than the **** before this. It makes the thought seem more real. Im worried that im not anxious about them any more. This is a vicsous cycle. I keep mentally checkin my reactions to my thoughts but nothing. No emotion to anything. Its like my emotions are numb so I dont know how I feel about anything. And my need for certainty is huge. I realise this is not good but I cant help it. How can I just stop being worried that im not worried. I know my body can only produce so much anxiety until it levels out. But I cant stop the thoughts. Stupid questions like what if ive turned. Why do they no longer bother me? Whats wrong now? This Is worse than the ocd stuff before the back door spike. I know this is common in recovery but any advice please? The other day I wasnt worried that I wasnt worried about worrying. So now im worried that im not worried about worrying. Confusing right?

I have a question mainily for those of you that have suffered longer term with OCD, & I would be grateful if anyone can advise.
Basically, a CBT therapists has suggested on 2 occasions now that it might be time to think about managing OCD, as opposed to treating it, having had it for such a long time. Have any of you been advised similar, & know what is meant by it?
I should have asked more about this, but I kind of dismissed the 'managing' suggestion because I can`t visualise that this is something possible, as I have about 4 OCD themes going on which work both singularly & in conjunction with eachother, & is relentless.

"In a lot of ways, I think I've been doing pretty well lately, but then I ended up having a big sobbing session on Saturday evening and the more I've thought about it over the past couple of days, the more I've begun to wonder if it could have been avoided, and just wanted to share my thoughts on it.
We'd had a lovely day and I was really looking forward to the evening too. We weren't going out, but to me it seemed the perfect evening. I'd talked my boyfriend into watching a good old soppy girly film that I'd bought (just the sort I love!) and we'd bought chocolates (another thing I REALLY love!!) to curl up on the sofa with it. We were going to watch it in the next ten minutes or so, but I thought I'd just try to get a little job out of the way first: It might not sound like a big task, but one of the little targets I've been setting myself lately is to be able to put my clean clothes that have been washed away in my drawers without washing my hands first.I've done it a few times recently without many problems, but for some reason, this evening after a few items of clothing I ended up throwing one of them back into the wash basket cos I though I saw """"""""bad stuff"""""""" on it(something I used to do regularly, but have hardly done at all recently)
My immediate thought was, OK just walk away, have a sit down and go back to it later, which would have been fine if I'd kept that calm thinking up. I started well by going into the lounge and making a bit of a joke about it to my boyfriend, but then suddenly it was like I'd got this urge to make more of the situation than there actually should have been and it all went downhill from there. I blurted out """"""""Right well, that's it - We can't watch the film now can we cos I don't deserve it!"""""""" My boyfriend tried alsorts of tactics, telling me of course we should watch it and that I probably actually needed it MORE now to relax and calm down, but once I'd said I didn't deserve it, that was it, my mind was made up!
Its bizarre really. I desperately wanted to watch the film and have the evening I was looking forward to, but it was like I just couldn't allow myself to have it somehow. I kept wittering on about how I was supposed to have made progress, but if I hadn't then I didn't deserve any treats
I don't know if anyone else has got any thoughts on this. Is this sort of behaviour just me being a bit wierd? or is this typical of the ocd too?

"The article below talks about the """"""""just right"""""""" feeling, when i read the title i thought it was for me but it sounds a little different but i agree..
The """"""""just right"""""""" feeling- This is where sufferers experience anxiety and discomfort if a particular action, motion, or thought doesn't """"""""feel"""""""" right in a certain way. No one but the sufferer can actually say what this feeling is, and they even usually find it hard to describe, but claim to know it when they experience it. If it just doesn't feel right as they do something, it may have to be repeated over and over again from the beginning until it does. If this feeling must be there in order to begin an activity, the sufferer may have to wait long periods of time before even starting. Clearly either of these can take up a lot of time, making the sufferer very inefficient, and causing everyday activities to drag on for long periods. This is something also commonly seen in those who suffer from Tourette's Syndrome.

Even though my rituals sound like they are OCD (unwanted thoughts and rituals), they sound so different from other's.

"Hello
I found this on the internet.
It says
if a child suffers from obsessive-compulsive disorder, instinctively easing their anxiety could in fact be counterproductive according to new research from the University of Florida.
The researchers found, based on analysis of 49 children with OCD, that assisting children to complete their OCD rituals may ease the anxiety in the short term, but can actually strengthen the obsessive behavior in the longer term.
But it says new research so how long have they said that exposure 'accepting anxiety ect would help?

"Hey,
Saw As Good as it Gets recently and wondered what everyone else thought of the way Jack Nicholson played the part of an OCD sufferer. Personally, I indentified with quite a lot of his rituals, such as locking the door 5 times, avoiding contact with others, and I too would have probably freaked out at the thought of wearing someone else's jacket! (Crab restaurant scene). Something that did confuse me a bit was his insistence on following routine - such as eating in the same restaurant every day, at the same table, and being served by the same waitress. If it was because he felt those were the only places that were contamination free I could understand, but I got the feeling it was more just the fact of HAVING to follow a certain routine that he was obsessed with.
Can anyone shed some light on this?
Furthermore, I read a review on this film where someone referred to the 'mentally handicapped' main character. Does OCD count as a mental handicap? If so, news to me!
Thanks

"I have OCD which mainly revolves around a. religious worries and b. germs. It really gets on my nerves and sometimes I feel like I am going mad. However, when I come on this board and see the trouble that some people have - can't leave the house, suicidal thoughts. harming thoughts - I feel kind of ashamed and self-pitying. Whilst my OCD is really annoying it doesn't prevent me functioning and though I do get depressed sometimes it's not that bad. When I was younger, around 18, it was worse and my problems were visible to others and I had trouble leaving the house because I had so many rituals to perform. It just seemed to get better. Anyway, I am wondering whether this means my OCD is actually under control and that is not likely to get any better than it is at the moment?

"Hi,
Struggling with something a little different today. I remember some things that I have done that I feel bad about. These involve past relationships, daft sexual things I've done, silly pervy stuff I've done in the fairly recent past. Some stuff I remember thinking about and can't remember if I did it or not. This is not based around my usual issues of POCD, this is stuff with adult females that I've known or worked with. I've developed feelings for people that I've worked with in the past, even married women, and I feel bad for this. I was besotted with someone a few years ago, and I remember smelling a coat that she'd left at work once- I'd also had thoughts about other stuff, can't remember if I acted on them and feel bad that I might have (I was turned on by the thoughts).
I feel bad for all this, I feel like I need to beat myself up about it all, had a major spike about this today.
I don't' know why I'm writing this, I just need to get it out of my head. The daft pervy stuff (had a thought about smelling a girls chair (sorry, this is pretty grim), I remember feeling turned on by this, but can't remember if I did it- it's horrible and I feel terrible about it), is making me feel bad, and this reinforces my POCD stuff (well if I'm capable of doing something like that, maybe I'm capable of doing other stuff). I've also googled this stuff- worst thing I could've done, I should no better, now I feel worse.
This is the worst I've felt in a wee while. I'm sorry if anything I've written upsets anyone. I do try so hard to be a nice person. Just can't cope with this today.

"Hi guys just thought id post about how my assesment went today.
I was mega nervous before i went, felt like i was going to my own exicution lol. It went really well though, i told her about alot of the things i was scared to mention as i was convinced she'd say there was something else going on, she said everything i said falls under the anxiety banner though, so i was happy about that. I didnt say some things but i will open up a bit more when i go again next. I told her that id been to therapy before but didnt find it helpful as it was just a talking therapy with no strategies to deal with the actual problem.
After id told her what has been ging on lately she told me that she'd refer me for a course of cbt! I was really happy when she said that was the recommended treatment for these types of problems and this was what we were going to be getting stuck into. I really wanna get stuck in now, she said the waiting times shouldnt be too bad as its fairly quiet there at the minute. I find myself second guessing now though, i feel like i need to tell her every bizzare thought ive ever had just in caser theres something that should cause concern. I'm playing into ocds hands with this, i think that i've gotten to the bottom of one thought, then im reminded of another thought and i try to do the same with that. It feels that ive got a never ending list of thoughts/experiences that i need 100% assurance arent anything over than ocd, classic ocd i know. She mentioned something about whether i have any delusional thoughts during the assesment, and now im obsessing over when a thought is a delusional thought or not. I mean ive had some very very strange thoughts. One of the lateset ones is i have people living in my head. How crazy is that!! Im pretty sure its because ive obssesed over having schizophrenia and its just something the ocd has thrown out at me to dwell on.
Its like i can see how stupid it sounds but i cant FEEL that its stupid, when the anxieties off on one its all i can think of and how that could be a delusional thought. I think i need to stop seeing each and every different thought as its own sepereate issue/theme because ive had them all, violent, peadophile, gay fears, aids/hiv, cancer, magical thinking, relationship.

"Hi everyone, I need to let off some steam and find out how other people are coping.
I am exhausted - I hosted Christmas and New Year and although went well (better than last year - my lowest time) it feels like the OCD has gone a step back and my energy levels are very low therefore fighting it is even harder.
I do not want to assess risk anymore - whether it be pure o or contamination - I'm sick of it its constant. It is soo tiring and because it focuses on my little girl (can't even write this without crying) or actually any child or baby I feel that I have to ensure that I minimise the risk or harm.
I have had therapy from the OCD Centre, I read all the time, I constantly conduct exposure exercises and I am always stopping myself from conducting rituals, I am always using the various techniques and although its got better it is still so difficult to just live and enjoy life without the ****. I don't want to be unappreciative for what I have and the support I have but non OCD sufferers do not have a clue how difficult it is to live everyday not giving in to thoughts that could potentially harm a child. Im putting in the hard work but still it is intrusive. I want to have my friends over with a baby and not worry 'did I spill the bleach, did the air freshener spill etc' I can decide not to put the bleach down the toilet the day they come but that gives in to the OCD I am a grown woman that worries about if I don't do something properly they could be in danger.
I am very aware my energy levels are low at the mo which is making everything appear more difficult but even if that wasn't the case its a constant fight. I am now trying to challenge my beliefs which are fuelling the OCD and that is challenging as I do believe people should ( I know punitive) take great care with children and not put them at risk - they are so precious.
So, thank you for reading not sure how much of it makes sense!
Take care one and all

"Hi,
Been going through hell these past few weeks. It all started with such a little ritual. I would have normally brushed it away but it involved the car (and therefore driving which is a source of anxiety) so I engaged with it. Pretty soon it became important and when that happens I doubt that it is done right and doubt my senses. The target number racks up as I add more to compensate for the ones I am not sure about (now at 91).
Soon a sub-ritual is introduced that must be done before I can complete the major one. I say this is just a bonus, a nicety but """"""""made a deal"""""""" with the OCD that main rituals can be slack if this sub-ritual is done right. But I can never tell it is done right. I write the steps down to remember but I doubt my notes. I try to write down the """"""""rules"""""""" like a contract but OCD seems to find loop holes in it. The target number racks up to compensate for the ones I am not sure about and the target number has to not be an """"""""unlucky"""""""" number (target now at 23).
I wanted the sub-ritual to be done before my Birthday today. I just wanted it done so I can go out on a day trip with my nan without having to be nagged by all this ****. To have a sense of completion. She is getting on. There might not be that many day trips left. I just wanted to enjoy her company without being distracted by OCD and being distant.
I wanted these rituals done so I can go back to some sort of normal life. My motivation was that I don't want to be reminded that I failed doing this ritual. I don't want important days in my life ruined by being preoccupied with this ritual, rumminating on how I should have persisted with it.
The numbers were racking up almost by the minute as I keep finding fault with the rituals and trying to make the rules more water tight. It was becoming aparent that it was never going to be complete before today.
I have been depressed all month but something sinister started to happen. I started to feel scared. Really scared. The sort of fear I haven't had in decades. The sort of fear you get before you are about to have a fight or just discovered that your bike has been stolen. I was almost going to be sick.
I kept saying these past weeks to the OCD / me / whatever that you push me too far then it is over. I never had a panic attack before but it seems like I was starting to have one so I gave up, stormed out the flat and went to watch Star Trek at the cinema.
I feel awful though. My head is tingling. I feel angry, depressed, sad, numb almost all the time. I feel that my family, pets and friends are in danger. Most of all I feel I will never feel normal again. That I will never forget these rituals and that I failed doing them. There will never be a sense of completion and I will be nagged about it for years to come.
Someone tell me it will end. That I will be the same again. That I will not be haunted by this for the rest of my life.","['anxiety', 'anxiety', 'joy', 'anger', 'fear', 'OCD', 'Rituals']",[],"['anxiety', 'anger', 'fear', 'joy', 'Rituals', 'OCD']",,1.0,0,1,

"This is a subject cropping up regularly currently on these support forums.
I thought I would roll out a topic where we can all discuss this.
For me, direct attempts to """"""""control"""""""" OCD thinking are likely doomed to failure.
Any engagement with intrusions - even unwillingly - strengthens them; and do watch for any """"""""hidden"""""""" compulsive behaviours as these will also strengthen intrusions.
When we carry out ERP, we need to sit with intrusions, feeling the power of the suggested meanings, but accepting they are falsehoods, exaggeration of minimum threat or just repulsive urges. Anxiety will be high but, gradually - when we have stopped the exposure after at least a few minutes, then revisited it at different times, we should find the anxiety falling off and the intrusions losing power. For some this will happen quicker than for others.
Outside of the ERP, we can deploy refocus away, then getting busy on beneficial distraction or, preferably, what we particularly WANT to do anyway.
Finally when intrusions seem overpowering and we are struggling to refocus away, we can try a thought defusion process. Check the search field for previous threads/topics about this, but here are some ideas I have found helpful.
Breathing out unpleasant thoughts.
We can imagine breathing in white light, and then breathing out unpleasant thoughts in the form of, say, grey cloud.
We can imagine the intrusions spoken in our mental chatter in a silly voice.
We can visualise the thoughts as choppy waves on the ocean surface. But deep below the waves, we can see that the water is in fact calm.
We can view the intrusions as a distressing hill we have to cycle up - but we are given a new cycle with twice as many gears,so we can now ascend the hill much more comfortably.
We can take the """"""""helicopter"""""""" view. Detach yourself and imagine looking down on yourself from above - seeing your thoughts as another (non-sufferer) would see them.
You are the driver on a bus - the unwanted intrusions are rowdy passengers. Make a public address announcement - if they don't calm down, the bus will be going nowhere until they do.
What other useful thought power defusions do you know, or can you think up?

"Hi everyone.I joined here.I'm hoping that I'm not alone with the OCD version thats been affecting me.
Most of my problems are specifically stopping me doing things,yet,I have very few rituals.
This all started in 2006.I remember the exact moment it started.What a rotten day.It was bade enough that I have food intolerances and Chronic Fatigue Syndrome but to have this nonsense was a nightmare.
I think of it as a computer virus equivalent for us humans.It stopps me doing things I need to do and things I want to do.It does so at random.Then there are various things it makes me do.I got it easy in that department.
Here's some of the things it stops me doing:
1)unable to eat when I'm on my own.
2)unable to remove rubbish/recyclables fro my home.
3)unable to change my clothes(wearing the same gear last 4 years)
4)unable to move various items around my home.Everything stayed where its been since day 1.
(although I've moved to another property about 5 years ago.
5)it stops me saying certain things.
What is weird is there are somethings I can get done if someone else does it for me.
Then there are problems that I just dont go near.
Then there are the few rituals.Dong things at set times in a set way.Problem is,if I get into a habit of doing something if I do it the same way 3 days straight then it becomes a new ritual.
Some good news.I started enjoying eating apples in my daily food intake.I noticed that I started feeling better regularly,and,I could do a few things I hadnt been able to do.This as an ongoing thing.I havent given up apples for obvious reasons.
I tried to find an alternative therapy that might be of help.I tried something called Rebirthing.Thought it had something to with being reborn,not so.Its more about breathing.I tied this and it helps.A local Kinesiologist helped out there.Really makes that flight/fight response ease off and easier to live with.

"Hello. My last post here was about five months ago and I got a very helpful response. I wrote about being stressed about moving and worried my daughter would get picked on in her new school. I also wrote about how I was feeling my job was toxic: I'm a collection lawyer and have to chase people who have judgments against them but who hide assets to avoid paying, and have to deal with a lot of difficult characters.

The move turned out to be decent. My daughter for the most part likes the new school, and is now on summer vacation. Although she did have a few incidences of being teased (e.g. after she got braces), for the most part it went well. My problem now is that I decided, in order to pursue my passion and lessen stress, to get back into chess.  I used to teach it for a living. For many people it's not just a game, but also an art form, and I could spend hours a day reading, playing, talking to other people about it, etc. I had goals in chess, and there are an endless amount of books, youtube videos, and articles about it to keep anyone busy who is devoted to getting better. It allows me to be creative which my work doesn't allow a lot of opportunities for. As you probably know, though, OCD attacks whatever we find important or enjoyable. Now when I play I keep ruminating on whether or not I am finding the right work/family balance. I keep thinking that my daughter is 12 and she is at an age where she needs me most. While I'm in the middle of a game I debate with myself over how much time is appropriate for me to spend on chess during the summer and still have enough time for work and family. First I tell myself one hour per day, then I tell myself that an hour is too short. Why not 2-4 hours per day since my daughter is a lot of the time doing activities with friends anyway, and if I put that amount of time into it I could have very good results? These are the thoughts I'm having, and I'm unsatisfied with whatever resolution I come up with. I feel like either I'm not devoting enough time to chess, or that I am devoting too much time to it. Last week I played three games in a tournament where I won the first two, but then in the third game these thoughts bombarded me and I lost concentration and drew in a won position. 

It's really gotten to the point where I'm thinking why do I need to even play at all. Would it be ok for me to stop? I know that generally avoidance isn't good, but if I can do other things that I enjoy like reading, doing physical activities like swimming with my daughter, etc, would it be ok for me to stop? I don't want to pursue my passion if it's causing more obsessing than enjoyment. There are times when I really enjoy it but then OCD comes on and makes it nothing but one big rumination. There are other things I enjoy learning about as well, but which don't have the same social and competitive elements that chess has. I don't' really like the idea of competition, but I guess it's something that I and many people are naturally drawn to. 
A similar problem involving avoidance that I'm having is that over the winter I had an idea for an app that I thought would be cool: a social media app which allows you to select from your contacts (i.e. phone contacts, facebook, instagram, etc.) a group of people who you would enjoy having a surprise meeting with. If they are also using the app and choose you, it brings you to an anonymous chat screen where you can chat with that person for the purpose of setting up a time to meet, but you wont know who they are until they show up at the meeting place (you'll only know that they are among you contacts and that you both wanted to meet each other). I found a programmer on linkedin to help me with this. I went a few times to an ios development meetup group where people share ideas and help each other implement them.I kept having ocd at these meetings, though, about whether or not I should give away the idea, or just speak very generally about what I'm working on and get tips about the aspects of it that I'm having trouble with. I decided to tell some people the idea, but prior to coming to meetings I would keep ruminating over it, and it made the experience less enjoyable.
I'm also thinking that while the app itself might be fun to use, people could use it for things like cheating on their spouses and partners. It could facilitate this because in a regular situation, where people are just using something like facebook, there would be a social barrier to asking certain friends to meet (i.e. those who are in committed relationships with other people). For example, on facebook a user would likely restrain himself from reaching out to certain people (e.g. a boss, or the ex girl friend of his friend) because if the recipient of the invitation wasn't interested, it would be awkward the next time they met. With this app, though, it stays anonymous until both people select each other to be in each other's surprise meet pool, and no one will know who the other is until they actually meet at the agreed time and place. 

The app doesn't have to be used, though, in any objectionable way. My main point is that it's an interesting project for me, and it's about 40% complete, but I don't know if I should finish it due to ethical concerns, and it's not clear how much use it would find in the general public in any event. 

Really I just want to have a relaxing time this summer and don't need much. if I have to quit both of the above I will. I've believed for a while that it's not what you do in life that's important, it's what you don't do that matters more. In other words, as long as someone is not violating their principles, they can at least be content. 
I would appreciate any advice.","['talking', 'social media', 'object', 'surprise', 'interest', 'OCD', 'Thought', 'joy']",['rumination'],"['rumination', 'talking', 'surprise', 'social media', 'interest', 'object', 'Thought', 'joy', 'OCD']",1.0,,1,0,
"Hello all,
God I don't know what I would do without this website. Even as i write I can feel the relief flooding in.
As some of you may know, my OCD centres on my marriage.
Nothing is more important to me than my wife.
However, for the first time since this my OCD took this particular """"""""ROCD""""""""-form (in 2009) I am having, because of work, to be away from my wife. I was scared us being apart would kick off my OCD and, sure enough, it has.
I'm flailing around here to pinpoint the exact cause of the anxiety so I'll just let it all hang out.
I guess it's a number of things.
First and foremost, because being a good husband is my top priority I find that when I am at home I can demonstrate this to my wife with my actions. I can tell her how much I love her on an ongoing basis, make her lunch...oh I don't know. I can just let her know she's my top priority.
I guess these are safety behaviours which I practise to an even greater degree when my OCD sets in, but I think it would be true to say that, even when I am not in OCD hell, I want to behave this way anyway. It's not that my wife even asks me to behave this way. It's just that I want to be a good husband to her and make her happy.
However, when I am away with work (I am currently at the Edinburgh Festival so, with the exception of a few days next week, I'll be away from home for a month), I find I must go in to a different mode. I live in digs and, apart of course from the fact that I do not ever go out with other women, I am sort of living a bachelor existence.
I go in to a different mode, anyway, and because my number one self-definition is as a good husband, there is a real conflict there and it really disturbs me.
Also, and I think this really gets to the nub of why I am feeling so disturbed, because (as some people will know from my previous posts) I have made a trigger out of my wife (on some days the sight of her can trigger of the """"""""Do I / don't I love her"""""""", """"""""Do I / don't I find her attractive"""""""", """"""""Am I going to break her heart in to a thousand pieces"""""""" thoughts), being away from her is, in a way, a relief because none of that happens, The trigger isn't there so I don't get the thoughts which, of course, is a relief.
But I hate even writing that. I hate the fact that being away fro my wife can, in a sense, be a relief.
Then things get really difficult when I ring home at the end of the day, and am trying to sound and behave normally when I have all this OCD anxiety flying around my head and heart (though my wife couldn't possibly have been more sympathetic and understanding about my OCD, I don't practise my confession-rituals with her anymore...I know that way further anxiety lies).
I know I've come a long way with my ROCD and, for that, I am very grateful. I know I've got to learn to be away from my wife for work. I hate it but it's true. I must learn to be ok with not being able to touch her, tell her I love her, do things for her to show her, demonstrate to her how much I love her. In my line of work, being away from home is something which is unavoidable if you want to make money. And I do want to make money so I can give my wife a better quality of living.
I am sorry to report that, no matter how many times I go through OCD ambushes and come out ok the other side, whenever a fresh ambush occurs I find I am pretty much back to square one.
I am, however getting better at just living with the thoughts as if they are not there (somebody once compared it to getting used to the noise of low-flying planes if you live next to an airport, which really helped me).
I feel a little better having posted. I am heartened to see postings from other people whose OCD centres on their relationship / marriage.
I just need support right now so I am reaching out.
God bless you all and thanks for taking the time to read,

"Hello everyone,
I hope this finds at least some of you at peace and happy.
I'm going through a bad time at the moment. It's a carbon-copy of an episode which really brought me to my knees in 2009.
My OCD currently centres around my marriage, the most important thing in my life. I have super-strict rules about my behaviour with women.
8 years ago, I got scared about a woman I was working with. I really don't know why. It was a combination of """"""""Do I find her attractive? / Am I in love with her? / Is she after me?"""""""". I'd known this woman a .long while but then she became my boss and that's when the weirdness started happening. Whenever I was around her I would get this whoosh of terror. This feeling made me even more scared because it kind of resembled the feelings one gets when one is around someone one really fancies. It was awful, I became significantly suicidal and I had to practise very aggressive exposure therapy to get over it. I still work with that woman now, and have absolutely no issues with her whatsoever, which is fantastic.
Anyway, exactly the same thing is now happening with another woman at work. The last episode was so appalling that I was praying to God I'd never go through anything like it again. I'm getting exactly the same whooshes of terror. I've been practising the 4 Steps and for a while they were really working. I've been saying to myself, """"""""It's not me, it's my OCD"""""""" and refocussing. Like I said it was really working but the last week has been very painful and exhausting. Every time I see this woman, a new image gets stuck in my head and it's started to grind me down terribly. I think part of what is so exhausting is that I know I'm going to be seeing her every day. Maybe that's a key point: my OCD has fixated on a woman from whom there is no escape, so to speak. She's a really nice person and, yes, I do think she's attractive, but I come in to contact with any number of nice and attractive women but can usually just walk away.
I must get in to a space where I am GLAD that I'll be seeing this woman each day, as it'll give me the chance to conquer the terror.
It's so dreadful sharing about this stuff because I get terrified people won't understand. The bottom line is that I'm very happily married and am not interested in intimacy with any other women. I suppose when a woman is kind and approaches me / if I think she fancies me (and no I don't think I'm God's gift), it also throws me in to a panic because it transgresses my """"""""rules"""""""" around women, so to speak.
I'm trying really hard to practise the 4 Steps, not avoid her and not practise any confession rituals with my wife.
Please help and support me. God knows I need it. Also, I would be so appreciative to hear from others who've experienced this sort of manifestation of OCD. Feel free to private message me.

"Hey all.
I joined this forum in I think April of last year (so nearly a year ago), I got some great advice from some members of this forum. But since then, my OCD has got a lot worse.
When I joined this forum I was only just coming to terms with my OCD, only then was I really starting to understand it. I suggested I go to a Doctor or tell some family members, I did neither, but I did tell a friend which was nice.
Anyway, the members on this forum were really helpful (thanks for that), and I said I would come back and give everyone an update, but strangely the OCD has stopped me, but now it's getting beyond, it's driving me crazy, so here I am. Over the last year my OCD has been getting worse, I think me recognising it made it worse, but I'm ok with that. The rituals are still going on, a new one nearly every week, the horrible thoughts have started happening (that wasn't happening at first) and it's driving me crazy. I'm thinking to myself """"""""has it really been a year"""""""" and I've done nothing.
Sorry to go on and on, I just need talk about it. Today I've been really angry and depressed, everyday I worry about OCD, a day hasn't gone by in the last year without saying the word.
It's just been really depressing me lately, not every day is horrible, but each day still involves OCD. It would be great if someone could give me advice on what to do, I would really appreciate it.","['Rituals', 'Thought', 'OCD']", [‘horrible thoughts’],"['Thought', 'Rituals', 'OCD']",1.0,1.0,1,1, horrible thoughts
"I'm having some issues at the moment and I don't know whether it's OCD or not.
The first problem is with one of my 'themes', specifically if someone mentions it in a topic of conversation or it's on the news - I start to panic and think that they are thinking of me in association with it. Does anyone else feel like this? Part of me wants to ask if people geniuinely see me in this light or if it's all in my head. I'm not sure. 
The second problem is to do with something else. I'm not sure if this is at all related to OCD. I have this problem where my mind will get stuck on something that I haven't achieved yet that others have at my age. I start to panic and believe that I'll never be able to do this and therefore be seen as some type of outcast. I've spent the last hour reading articles, forums and statistics about this. I feel so embarrassed by it - by all this worrying because it never used to bother me before a few months ago and I am genuinely considered about this. I don't know whether this is ocd or just a general worry.

"Hi everyone,
So I'm back on the forums after a bit of a break ...
I'm really struggling. I've not felt this hopeless for a long, long time.
The problem is, it's all my own doing. My past actions haunt me from morning till night.
I went through a very few weeks in my life. I was so fed up with battling my own thoughts, I was so fed up of trying to convince myself I was a certain person ... I thought I would just accept I was that person ...
It led me down a disgusting road. I thought I would feel more comfortable accepting those aspects of my character. I tried to accept and confirm who I thought I was in certain ways; ways in which I look back on and it makes me so ashamed. It's real shame. Not pretend. Not just words to appease people. It is real deep shame and disgust.
But don't they say people with OCD never act on their fears?
I look back on those couple of weeks, and I really do not recognise that person. Since then, I have gone completely the other way. Weirdly, my initial fears that led me down that road have now gone. Hand on heart, I have no desire to repeat what I would do in those couple of weeks. Looking back now I cannot comprehend why I did what I did. It's truly disgusting and abhorrent. But how can I say this and how could I ever expect anyone to believe me?
My actions will stay with me forever despite how I feel now. I cannot believe I was so disgusting.
There is another aspect to it all that has been causing me incredible amounts of heartache. I am particularly fond of a certain famous female musician, and I have had the incredible pleasure of going to see her live a couple of times in the last week or so. To be honest, I worship the ground she walks on. All the time I was at each of the concerts I was thinking, 'if she knew what you'd done, she wouldn't want you here enjoying this'. I can't bring myself to even listen to her music now. I keep trying to work out how I could justify myself to her if I ever managed to meet her. I know this sounds reaaaaally sad, but it is just something I am struggling with. This applies to loads of other things though. I can't bring myself to study because I know my actions have pretty much rendered my future obsolete. What is the point in trying to better myself? I try and seek approval and love from people. But it's the kind of thing that people wouldn't be able to see past.
Simply, what is the point in doing anything when you consider that, if people knew what you had done, they wouldn't really care whether you lived or died? I really am the lowest of the low.
For those few weeks I have no idea what had gotten into me. Most amazingly, I see that sort of behaviour more shocking and disgusting now than I ever have in my life. Plus, it seems to have completely placated one of my biggest themes. But the fact remains that I did some not very nice things. And if people got wind of it, then they would run with it and nothing I could ever say would convince them I was no longer that person. Even though, speaking honestly to all you guys on here, I am really not that person. As I say, I cannot understand what happened to me.
I struggle to relax. I don't find any enjoyment in anything. I can't sleep. But I can't seek help. I had a really worrying experience and many of you may know.
I seem to spend the majority of my day feeling down. I ruminate about what I did and try and find a way to justify it and how I would to others. But there is no justifying it. I really don't think anyone would understand or give me another chance.
For the first time in a few years I have had thoughts about taking my own life. I'm not convinced that I ever would. But I have pondered how nice it would be to be free of all this.
Sorry for being vague, but given the nature, it's probably for the best.
I hope you're all well.","['OCD', 'shock', 'hope', 'fear', 'joy', 'shame', 'Thought', 'disgust']",['theme'],"['OCD', 'shock', 'fear', 'Thought', 'joy', 'disgust', 'shame', 'theme', 'hope']",1.0,,1,0,
"Hi All
Went to great yarmouth last week which was brill for having the break considering 5 and a half weeks in the house with the kids over the holidays cos of the weather etc but last week the weather was brill. Anyway day before holiday I went to see doctor and I freaked cos she said in the past I had depression which as you know I link to my fear of suicide too so I need to break that link anyway after I left her I was thinking what if I killed myself what if I walked into the road etc etc and this freaked me out and sent me into a state of panic I took two kalms and eventually calmed down this bloomin OCD
My partner reckons cos Im a nervous passenger I was dreading travelling too on the saturday but I got through it I didnt sit at the front for the whole trip when I got to the holiday caravan I was like feeling a little negative so I stuck up for myself with OCD and the week was okay so it was better than I thought tho I did take my book tormenting thoughts and secret rituals with me to tide me over and to remind myself its OCD!! Anyway got back on Saturday and I was okay til I got near home then I was thinking back to the old routine oh how boring blah blah blah what if I get my OCD thoughts and I have to face the facebook page where a friend whos sister killed themselves is still on there and that will make me feel sick etc etc too so Ive been a bag of nerves and Im not sure at times if its OCD or its just me my partner says well I created the OCD to cope a very long time ago and I havent let go of it and if only he could show me how I am at times because of it but Im finding it weird being back home when I still have a lot of work to do to this house etc Im due on my period at the end of the week and I really dont think its helping at all and Im just concentrating on keeping myself distracted so I dont dwell on OCD too much but then I hear in my head things like well you live on your own with the kids so its back to that blah blah blah making me doubt myself alot is this really OCD people?????

"Hello everyone
How are we all doing?
I'm just back from holiday in Pisa with my dad and brother. It was really lovely and we had a fantastic time. We were out in nature and it was really calming and helped clear my head.
I had a chat with my Dad and brother on the last night and told them I had been struggling with everything. They were both very sympathetic - even though I was crying in the middle of a lovely restaurant we had gone to! - and told me that the worst had happened in that we had lost Mum and were all still dealing with that. So that helped. They also assured me that I wasn't alone and they loved me.
Which means a lot. Today I held the rumination and mental cycles at bay; it sounds silly, and it was a little exhausted, but I distracted myself with nice thoughts and images. My dad told me he feels I live in my head a lot and I need to focus on what's going outside. Which is true, because, well. I did have trouble engaging on occasion, so caught up was I with mental rumination. I did my best, though.
I'm going to be brutally honest and tell you guys what's going on with me. I am struggling now with the problem of sexual fantasies about family members - which I do not want. After the initial panic, I just steeled myself and let the thoughts come and go - although rest assured I don't want them! - and then I felt a lot less bothered.
However, there was old stuff and it's something I'm still struggling with, four years down the line. I know I sound pathetic and I think the time has come to seek proper help, because I feel this anxiety in my bones and it actually physically hurts, especially when it comes to my writing because I'm not sure what to write and what not. I've just decided to finish a story i began four years ago but because I've changed in myself since then, I'm not sure if it's 'allowed' if I'm allowed to carry on with it, as it's a romance and well, at present I'm rather rigid with myself and I don't think I like myself as a human-being.
The reason I'm so worried is the thoughts I've had before that I've let myself have and they're been clear in my head and because they were not exactly intrusive, I feel guilty and that aids the cycle. They were a promise thought, hence the guilt and the me thinking 'Should I try and stand by this?' and so I have governed myself for a long time - the problem though, while it feels like OCD, I'm not sure if it's genuine conscience talking as well and my thoughts don't feel at ease, they feel rather stiff, like I've governing from one thought to another and it makes me anxious because I'm not sure what I'm allowed to think and what I'm not and it makes my chest very tight. What I'm allowed to do and what not. My Dad said I seem to control everything, to control my thoughts and he's right - I can't just let myself be and let myself think naturally; I feel very tense and stiff in my own skin and can't quite relax, although today I felt less edgy because I was being defiant against the doubt. I was letting myself be a bit naughty, I was letting myself think thoughts I was normally edgy about thinking. I went into a Cathedral yesterday and I wondered if God was speaking to me, telling me what to do - I felt something and I wondered if there was something I needed to do that I wasn't sure I could/wanted to do, but I wondered if it was the answer I was looking for. I feel this would affect my writing and would mean I couldn't finish this story, which I've just had proof-read to detail; so if I find at this point I can't finish it, because I'm not allowed, then that would be wasting someone else's time.
I hope I haven't lost hope. Sometimes I wonder if I was even meant to be on this planet after all; maybe I wasn't supposed to be born? But I feel if I were to end it, then wouldn't that be upsetting for my family? (not to sound egotistical, but...) I've been here once before; this feels like OCD territory but it feels scarier than ever because everything is different, everything has changed and I just don't feel I can trust myself to make myself happy. I have wondered if it was better to end it than keep struggling on, but surely I can hold on a bit longer? I wondered, genuinely, if my family would be better off without me growing up, crying constantly and being an anxious mess in my old age and they would be happier for it?
I feel pathetic that worry over a few thoughts which might not mean anything has done this to me over the last few years, as I've tried harder and harder to fight it, it just feels like I've sunk deeper and deeper into quicksand. I've been crying a lot more, feeling a lot more anxious, feeling clingy, wanting constant reassurance from people and feeling unable to engage. I feel a coldness inside my bones and I'm very scared for myself and my future. I feel I'm judging others, that I'm not a nice person, that I'm damaged and bad because I seem to want to worry all the time - it's like I want things a certain way so I can worry. But all the anxiety has led to a depression and loneliness I can't seem to escape and which has made me very sad and tearful.
I think I might know what my old psychologist would say; he's a theologist as well as a psychologist and he's retired now. I wish he could tell me what to do but what if I just can't keep myself happy and trust myself in my own skin? I know a thought is just a thought and none of us are saints and God knows this but it's like I keep pushing myself to the edge - what if I can do this, what if I can do better and do better than I'm doing now but the very idea of pushing myself further puts a tight something in my chest. I've come to believe more in God than in an organised religion, per say, because I've realised you don't have to be a Christian to be a good person although I do still think of myself as Christian. Even if I can't be a perfect or a devout one, I'd like to be a good one and I don't want to let God down and I want to do the best I can by Him to just be a good person and show love and compassion to others and even if I don't go to church every Sunday, remember that I am cared for. At the moment though, I'm hearing all this stuff in my head and I'm not sure what to think: I hear 'you are a wicked girl' and 'this is temptation' and 'no, this is a sin,' which I fear is part of being judgey. I don't want to be judgemental, or a horrid person, but I do want to do my best and take some of this numbness and pain away. I'm worried that rumination has become a habit, or a hobby; I keep going around in circles. It does feel like depression and I don't want to go on Prozac, but I'm scared to seek help because what if I'm unable to describe my fears in a way that helps me feel safe? What if I can't be helped and it's all just a waste of time? What if I don't like the person? I've struggled to speak of my fears, because I'm scared I'll make it worse.
I realise I'm very hard on myself, but I'm proud of myself for today, for keeping that vicious cycle at bay. I realise God wants us to be happy, but right now I'm feeling very afraid that whatever happens, I won't be able to cope and feeling like a huge big ball of stress, deep down and that stress won't be moved.
I realise this is a lot to take in and I'm sorry to sound so crazy; you must all think I'm silly and weird. I just haven't been able to shift my thoughts and I'm very afraid now, because everything feels more real and it feels as though there's more to lose. Which is frightening; more than anything, I'm scared of utterly losing my will to live.

"Hi
This period the sea is getting real cold and so i returned from my summer house to the city of the civilization and my pc and other comforts.
Hapilly i left it in much better condition that i found it.I mean it's less than a jungle now....Actually i found only one small snake a few rats that my cat captured a big disgusting spider that visited me once and the usual residents of my house the lizards....This has to do with the following ocd story i'm going to recite.
Arriving there i found the flora as a real jungle around my house,something that brought me back painful anamnesis from immense snakes and other animals in the past. So i called a worker who can fix nearly everything but nothing very well.(however he's the only one i could afford since he's really cheap)
His face is exactly the one of the old scientist in Andrei Tarkovsky's movie 'Solaris'(one that Leonardo Da Vinci would be the happier man to have as model)and he reminded me costantly the ocd but i managed not to think of it....When i went to his house to close the deal we shaked hands and looking at his hands i saw they were absolutely black from dirt and i remembered he almost never wash them.
I felt it was a good warm up for the 'therapy' that expected me the next days.
Actually the next day he come home early in the morning screaming with his strident voice and hitting my door with all his power since i don't have a bell....
I waked up made him a coffee while he put out his machine for the flora and started to work....The one coffee brought the other(he's really obsessed with this)and the consequence was to do his need over a corridor of cement,he has constructed himself in the past,i have to lead me to the sea throught the jungle....Then he continued his job touching his machines and some tools i gave him without washing his hands giving me them after that to help him I asked him why he didn't wash his hands and he asked me in his turn if i was a sensitive person....I said my self it's time for therapy i'll try to keep it for a time....In the next hour while making the twelfth coffee i heard a scream and getting out i saw him coming with his blooding hand and a grimace of pain...He had fallen over a wasp nest and one had bited him....He said he was allergic to the wasp and i brought immediately an apparatus i have for the snake bites.I hold his disgusting unwashed,blooding,swollen hand, applied the apparatus underpressure for half an hour and pulled out the sting.He declared he couldn't continue in this jungle it was dangerous for his life working there and that i had to continue myself....I did so until late and then exhausted i got to sleep....
The next morning he came in the usual manner for installing a water-closet in the bathroom....I gave him a floor cleaner to clean whatever he could and he washed his hair with it!!!!As he got up the soffit to pass a tube down to the bath he asked me to bring some tools from his car....Coming back i heard a very strong sound and getting into the bath i saw a big hole in the ceiling and important quantity of cement and stones into the toilette bowl.... :eek: I called him down with an angry voice and asked him to pull all this stuff out the bowl....He answered he no way could do this disgusting thing and i asked him on my turn if he was a sensitive person....The next hour found me getting out all this stuff putting my hands inside the bowl(i had no gloves at the moment) insulting the worker who had change a thousand of colors on his face....
After that i stayed into the sea swimming for two hours until i felt i was clean enough....
It was a real trial for me but i surely got stronger out of it....Sometimes the need is the better therapy........

"Hi All,
So after successfully beating harm OCD last year I have unfortunately ended up back in the clutches of OCD. I had a lot of stress toward the end of last year and that turned into anxiety again which then turned into OCD again despite my best efforts not to allow it to. Now I am stuck in this seemingly endless cycle of fear and rumination and it seems every thought I have or thing I do is stained with this awful series of thoughts.
So onto the new theme. Existential fears. I cannot for the life of me seem to shake this one. It eats away at me every day and saps my motivation and makes me feel awful.
Has anyone on here ever suffered from this theme and overcome it? To me it seems like the ultimate OCD theme and it has completely crushed me.
I guess I am looking for some support and some hope that I can overcome this as right now I feel at an all time low with it.
Hope others are doing well and moving forward.","['anxiety', 'anxiety', 'fear', 'Thought', 'hope', 'OCD']","['rumination', 'theme']","['rumination', 'anxiety', 'OCD', 'fear', 'Thought', 'theme', 'hope']",1.0,,1,0," I am stuck in this seemingly endless cycle of fear and rumination and it seems every thought I have or thing I do is stained with this awful series of thoughts.

"I can stand this anymore i have been away for ten days and all the time have been battling with myself to try and find a meaning to my feelings and thoughts.
I am still looking at people thinking there skin and bones it makes me feel like i have no respect for people and makes me think even more that it means that i will hurt them in some way.
I am finding hard to focus i look at someone and start imagagining what sort of lives they have at home.
I bet they do not have to go through what i go through.
On top of it all i still do not think that this is ocd and i think i am delusional what with all these weired fantasies going on..and then thee is the deppression.I met up with my brother for the first time in to yrs just for two days and all that time i was thinking i have to leave him and go back home.that made me so sad and cried when i said bye to him few more times in the hotel room and even when i got back tyo my own country,he will never know how much i miss him...
I feel like i have wasted my holiday and am again back to me trying to surrvive each day at work with theses thoughts feelings and anxiety feeling.
All the time i look on hbere for people with similar thought patterns to me even though i knowi will never find anyone.
It worries me to think that i am having these feelings about people,what does it mean? itried to read a book about ocd called""""""""ocd and me"""""""" and that just made me worse getting more spikes from the book and taking on the persons symptoms....AAHHHHHHHHHHHH i can not take it any more.i am never going to be normal i have had this over half my life now it is getting that i can not remember the way i was-....

"Oh god. I'm back at a very bad place after a session with my therapist. He basically said that all kinds of thoughts and fantasies are ok. Well this got me thinking: Does he think I'm actually a pedophile? Does he think I'm sick?

It got worse when he revealed that my brother had contacted him (I don't know if he was even allowed to do this). I've noticed the neuroticism in my brother and it has made me really depressed. Judging from his behaviour, I think he might be struggling with the same themes as I am. The thought of this makes me very uncomfortable.

I need to get out. I've spent the last 3 hours on google, googling teenage girls of different ages, evaluating whether I could or could not feel any attraction towards them. Obviously this just makes me feel like a sick ******* even more, even though they're just normal pictures. I want this testing to end. It just makes me severely confused.

My brain tends to start the testing process quite easily. It takes a thought, twists into something completely else, until I'm very confused and start to even feel some attraction. This dynamic is really hard to explain. Rationally I know sexuality isn't that black and white and that our brains don't really care for societal rules that much. Still I feel like I should get a definite answer, so I could feel safe around people. I fear that I'll abuse someone otherwise.

My real experiences make the situation all the more confusing. When I was 22, I almost ended up in bed with a 17-year old (legal here and I was aware of her age). Nothing came out of it (luckily), but it's turned into """"""""evidence"""""""". I'm just really really confused and think this might not be even OCD at all.

Also I think I should change my therapist. He's a psychoanalyst and I'm not sure if he quite understands me.

"I have been having a bad day, I think only some big huge positive life changes will ever be able to change all of this. Until then (if ever) I feel things won't change.
I have been trying to contain rumination to a small time period- 'worry time'. But sometimes it is just impossible, what's the point in waiting for worry time and then making yourself stop when you don't like yourself all of the time? Which is worse? Depression and self hate when not ruminating or ruminating to make yourself feel better for a while. Its either not ruminate ands accept my actions and therefore despise myself and be depressed OR ruminate.
I have spent a large proportion of today ruminating about calming signals in dogs. As my dog showed them and submissive behaviour when you spoke to her, walked up to her or stroked her, I feel that she must have always been uncomfortable- at the very least. What kind of life was that for her? I have spend ages trying to convince myself that this is a part of normal dog body language, like a stranger smiling at another stranger. But I don't believe it.
I don't think I will ever feel differently about my affect on my dog. My old topics of rumination e.g. my ex boyfriend, I now realise don't matter (only because I have a new boyfriend) but I still feel that the topics are truthful and what happened was real.
I am mostly here to rant, I have had so much support from everyone on the forum and I know there is little more that anyone can say to me. Not that I think anyone will write anything to intentionally hurt me (I know that you guys are so nice and wouldn't want to make my situation worse), but please don't unintentionally write anything that you think could make me worse as I can't take much more of this.
I am having counselling and on medication. I spoke to the Dr and told him that my change of meds (about 3 months ago) don't seem to have made a difference. He basically said that the medication might not and I might have to, in his words, 'face the music'. Hmm, sensitive.

"Hi all,
I'm not sure why I'm doing this because my head is so messy I don't know if I can write anything that makes sense!
I've had a really bad day - I've been having quite a few recently. It's been a stressful time lately and my OCD is having a free-for-all. A week or so ago I had a worry about being in contact with some blood on some paperwork at work and possibly catching something (i.e. HIV). I don't care about myself getting ill - I'm scared because I know this thought is going to make it harder for me to be with my little nieces because I worry about hurting them by accident anyway. My brain seems to be trying to come up with new and more horrible ways that I could be a danger to them!
I never thought I would worry about HIV because I felt I knew the facts about how it can be caught. I made the mistake of looking on the internet for reassurance and, of course, I found things to make me doubt what I thought I knew. Now the doubts are crowding in: maybe the blood wasn't actually dry and maybe I transferred it to myself via my nose or eyes or little cuts on my fingers. I keep getting variations on this same theme. I've sought reassurance from my GP and today form the occupational health department at work. Trouble is, every time a new way I might have transferred it to myself occurs to me, I want to seek reassurance all over again!
Today I saw some more blood on some paperwork and the anxiety got out of control. I get this sudden rush of warm, tingling all over my body. I know this is adrenaline being released but as soon as that happens any hope of keeping things under control goes out the window. I end up shaking and crying (and making a fool of myself!). I can usually cope with the thoughts but when I get this sudden physical reaction it gets away form me.
I'm very worried about Sunday - when I'll next see my niece. I'm more worried about the anxiety and not being able to cope with it than I am about actually passing any illnesses on to her! If I worry, there won't be any way to check that she's okay, and this seems like an impossible situation to be in. I know I've only got myself to blame for letting it get this bad, because I've always sought reassurance from my sister that everything's okay, but of course it's not going to work in this case because she won't know if I've passed anything on to my niece.
When I read this back I can see how much it looks like OCD (rather than any real problem) but my mind won't believe it's nothing to be worried about.
I'm so frustrated with myself because I've had OCD for a long time... I should be able to see it for what it is and deal with this by now! But being cross with myself isn't helping. Things seem to have got a lot worse since my Grandma died and I developed a couple of OCD thoughts that I might have caused it. I have pretty much got on top of those, but I'm missing her a lot because she really made me feel that I was loved. No one else in my family shows this in the same way. Aghh... just feeling sorry for myself now!
I didn't mean to write this much. I just need to feel I'm not on my own with this.

"I just feel like I don't know what to do anymore. I struggle so much with bible verses that seem to suggest a limit to God's mercy, and with the verses about dividing people up, and I don't see what I'm supposed to do with all the worry I carry.
I feel like I don't know what I think about God anymore, because I am so afraid. I don't seem to feel the peace that other people go on about, and my attempts at reading the bible usually end up with me in tears. No matter how many times other christians tell me that the overriding theme of the bible is God's love and redemption, I still get incredibly upset by the verses that talk about judgement or some of the parables that talk about people failing or choosing the wrong path or whatever.
I seem to have an underlying feeling that God is good and loving, such as when I listen to worship music, hear the footprints story, or see love in others (and most of all my family), but I struggle with going to church and reading the bible, and feel that even when I'm happy I have this deep-seated worry just waiting to re-surface.
People keep telling me that I need to have faith and trust in God, but I can't seem to do that, and I don't know if that's because of the way my OCD affects my relationship with Him. I don't understand why I feel like this, why I react to church the way I do, and why the bible seems so harsh to me but not to others. I have a naturally enquiring mind and question things all of the time, which I think is healthy and good for having a meaningful relationship with God, but then I worry that I question things and also about the fact that I'm not satisfied with the answers I get. Each time I have a panic attack I get myself in such a state and have the thought that I've been forsaken in some way. Then, the very fact I've thought that makes me realise I'm doubting God's love and goodness and then I worry about what I think of God.
I worry that I'm not saved, and that very fact makes me worry even more that I'm not (as it's like I'm not trusting). Thus it is a vicious cycle that I can't seem to break out of.
I feel like I can't think properly and little things feel like big decisions, such as today I went to a new church and decided before I went in that I wouldn't take communion, (partly just because I'm used to my other church) and then after it had finished I felt like I had made a choice not to 'eat at the feast' or accept the invitation to the table at God's kingdom or whatever, and that I'd separated myself in some way.
I had a panic attack in the middle of church and ended up in tears! (Good first impression...)
Is this part of my OCD?
I feel really in the depths of despair at the moment - I can't concentrate on anything else. My mum and Dad have been super supportive but just have no more words for me. They just keep saying that God loves me and I don't need to fear, but that's not what I feel inside and I can't seem to trust what they tell me.
Any advice or support would be so appreciated. I know that this is so specific, and hope that people who aren't christians can still sympathise with how OCD affects things like this.
Everything in my mind seems to go at a 1000 miles an hour, and when I feel like my thoughts and actions have eternal consequences, the anxiety just seems to spin out of control. Have any other Christians out there been through anything like this, or known anyone who has? I need some hope that I can get through this and trust God (and be happy again!)

Is it normal to feel super strong impulses all of a sudden, and almost feel like a different person? Then panic when your normal super careful anxious self comes back?
For around 7 years I have been battling with this current OCD theme.
It will not leave me alone and it wasn't happy until it destroyed me and left me in a constant state of rumination, spikes, depression and hopeless.

Can impulses and urges and OCD in general make you feel like you are a monster and that you go numb inside...usually I'm anxious but for those few seconds I felt numb to it and as I've said before frozen as though the impulse was so strong...but I didn't want to act.
I am afraid I'm a bad person for letting any of this happen.
I'm tired of it. I miss life before this... although before this I was plagued with other forms of OCD , low self esteem and eating phobias etc etc... All bad...but a piece of cake compared to life now.
I want to hear other people with their experience of these weird false (because it's against my will) feelings, urges and impulses, frozen moments, feeling like they aren't themselves, confusion as to how they got that way.
I'm so tired out. I'm praying someone can be there to help me overcome this...i see no light at the end of the tunnel...I feel like it's gonna last forever.

Why did this happen?
Why did I feel odd, and these urges and impulses felt real..

I used to have OCD about the fear of blood and HIV and I had CBT for that and was able to get it under control. But recently I have become plagued by horrible and distressing thoughts randomly entering my head, some of which are to do with past events from my childhood which upset me, recent things and stuff I feel guilty about, but some of it is imagining things that I may or may not do unless I think or behave in a certain way. To give an example of what I mean, late last year my mother took an overdose and tried to kill herself, me and my sister found her on the sofa with a note saying 'Sorry' luckily we rang an ambulance and they sorted her out, she is ok now and hasn't tried anything like it since, or before. She suffers from severe depression and psychosis. That incident might come into my head when I am watching a film or listening to some music and then I start to feel really anxious and often turn it off as I don't want to associate that thought with the said medium I am viewing. That is an example of the OCD when it is something that has happened. But at other times the same thing happens and I get a thought that I might hurt or harm my brother or sister (I love my brother and sister and would never hurt them - I would die for them) yet my OCD tries to trick me otherwise. So sometimes these distressing thoughts are real and sometimes they are about what ifs. I've got to the point where I haven't been to College for nearly 2 weeks because I feel so depressed and anxious. I had an assessment for CBT again last week but I got the impression I won't be seen for months, I know how to sort myself out for OCD things where there are rituals involved with CBT, but I can't control the thoughts that go through my head so I end up just shutting down and staying in bed feeling sorry for myself.

"I am having a struggle right now with something my family doesn't do- which is washing their hands. My mom will go to the bathroom and leave without washing her hands and it makes me feel very anxious.
I was getting the kids ready today to go to the park, had them all dressed and ready and my mom decides to start taking the trash and dirty laundry out of her bathroom, and I don't think she washed her hands after. She went over and picked my son up and held him for a bit and now I feel like I have to bathe all of them and change clothes. It feels like too much effort just to go to the park but I don't want to expose other kids. so staying home it is.

"Hi everyone,
I am a 49 year old woman who has had BDD (including skin picking and clinical depression) since I was 14 (and a half:) ) It's been a long, exhausting, weary journey.
Grew up in one of the former British colonies where there was no help, not even a name for what was going on. Been totally alone with all that craziness, the constant mirror checking, low self-esteem (read here non-existent positive regard for myself) ,self-harm (bleeding, scabby face), excessive makeup/hats/sunglasses, agoraphobia, delusional thinking, suicide idealisation. Lived in my own hellish fantasy land.
Left school with no qualifications and had no means of supporting myself when I walked out of a dead-end job in a shop. My birth father is British, so was able to apply for a British passport and a one way ticket to the UK, arriving here in London in my early 20's. Did menial work until I was in a position to start educating myself.
Am single, have no children and very little family to speak of. A spinster no less. I have had very few relationships and have never been in love. It's been very difficult having people too close, near my face, so it did make having a partner a tad difficult!! I feel this is directly down to having BDD to contend with.
One day when I was 28 years old I went into Waterstones (there used to be a branch in Earl's Court) and was looking through the books in the Psychology section. Came across 'The Broken Mirror' by Katherine A. Phillips. Started to leaf though it and realised this woman was speaking directly to me and about people like me. I went back to my studio flat and read it in one sitting. To say that book had an impact on me would be an understatement!
Everything then fell into place and made sense.
Will never not have BDD but it is now manageable. I was so worn down by all the carry-on, having reached rock bottom. After reading 'The Broken Mirror' started to do my own research and challenge myself. Could call it my own CBT treatment plan:) I may now come over as quirky with a few strange habits, but I blend in. It did not used to be the case. My life was a train wreck for decades and I sometimes wonder how I managed to get this far.
The reason I'm here is because of the direct consequences of BDD and the life choices made. Even though I have moved on and am now unrecognisable from that vulnerable young women I was, I spend a lot of my free time alone. I don't have a problem with my own company but it would be nice to sometimes have a connection with other people who have some understanding of the impact of having lived and still living with this mental illness.

"Hi - Im new to this site. I have become increasingly preoccupied with my hair over the past few years and its now got to the point where its wrecking my life. Ive always had very fine straight hair and have always kept it short because its unmanageable when longer. It looks bizarre all the time no matter what i do with it.I am constantly washing and restyling it - sometimes up to 5 times a day on a bad day but it never looks right. When its really bad I get panic attacks and end up ringing differnet hairdressers to try and get it made better. It looks Ok for a couple of days then the cycle starts again. Im spending money I cant afford on hairdressers and Im sure they think Im weird because I constantly ask when they are cutting it if its even. I have highlights and when my roots show through that panics me horrendoulsy - even though logically I know if you colour your hair you are always going to get roots. I know this all sounds really bizarre but its causing me immense distress. I check my hair in the mirror constantly, take pictures on my phone to try and see what it looks like to other people etc and it seems to be all i think about from morning til night. Im glad to go to sleep just to get a break from it. My mother is always quite critical of my hair - tells me its too short or the colour is wrong and I think that might be where it stems from. Anyway - Id love to hear from anyone who might have some similar concerns. Ive tried to talk to my doctor but he just doles out antidepressanst which dont seem to be working. I dont know whether its nconnected but I have other rituals that i do - before i go to bed I check the doors/windows are locked/ovens turned off several times or else I can't sleep.

"Hello people
Been a while and life was pretty good, I had put myself at about 95% cured and really should have done the hard work for the last 5% but of course, as I suspect most of us do we think...most is good enough!
Except I caught myself struggling again over the last few days with lots and lots of rumination about work ( in terms of terrible thoughts this is about a 5/10 and I have had worse issues with my OCD but I now put myself at about 80% recovered as my mind is constantly ruminating over how conversations with people are going to go). I'm trying to work out how these conversations are going to end and of course this is futile as my mind cannot physically cope or work out.
So I'm on recovery again, listening to the 4 steps again and its great to hear its been updated, I feel slightly better after listening to about 50 minutes and just need to crack on with recovery.

"Hi Folks,
I have contamination OCD and believe I always will, but I have been in control of my OCD for 4 years now. Today it was my sisters turn to host Christmas, this is something I wouldn't have coped with before so I am pleased I went and spent a great day with my family.
My sister has a large dog and two cats, her maroon carpet looks black from pet hair and ground in dirt. The pets are allowed on the furniture and whilst we were there the cats jumped up onto the dining room table a few times. The cats jumped up and kept putting their bottoms in my face and sat licking their bottoms, and the dog sat on my foot a couple of times. Everyone else fusses the cats and stroked from the base of the cats tail (right next to their bottom holes) to the tips of their tales. I find it a bit revolting but coped well telling myself it is perfectly normal and that everyone else does it and its fine.
I made a point of not washing my hands after petting the animals and at one stage the dog licked my finger as I was eating so I just carried on eating. The toilet was grotty, there were lots of pubic hairs at the back of the seat, but I just sat down and got on with it! Later my auntie told my sister that the dog had fouled on the gravel at the front of the house, something I could have done without knowing, my sister said she would clean it up in the morning. I just made sure I didn't step in it on the way out and got in my car. I also took my gifts which were in a carrier bag on the floor and put it in the boot of my car.
Before my ERP 4 years ago I wouldn't have gone inside the house. If I did I would have taken something clean to sit on. I wouldn't have been able to put anything from inside the house into my car. I certainly wouldn't have eaten there. I couldn't accept Christmas gifts from my sister in the past because of what her house is like. So today was a big deal, I am glad its over, but at the same time I know I could do it again.
Happy Christmas folks.

"I have been feeling vastly better this year - I put it down to my therapy, meds, and just being more busy. The main theme of my ocd is 'pure o' about being homosexual. I have recently become involved with a girl after a long time of not even feeling in the position to do so, a sign of my ocd improving dramatically. We have arranged to do something tomorrow. However over the weekend my OCD (or what I hope is OCD...there's the doubt ha) about being gay has crept back in and cause huge doubt over 'whether i really like this girl' or not etc. etc.
Now I'm really worried about this date tomorrow. Worried that I'll feel a fraud 'because I'm really gay'. However last week, I wasn't thinking any of this, just enjoying it with her etc.
Should I still see her? What should I do? I am seeing my therapist on Wednesday, kinda wish I was seeing him tomorrow morning. Also, I didn't get new meds after they ran out, they're on the way, and I've had a ****** cold. I haven't taken my meds in a few days, could this also be contributing to this situation?

"Hi
I have been basically free from any severe OCD for the last couple of years. I now feel as if I am swinging back into it.
Since Saturday I can feel the OCD creeping back in, worries spiralling out of control, losing hours of my day to ruminations etc. Saturday was my birthday and didn't go great, as I was driving to my parents I went past my recent ex-girlfriend out with her new boyfriend, which didn't make me feel good. The rest of the day was going okay until my sister made a remark about my parents been upset about her leaving home and it just hit me like a ton of bricks and I instantly began with thought spiralling out of control.
The weird thing is, been aware of OCD I could kind of see what was happening but was unable to stop it. Now 5 days later I am trapped in the cycle of thoughts such as 'my parents will always make me feel guilty for leaving home', 'what if I want to move to another country' , 'I will never even be able to have a holiday' etc etc.
I, perhaps naively, believed that after getting treated for OCD and being okay for so long that I was done with OCD. Now I feel like a total failure, I look at my life ahead and see only me constantly being the victim of OCD and never being able to do what I want to do, being helpless and needing care etc. I seem to have lost the positive vision for my future which this time last week I absolutely had. I feel hopeless and exhausted and don't want to live this life I can foresee.","['guilt', 'hope', 'Thought', 'OCD']",['rumination'],"['rumination', 'hope', 'Thought', 'OCD', 'guilt']",1.0,,1,0,
"I'm sorry, this will be long. If you bear with me it's appreciated. No problem if not!
I have a long history of BPD and OCD. I have had worries about being unfaithful, guilt, cheating and loving someone else since I was 15.
I'm male, 31 and in a loving relationship of 3 years +.
In the last few months we have had quite a few issues and almost broke up. Sex has always been a stumbling block for me (partly BPD related: either super intense and dangerous, or almost stagnant or non-existent when in a committed relationship).
I love my partner, but I am not blind to our issues and problems and the fact we very nearly parted ways a month or so ago. We handled things in a mature, calm way and we both seem determined to give it more time. We are realistic, but also do not want to throw away what we had. There are numerous underlying issues: my OCD, BPD, the loss of her Father when she was 15, her own mental health.
As I have always tried to know EXACTLY how I am feeling at all times and really analyse my thoughts and the REASONS behind them (heya rumination!), I am well aware of the rabbit holes of guilt and how easy it is to fall down them. As such, when in relationships I have always lived in an unhealthy no-female bubble. So, if I find someone attractive, I won't speak to them. I won't be alone with people. I will worry their smell is on me so I shower before touching my partner. 
I am aware of this and in recent years (and especially since our near breakup over the last few months), I have tried to push past this, to beat the fear and accept that my high moral compass may be slightly twisted and that from time to time, I may **** up. I may slightly flirt. I may occasionally indulge in thinking about someone else, wonder what it would be like to be with them, and accept me weird worries about having feelings for someone else as fleeting crushes which will pass. I have tried to take on board the years of CBT. It's hard. Even typing that is hard.
However, I am now worried that I can't tell if I'm being a 'good CBT student', or an ******* using that as an excuse to be a jerk.
As as person, I am a little bit of a flirt, but in a harmless way. Never remotely sexual or presumptuous, but more enjoying making people laugh or being seen as self-deprecating. In the past, I suppose that was my style (urgh) and what I used to endear myself to people, either as friends or romantically. I have always disliked myself, so that was my niche - my way of being myself.
Last year, someone joined my company who I felt instantly very attracted to. I had never spoken to the person before, they were just objectively very desirable. I of course have had this issue before, but this felt different, from the first instant. I am aware it is almost certainly my OCD picking up with something and running with it (I do not believe in love at first sight). I never engaged with the person in an inappropriate way - never accepted social media requests from them, nor spoke to them socially about things. 
This person and I may or may not have things in common. She's attractive, probably into a lot of the same interests as me etc. But I didn't really care about that. I would find myself flirting slightly (perhaps flirting is the wrong word - subtly 'showing off') around them, but no more than I have before with others. I never had any interest in trying to form a meaningful relationship with the person at all.
Today I had to have a one on one discussion with the person, and I had been worried about it for weeks. I wanted to cancel, I wanted to get other people involved. But I didn't. I went through with it, which I was proud about.
The trouble is, I had built this up into such a massive thing, that the moment I sat down with them, I felt this 'presence'. It's only because I had built it up in my head so much, but adrenaline etc was running high. I felt like I was in the presence of something greater, almost forbidden, which is completely stupid.
I couldn't help noticing how attractive this person was still and I couldn't stop focusing on it and how I felt about it. That's fine, I understand it, even if I don't like it. However, I noticed this person had self-harm scars like I do. This started an entirely new circle of thoughts (when I was younger and much more unwell, I would only want to date others who suffered - leading to very poisonous and dark relationships from both sides).
Suddenly, this wasn't just someone I worked with who I found attractive. They were similar to me. They probably understood things. We spoke about work, completely normally. People were around. We had a joke, like I do with most people (attractive or not). Because of the scars, I felt that I could open up more. I made a few self-deprecating comments, comments about being unhappy in a way to allude to the fact I understand mental health. Urgh. Why? That I suppose is an olive branch and flirting. The intent behind it.
But I started thinking """"""""oh, I wonder what it would be like to be with this person"""""""". """"""""In another world, perhaps we would be suited"""""""". """"""""It's a shame I am with someone so I can't explore that"""""""".
At first I thought these are normal thoughts that everyone has from time to time. They aren't good - of course, but as long as you don't act on them, that's ok. Relationships are peaks and troughs. They have highs and lows. I'm just in a low.
But now I feel wracked with guilt and, more than that, just sad. 
I would like to think that the last few months of my relationship struggling is part of the reason I thought like this. I have spent 3 years cutting out any contact with females I feel I may be suited to, or could have a crush on, that the last month or so of having a reduced relationship with my partner (her staying at her's a couple of nights a week, us taking a step back etc) just means that I am acting 'human', and not this weird restricted person.
I don't really know what I'm expecting to get from this. If anything, I'm just ranting. 
I WANT to make things work with my partner, but I am also ok with the fact that they may NOT, even though it is heartbreaking and I love her. I do love her. We just both struggle. Being realistic about it is the only way I can get through. I certainly want to keep trying though and although the thought of being single and then getting to know this other person (who probably doesn't even give a **** about me by the way - in the nicest way!!!!) is tempting in a 'grass is greener' sort of way, I have no plans to try and contact them, speak to them any more than I have to etc.
My trouble is, I'm naturally open, am a bit of a flirt and enjoy making people laugh. Our paths don't cross too much though, so it's fine.
TL;DR:
I am worried I need to tell my partner.
That this 15 minute chat at my desk means I have been unfaithful.
That this is all an excuse for me just being an *******.
That Christmas will be ruined.
That I can't do anything fun now because it will be tainted in my betrayal. I can't listen to music. Play a video game. Text a friend. Buy Christmas presents.
Am I just being human?
Have I crossed a line?
Am I boring you? Yes.
If you have read this far, thank you. If you wish to reply or extend an olive branch (even if it is to call me scum), then thank you.
This makes me feel so ****. And I just want to cut myself so badly for the first time in about 3 years (I won't, don't worry). But I just want to punish myself.
Being human is hard, being in a relationship is hard. Having a twisted moral compass borders on arrogance and is hard.
Much love to all of the strugglers out there.

I think we should bear in mind that the overall message coming from the rumination thread is that the best stopping runmiantion method is to get refocused into dong what you would normally do.
I agree with that, and it certainly bnenefited me in my working environment when I could apply work plus mindful travelling and walking.

"Hello,
Over the last couple of weeks my life has taken some turns for the better, both in an OCD sense and in a more personal (albeit OCD-related) way.
I am currently spending some time in Sweden with my partner, Jim (who used to post on this board, under the username 24/7). Through his support and encouragement, and through my own determination and 'feeling the fear and doing it anyway', my OCD has significantly improved:
- I took my first bath in at least a year, and didn't even have much anxiety surrounding it.
- The time taken for me to have a shower has decreased beyond belief. Whereas previously it would have taken me upwards of an hour at times from start to finish, it now takes half an hour maximum and more often than not only about 20 mins.
- I have a very radical new haircut, and this has not only increased my self-confidence through compliments I have recieved, even from Jim's work colleagues, some of whom I have only met once before, but has also decreased OCD rituals about washing my hair, to the point where they are almost non-existent.
- After taking a shower I don't always put the towel in to wash straightaway
- I have reduced the number of times I wash my clothes
- I have been living with a cat and a kitten since being here. I have some contaminatiion fears around animals and, although I haven't been successful every time, I have definitely begun to overcome these, through following Jim's example of how he interacts with them.
- Although I still have a very long way to go in overcoming my pure-o, I have made a solid start which I hope to build on
- A lot of people on here will be painfully aware that stress etc aggravates OCD. Well, I am in the process of eliminating a source of stress from my life through leaving my University course.
- As of last night, it seems that I have the full support of my mother in what I am doing.
- Jim's mother holds a very senior position with the Primary Care Mental Health Trust and so I am very fortunate to be able to communicate freely with her and discuss with her my next choices etc.
And finally, the best news of all for me:
Jim has asked me to live with him in Sweden and I have said yes! During the first part of next year I will be emigrating from the UK to move here. We are in the process of applying for a residency permit for me here. Assuming that is accepted, I will be able to attend Swedish school to learn another foreign language, a process that will undoubtedly be aided by living in the country where it is spoken. I will also have access to the healthcare system here and will be starting a whole new way of life, with little stress and a lot of happiness.
For the first time in a long while, I have a future that I am excited about and looking forward to .","['anxiety', 'anxiety', 'Rituals', 'hope', 'happiness', 'fear', 'OCD', 'process']",[],"['anxiety', 'process', 'OCD', 'fear', 'Rituals', 'happiness', 'hope']",,1.0,1,1, I have some contaminatiion fears around animals
"Hi All after all the negative posts I've made, I thought I would provide an update on something positive. 
I see my therapist on Monday but they are contactable even when I'm not in a session. 
The session went well but I was still experiencing problems yesterday. 
I contacted them and they replied to me with strict firm instructions that I'm still not following the advise they gave me in dealing with my problem. 
I can't say specifically what they said as it's a theme very close to my heart, but the main ingredients are that I'm constantly analysing everything to try and get the 'feeling' and to reassure myself that the thing I'm worried about didn't happen and what I need to do instead is to zoom out and stop analysing and take a risk and to trust myself and my morals.
And you know what? Last night was the best night I have had in a long long time. I don't feel anxious this morning although I do feel a little strange as I'm still no closer to knowing if the thing I'm worried about (and even then I couldnt even remember what it was I was worried about!!) did or didn't happen...but as I recall Dksea and some others on the forum mentioning to me previously its not about getting answers to our worries..... And I guess its about having a better quality of life at the risk of not knowing if our worries are real or not.... 
Hopefully the above may help others experiencing these problems.

It was obvious to me for some time that he appeared to be
hyperstressed and was prone to severe bouts of
what would seem to be uncontrollable coughing
and shaking.
He is also very """"""""territorial"""""""" in that if I approach
the desk of a team member that is adjacent to where
he sits [for example to chat about a work related
topic], more often than not this will exacerbate
the coughing and shaking and he will get quite
annoyed, and walk out of the partition.
As a result, I generally use IM to
communicate with team members.
I really did not have a clue why this might be
and one day I asked him but found that he
did not want to talk to me about it --
and gave me no useful information. He told me
that this was due to hayfever -- so I tried
to investigate the airconditioning !! - even
though I doubted that this was the real reason.
As an FYI, his work is fine and I have no
problem with him as an employee. He is
generally very good humoured and well liked
amongst the team and company. I would like to
think that I am not excessively tough on my
team members [easy going about starting times,
do not enforce unnecessary deadlines on people,
I dont think I have even raised my voice at
John (or any other team member) in 4 years].
It was only a couple of years later that I
found out indrectly that he had OCD.
I then """"""""googled"""""""" it and found that by
moving John to the edge of partition [nearest
the coridoor] would help his condition. I was
amazed by two things:
(*) Condition improved significantly - but still
is quite bad.
(*) Why could he not say to me that he would
prefer a seat by the coridoor ?.
Why did he put up with so much """"""""suffering""""""""
rather than say 11 easy words: """"""""I would like a seat by
the edge of the partiton"""""""" ????
The partition that we work in is very """"""""open plan""""""""
and quite small and when the symptoms manifest
it can have an effect of stressing those around
him [especially me !].
He has just had a kid (which he is delighted about)
but as you can imagine there is more resposibility
and stress in his life and the above symptoms have
got worse.
I know he finds it very difficult to talk about this
with me [it would be much more straigtforward if
we could have a direct chat] -- so what would
you do in my case ...
How to improve the working conditions for all
concerned !!!?!?!

"Hi folks,
Just wanted to get others opinions on which SSRI (or other med) they found best for treating their OCD?
I'm mainly pure O with some mental rituals and have been on Paroxetine for 12 years at a dose between 20-40mg (currently on 40mg).
Paroxetine does help, but I still seem to slip a bit back into OCD when I'm feeling particularly stressed about something, which is very frustrating.
Does this happen to anyone else?
Also has anyone tried Inositol?","['Rituals', 'OCD']",[],"['Rituals', 'OCD']",,1.0,1,1,m mainly pure O with some mental ritual
"Hi all,
I have had OCD since i was a toddler, Im 32 now...my job is quite stressful and so i booked off 2 wks for Xmas starting last monday...but i cant turn off. I keep thinkning of things over done wrong or things i meant to do. I kept phoning the office...they must think im mad. I have a new assistant who isnt great which is making me more worried about things getting done and i have a constant butterfly in my tummy. My fiance may be losing his job in Jan and we just got a mortgage, finally got our little house and everything was great and now i feel awful. I think im constantly worried about work because if i get the sack we'd lose the house. Anyway i went to see my GP who is lovely and really good with OCD and i said i really cant cope at the moment. The OCD worries are getting beyond a joke, its taking me over an hour to get to bed because of rituals and i am going to end up having another nervous breakdown...I am already on Citalopram but he could see i was in a state and prescribed Beta Blockers, Propanalol. I was a bit shaky and felt so nervouse inside he said it may help. The thing is they just send me to sleep, a deep sleep, which is nice but i have so much on over Xmas and i need to be able to get through it. Also sorry to be gross but i have the rund bad now!! I just wondered if anyone else has been given Beta Blockers and if so then what effect did they have?
Im really struggling...I get one worry about work in my head and i go and sort it out and then another replaces it...i cant believe it, literally i have gone through about 10 mnajor work worries this week...im blowing them up out of proportion...The worse thing was yesterday i was fiddling with my phone and took it off divert (because of and OCD worry) anyway just for one minute and this women rang me with a problem and said my phone shouldnt go through if im off and she had an issue which i couldnt really do much about so i said id try to send an email to help but now im scared i will get the sack for not helping enough....

I've never taken exposures this far, but have read and heard of many people doing the more extreme exposures--putting their hand in a toilet, or not washing hands all day etc

"Hi all,
I was a member here a few years ago and found it so helpful so thought I'd re join to connect with fellow sufferers.
I came off my medication (60 mg fluoxetine) and stopped therapy in September 2013 because after 5 years I finally thought I'd beat my demons: OCD, depression and trauma. My cbt therapist was amazing and I was doing really well in 2013. We both agreed I'd reached the point where she had given me all the tools I needed to cope.
I was doing amazing until after I got married in November 2013. My husband is amazing. However since the wedding I have gone on a downward spiral with my OCD. I wonder if maybe I was so busy with wedding plans that now my head is finding other things to focus on and now it's OCD rituals!
Sorry this is so long!!
Basically I can't go more than five minutes with panic coming over me and unwanted thoughts in my head. As soon as I wake up in the morning I feel fear and anxiety in my chest. It's making me so unhappy and I'm constantly going through things in my head. I feel like my husband deserves someone whose healthy because it can't be nice for him when I'm so quiet and down because so much is going through my head. I'm also withdrawing from my family and my work is suffering because my time is full with going through my rituals. I don't want to burden people with my problems because I want to seem strong.
Usually my OCD has took on one or two rituals at a time but this time it's everything I do or say that becomes a problem. I can't do anything without going through what I'm doing in my head and if I'm interrupted or say it wrong in my head then I have to start again. My checking and going through the past is back with a vengeance too. I constantly feel like Im never going to get back to how healthy I was last year and I feel like I'm disappointing everybody. It's so lonely being sick on the inside.
I've got all the info I need from previous cbt sessions to get better again but I don't know where to start. Can anyone give me an idea or shed some light on their relapse experiences.
Thank you so much!

"Hi Everyone,
I hope you are all well. I'd firstly like to apologise about the subject matter in this post in advance,
I just can't seem to stop confessing, having not done so for over a year to my wife, who I love with all my heart and would rather die than do anything that would hurt her.
On Sat I was using Internet pornography, and while accessing a video, I scrolled down and saw a naked woman on another screen at the bottom. My initial thought was, 'that's nice' of course, and then thought'move away as this is a live link up screen'. Because I didn't navigate away immediately, looked again, before moving away from that screen I feel as if I have been unfairly to my wife and soul mate. I have read about people using these live link fees videos and have read experts saying that they are tantamount to being unfaithful. I told my wife about this, and was honest in my confession, and she said to stop being silly and to forget about it. I can't help but feel I have been unfaithful to her and having confessed twice to this I can't help but feel I have hidden something in the detail of my confession.
I've also had this before, when using pornography where a live link up screen, with a woman on the other end has popped up or been at the side of the screen and because I have seen it and looked again before navigating away from it and having heightened sexual feelings at the same time, I've felt awful and that I have gone behind my wife's back and been unfaithful.
I have strong feelings about these live link up screens and believe that if you go onto them and use them then it is the same as being unfaithful. I know in myself that I was looking at a normal porn videos online and not going onto the net to connect and or watch these women or interact with them, but because I saw and looked at the live link up feed and didn't immediately move away from the screen, before moving away that I have been unfaithful.
I was honest with my wife when confessing, but my OCD won't let me feel convinced about this and I really want to confess again and add in more detail. I'm not 100% sure it was a I've link up feed screen and I said this to my wife, but the more I doubt and go over it I feel as if it probably was. And feel I've now misled her.
This has been a bit of a shock because I have managed to keep my OCD in check for some time and it has left me feeling very depressed just like in the days when my OCD was really awful. Now that I want to confess about this I have begun to remember other spikes, like thinking when faced with a live feed, 'I wonder if she can see me' and getting a twinge down below, is was some time ago and addressed it, but this is the next thing to confess about. I can't believe I'm back at this point again.
Thank you for reading and sorry if any of the subject matters have caused you offence.

"Hello. This is my first post here. I am in my late thirties and have a dual diagnosis of Bipolar and OCD. Over the years I have been very ill at times - there has been at least two, cannabis-fuelled, periods when I have been delusional, and a period when I was suicidal, though I never actually made any attempts.
My OCD has changed over time. I have had Harm, Schizophrenia and Homosexual themes..At the moment, and for the last five years or so, I have been suffering Paedophile OCD, and I think this has to be the worst theme of all. It makes it very difficult to be around children, which is a problem as I have a daughter of a year and a half. I love her to bits and would never do anything to hurt her, but my OCD has, in the past, made me doubt even this.
I have a loving and supportive partner, who is one of only two people who know about my fears. At the moment I am finding it very difficult to be in the company of others who I feel can in some way tell what my fears are. In particular I am having problems with an inlaw and a colleague (I do a small amount of volunteering every week). The fear is that they guess my concern about paedophilia, or that they recognise and do not sympathise with mental illness. What should I be telling myself when I begin to feel paranoid in this way? Is it a common feeeling? It is making life very difficult for me, and making my world very small.
I am due to begin CBT later this year, and have had therapy in the past which helped. But at the moment I am relying on my partner a lot for support (I know she finds it hard), and also on self help books, and reading this forum. I have not smoked cannabis for three years - lookng back I can see that ilegal drugs (including acid/LSD as a teenager) have only ever added fuel to the fire of my distress, even though they made me feel better in the short term
I am currently on a hefty dose of Fluoxetine (anti-depressant), Lithium, and a small dose of olanzapine (anti-psychotic).
Any thoughts and advice would be much appreciated. Thanks.","['Suicidal', 'Thought', 'fear', 'OCD']",['theme'],"['OCD', 'fear', 'Thought', 'theme', 'Suicidal']",1.0,,1,0,

"Hi,
Been doing ok lately but still off work due to back op pain but doing CBT.
I was in the pub  Friday and noticed two girls who approached the bar. One of which I thought looked under 18 maybe 14 to 16 and I thought she looked shy which was endearing and she looked pretty but my mind was shifting between older pretty and younger. I said to self that I need to accept the thought and it's fine to find someone pretty or attractive at such an age ie under 18. I then immediately thought what if she is actually the one person of say 14 I do find I am attracted to as opposed attractive but not attracted to. Then I assessed her and her friend and was ok that they were actually probably 18. I then planned to see the person to be sure and passed them as they came out of the toilets and she def looked pretty 18.
I then made a point of pretending to be on the phone outside near where this girl and friends both male and female were sitting so i could be doubly sure and when one of them made a comment to me after they were asking each other comments (innocent rude funny ones) i asked how old they were and they said 18. Pretty obvious as all drinking and smoking.
So. My issue has been more of one since Friday night. The events then didn't spike me so much but ever since I have freaked that I accepted the initial thought and that I did like a 14 yr old as I said accept it until I thought oh no what if I really do. On the night there was no panic really. Until morning after and since.
I can't seem to recall fact from fiction and am obsessing over replaying events to establish what happened. I'm really freaking out as if it means I've not got ocd and actually I've been lying all these years and if I'd accepted all the thoughts over the years I'd be what I fear.
I've not an issue with thinking someone is pretty etc but I can't recall or recreate the events or thought accurately. Feels like I accepted normal thought then made it odd event with the what if she is the one 14 yr old I will fancy and then the scanning of her age etc kicked in. I know people talk about false memories but I'm not sure if this is when trying to recall events and not being sure what's occurred and inter spacing reality with fears ?
I'm totally lost. Part of me thinks my ocd was never absent as I assessed the person straight away and then said accept ie my ocd was always in play whereas I am thinking it only kicked in once I thought oh no I've accepted the thought and this is the one.
Sorry for the ramble but this has been constant since Friday night. I'm tired.

I have a phychologist, its not going too great, going to suggest CBT and mabye go see my work councillor.

Anyway, a few days of not taken them and i have been definetly feeling withdrawn effects, but i kept going because i wanted to put my efforts into councilling.
So i got a call from my doctors, asking me to come in about my blood results, and i have such a spike and was paniking like crazy, eventually i calmed down and it turns out my iron is a bit low, my doc signed me off work 2 weeks because ive been so so so low.
The 2 weeks is nearly up and I got my doctors tomorrow, i'm not ready to go back to work, but if i do get signed off, i dont know wether to start taking the tablets again, or wether to try and get on without them.
Ive been feeling so sick, and short of breath, but i dont know if thats mabye the low iron.
Ive been crying alot and generally just feeling so ill and fed up. I just snapped abit i suppose, its been years, and ive not been feeling better, so ive just reached the end of my tether.

"Hi,
It’s been a long time since I’ve posted on here. Since then, I’ve done some CBT and I’m still taking some meds. My last CBT session is tomorrow- this isn’t my choice and I can’t say that I’m ready yet but the therapist said that it’s important that I try to work on this on my own for a bit, and not rely on him. I kind of get his point.
Anyway. I thought I was on the mend until a few weeks ago. Work was crazy, I’d started to drink heavily which affected my sleep, which in turn seemed to “turn up” my OCD. I recognise this now and have stopped drinking both alcohol and caffeine.
Unfortunately, I’ve lost my way a little. I have recently been thinking about daft things I did as a teenager with regards to sex/masturbation (sorry, I’m embarrassed even writing it). In a serious rumination session yesterday (I just couldn’t help it) I started googling about embarrassing stuff people did as a teenager in order to in some way seek reassurance that I’m not a weirdo/sicko. Unfortunately, I ended up on a thread on a forums somewhere that was posted by a 29 year old woman about stuff she did and still does (masturbation wise). In an effort to try and find something that I could relate to I scrolled down and then realised that lots of 13/14/15 year olds were replying about stuff they were doing. I can’t remember if I looked at this for long or if I was aroused by it and now I’m going nuts thinking that I must be a Paedophile. I must have been on twenty different sites in the same half an hour trying to seek reassurance about my particular concern but this is the only one I recall there being teens posting (at least graphically and not silly stuff) on- I feel like I almost didn’t notice, I was that busy trying to find someone with the particular thing I can relate with.
The problem is that now I’m stuck on this. I feel disgusting for having read this stuff and I’m terrified that if I was aroused, it wasn’t because there was a 29 year old woman talking about masturbation (it was pretty graphic) but that there were children on there.
I feel awful posting this and I’m terrified that I’m a sicko. That’s the last time I go trawling the internet for reassurance. I know I shouldn’t seek reassurance from you guys…. I was just hoping that someone could say something to make me feel a bit better about myself, as at the moment I feel like scum.

Desperately seeking an answer to the question 'why do I have OCD?' is a colossal waste of time and energy. The reasons are irrelevant. As is succumbing to the temptation to attach blame. It might not be our fault that we have OCD. All that matters though is that we accept responsibility to take the necessary action to manage it. Equally, it doesn't matter how unfair it seems. Or the nature of our particular theme(s). Or how long we've suffered for. All that's important is our willingness to listen to those further along in the process, and to proactively pursue (and to persevere with, even if that means multiple courses of therapy with multiple practitioners) cognitive behavioural therapy. All the rest are just details with which, if we're not careful, we can become bogged down for years.

"To cut a long story short, I got on the bus today, decided hey, lets beat a part of my OCD and move onto the window seat, then, when I wiped my hand over the seat (I always check my seat before I sit down) it got wet and ofcourse I immediatly thought, some kid has been to the toilet on the seat.

Sorry guys, this is one time I thought about stopping myself but I couldn't, no way.
Ran to the sink, washed, scrubbed, didn't feel clean...... now to the point.....
I put a bit of REALLY HOT water in the sink (not too much, enough to submerge my hands, held flat, without touching the bottom) then I put some bleech in the water and scrubbed.
Then I washed my hands in soap loads more times.....................
Anyway, now I'm worried that the bleech is going to do something to me like burn my skin, poison me etc.....
Was there any danger of washing my hands in bleech? Afterall there is a warning on the bottle.

"hi,
Like a lot of people here I've had OCD for a while now- about 13 years. It began with washing my hands 8 times because I was 8 and my uncle was dying, but really took hold when I was 15 and had what in retrospect was a breakdown although I carried on going to school taking days off- I couldn't choose what clothes to wear, what food to eat or even write on this forum and it felt like a nightmare!
In turn each of my family members have been critically ill in hospital (comas, resuscitation, operations, head injuries, cancer, heart problems) and often it has seemed like I just couldn't get the peace to recover from this illness, though I want with all my heart to be free and I know I'm recovering.
This year has been really tricky and I feel so guilty but I haven't been able to take my college exams (after each semester and again just now when I should be taking all of the exams I missed). I emailed my tutor to say I could not take my exams and she's replied about it counting as a failure and now I'm thinking all sort of obsessive thoughts that I somehow prayed for everything to go wrong! the problem is I'm finding it hard to differentiate whether these thoughts are OCD or not!! should I just write them down and recognise them? I wish I could just have some peace and quiet to recover,
Sorry for the selfish post, things are hard and I've just spent a lot of this year completely unsupported physically (no heating, lack of food), financially and emotionally and just needed to write (cos I can!)

Had OCD for 15 years (29 now). Had various therapies and medications and as I guess you might understand OCD tends to fluctuate, I can have 'good' weeks and worse weeks but lately I'm reaching boiling point and every time I try and get out of the house, or lock up at work I go into this delirious anxiety and just can't get it together and end up bawling my eyes out and screaming at myself. I just hate myself so so much and that's not in a 'pity me' way at all - it's in a genuine I HATE MYSELF for putting myself through this way. I have been thinking lately about how much time I've wasted on these rituals (I have checking OCD) and lately its just gotten the best of me. I feel like I don't have the energy to fight it anymore but I know my life would just stop if I didn't. 
I'm starting another round of CBT next week but I am worried about the pressure I'm putting my relationships under as I have to call someone (usually my partner) to get me out of my house/work every day. 
I don't expect a reply. Just good to vent I guess.

"Ive found lately that when ive been using the four steps and letting the thoughts go,after having a good few days,this morning my ocd started bringing back all the spikes ive had over the last week or so,one by one,coming into my mind.I found this really hard to deal with,and have in the past got into a panic attack because of this.Ive found it very hard to let each one go,although i have done that.does anyone else get this? and do u deal with it? its very scary when it happens as it feels like im going mad! It generates a huge panic attack for me very quickly which i cannot stop from happening.Is this because ive been fighting hard against the ocd by using cbt and its now coming back stronger? It makes me feel sick! can anyone identify with this? Its like,when each of the spikes come back,each one feels just as scary as it did when i had it originally.
My head has been doing weird things this week also,like me waking up in the morning and still be dreaming while awake,then going back to sleep into the same dream,and dreaming about my fears coming true.Also the other morning,i dreamt that there was a sound inside my head,and when i woke up,my clock radio was going off,and thats the sound i was dreaming about! am i going insane? sometimes i wonder if im having some kind of mental breakdown.Ive had symptoms of a mini breakdown once before,when i was under huge stress.. i honestly dont know this time though,as it may all be ocd...any thoughts? Also,my spikes are getting even weirder at the moment,i had one today where i was anxious about seeing this guys face,which i hadnt yet seen as ocd said i would fancy him,but i made myself look at him,and felt some anxiety but thats it.Then i looked again and studied him and got anxious and blushed,and the ocd said that meant i fancied him,and i believed the thoughts at the time slightly,even though i knew he didnt appeal to me.ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
One thing that is getting to me right now is how tired i am,exhausted in fact,emotionally and physically.The stress of it all is getting to me,and i cant see a way out of it.I mean general stress,on top of the ocd.I seem to be getting really angry and upset at the issues going on in my life,that i cant see a way out of.does anyone ever feel burnt out? Its odd because when i started the positive thread earlier i did feel like that,but now i feel a bit crappy as my ocd is back and getting to me,and my other stress is coming back.Sorry,just needed to vent that. ps,i didnt post about this ocd while anxious,im past that now.

"I'm not entirely sure why I'm writing this. Later, maybe an hour or so from the time I finish, I'll regret the decision. After all, there are millions - billions - of people out there living, enjoying life, despite far more """"""""pressing"""""""" problems than my own. Yet, here I am complaining. I have been healthy all my life; I've never spent a day in the hospital. Actually, I don't think I've ever been """"""""seriously ill"""""""". I live in a good home with a great family. Really, I'd say I have a pretty comfortable life...
So really, what could be my problem?
I've had OCD in varying severities for as long as I can remember. At its worse, I was falling on my knees in the middle of store aisles, enacting a pseudo-prostration every time I had a less than cheery thought. Of course, I survived and eventually I had brought it under control. A few years ago, I had another """"""""lapse"""""""". I would get panic attacks where I was struggling to breathe. What made it worse was that I knew it was """"""""all in my head"""""""". In effect, I was doing it to myself. The family physician prescribed Zoloft and, sure, it helped. Of course, after awhile, I didn't see a reason to take it anymore. I wasn't sick, after all.
Most of the people I knew from school have moved on to bigger and better things. It's just hearsay though, as I don't really talk to any of my childhood friends. I moved into town with my family seven months ago. I've yet to really get out of the house, save for grocery shopping or quick trips to the library.
I'm nineteen years old; I should be doing things. I don't know what, exactly. I've spent so much time alone that I've grown agoraphobic.
There's nothing stopping me from going out. I could call a cab and be downtown in ten minutes; any day of the week. Yet, I don't. I'm not sure why. I'm afraid I've turned into something I'm not; I've become increasingly reclusive. Creative pursuits have always been an escape for me. Now that I finally have all the resources to write my plays, compose my music, and set up my own photo studio, I'm left sitting there just feeling pathetic.
Recently, I've fallen back into old habits. I've started little rituals and, suddenly, I've dreaded the shower. I see myself in the mirror and I'm...disgusted. I've never had a problem like that. Just a month or so ago, I felt like I was """"""""cured"""""""". I don't know what has changed in that short span of time.
You know, reading this, it all sounds worse than it is. Or, maybe, I just go around in rose colored glasses.
Anyway, I apologize for my lack of eloquence and general mishandling of the English language this morning. I'm a little under the weather; maybe later I'll come up with a better excuse.

"As some of you may have read I've been having trouble lately with homosexual-themes ocd. The worst pat of mine has been with these feelings of wanting to act on the gay thoughts and perform homosexual things. Someone on here reminded me that most of my thoughts seemed to be explicitly sexual in nature - never any thoughts of being romantic with men - well sure enough then I had the thought that perhaps I wanted to join a gay dating website and 'meet' a man to have a boy friend. It's ridiculous in that previously this has never crossed my mind (I'm 24) but now it feels like I really want to do this. I haven't, but it feels like I want to and when I imagine what it'd be like dating a man, it doesn't repulse me like I want it to.
I have various other feelings of wanting to do things, they are mostly sexual - like anonymously meet up for gay sex with somebody, that kinda thing. They always feel like I want to do them, they always feel totally real.
I just went to my GP and have an appt soon where hopefully I can get referred to the community mental health team. I am really struggling with all of this now. It feels really real, like I really want to do it. I have a girlfriend and feel utterly guilty and a total fraud to her. The funny thing is, I never look at a man in street and think """"""""I'd love a bit of that"""""""", whereas with women, I definitely do. I don't even want a boyfriend, it's so ridiculous yet I feel like I want to. That doesn't even make sense. Until the other day I'd never even thought about going on a gay dating site to look for a boyfriend, my fears just revolved around sexual themes.

"Hi all...hope you're doing OK.
I'm trying to summon up the courage to read one of the above books and wondered if anyone could reccomend which might be the best. Been putting it off cos I know as soon as I read stuff I'm gonna start worrying like crazy about not fitting into all the boxes neatly! Also, I still don't feel I know for sure if OCD is the diagnosis I've been given...well, one of them anyway. However, I've been feeling so much like pony poo that at least trying to do something like read a self-help book might at least help a little...I hope...
So, to my question, just wondered which book might be a good place to start? Most of my OCD type problems I think are more Pure O like, although I do do some things outwardly as well in a complusive way. But a lot of it is in my head, ruminating, analysing, worrying, what iffing, etc. One little thought can send my anxiety into the outer reaches of the galaxy and I have to then try and fix it, erase it, convince myself the opposite is true, etc, etc. I get really worried about things being just right...say in a relationship...and also am forever apologising and thinking things like, """"""""Oh, I wonder if x thought I meant such and such when I said that?"""""""" Then will often follow my ridiculous attempts to confirm and clarify! I also get really stressed about the truth. Even if I inadvertantly think I might be portraying something innacurate I often have to put it right. I think I've even told my hubby I've changed my clothes in the day before now cos otherwise he'll be under the mispprehension that I started out wearing what I'm wearing...and that would be untrue. Even as a child I used to say, """"""""I won't say I will and I won't say I won't, just in case I'm lying!"""""""" say for example if I was asked if I was going to the shops! :blushing: Some of my problems will involve needing to outwardly do things, like checking the grill's off or the handbrake's on...or the front door is shut...but one check, as long as I know I've really taken on board the check is enough. Other things might be needing to go back and read something I've passed and not read properly, eg a sign in a shop, even though it totally doesn't matter, or saying something to someone that really doesn't need to be said, for example about something I've just noticed, even though I feel silly saying it. I also get some counting rituals, (if rituals is the right word,) and touching things in the right way. But most of it does feel like it centres around thoughts and analysing and putting stuff right and needing way too mcuh reassurance for someone of my age!!
From what I've gleaned, Imp of the mind deals more with Pure O but I may have that wrong.

"Hi All,
For those of you who dont know me i have had Pure O for 29 Years, and up until last year when i had CBT, had no other therapy apart from regular medicine in the form of SSRI for the last 12 Years.
Ok so recently i had a a stress trigger and well fell back into my ocd rituals and traits and forgot everything i had learnt in my CBT sessions and was unable to recall anything i had learnt.
I wasnt through the will of trying but because i was so consumed with my mental ruminations, that i was unable to rationalise what was happening when i did so well after my CBT.
Ok to cut a long story short i came to the OCD Uk website and saw the book Break Free from OCD book advertised, so i bought a copy and it was the best thing i did.
The book itself in my opinion does very much relate to the physical effects of OCD more than from a Pure O and rumination perspective , and my particular fear Hocd but It is very informative not only for people that have had CBT, but will teach you CBT techniques, and some very valuable lessons you will or may have learned, in order you can reqonise what is happening and how to manage it and put in place coping methods and techniques.
If you have OCD of any type, i would really recommend this book as it will teach you how to break the cycle and how to reqonise what you need to do to help cure your OCD.

"Lots of people are struggling with this at the moment, so here is a collection of material I've put together from previous posts that may help everyone.
BREAKING THE ANXIETY CYCLE
Here are some more ideas to break the anxiety cycle.

Apply The Four Steps

Relabel the OCD thoughts and think around them and re-attribute and revalue.

Character Reference

Works well for self-worth, self-loathing issues in particular. Create, or revisit, a character reference of yourself as if drawn up by someone who knows you well. Looking at that, you will see the false impressions that the OCD is feeding on, and this can break the chain.

OCD Twin

A real favourite of mine and it really does work.Imagine how someone you know who does not have OCD would react to your intrusions, then seek to do the same.

Switch The Parts Of Your Brain

If the """"""""Lock"""""""" in your brain, the breakdown of the transmission that allows thoughts to pass through and away, is fuelling the vicious cycle, then try this one. It works!

if visuals are fuelling the OCD, switch your brain to thinking about words. If words is your problem, switch your attention to visuals. Here is how I do this. I have some classical music DVDs on and lose myself into the visual imagery, the setting, the costumes, the individual members of the orchestra - plus of course the wonderful music is a calmer.

I find that distressing thoughts lose their grip, the cycle can be broken and I get totally involved with the whole experience.

Deferrment

Note that your anxiety vicious cycle is maintaining distress. Say to yourself, if I stop thinking about these thoughts/images, I will break this cycle. Therefore I am going to defer this line of thinking until this evening (or whatever) and then I'll give it some more time.

(This method also is helpful with rituals, where you are deliberately opening up a gap to defer the carrying out of a ritual).

Set Projects

Accept that you are so caught up in your own problems, that you are damaging yourself. Think of someone else who is struggling (could be a fellow forum member) and commence a project to help them.

See if you can identify something that is fuelling your concerns, anxiety. There could be several different things.

Break each of these down into a project, open up a project file and state working out the best way to address the concerns thrown up by each project. Think of the various possible solutions which will help you, and trial them if need be, roll them out.

Rapid Eye Movement

Another favourite technique of mine , as I love the pop band REM. But only do this if you are in a very safe place and not carrying out any involved procedure like driving or operating machinery, you are just sitting down doing nothing else!.

This works on the basis that the mind can only focus on one thing at a time. So you concentrate on thinking the anxious thoughts, or the visual images. then you deliberately move your eyes rapidly from one side to the other. If it works for you, you can facilitate this by moving a finger from side to side in front of you and following the finger with your eyes.

As you concentrate on the eye movements, it will break the concentration on the thoughts/images. Follow htis up with a conscious effort to switch your thoughts/images to something else and get busy on a distraction theme.

Defusion Of Thoughts

There are many ways of carrying out other techniques like REM what will defuse thoughts. There is:

Creative Visualisation

In a safe environment e.g. in bed, sitting in a chair, close your eyes slow down your breathing and imagine a cloud hovering over your head . Imagine your unwanted thoughts/images - the ones causing the distress - to transfer into your breath and then with a little effort you """"""""puff"""""""" them out and they go into the cloud.

When the cloud has contained all your distressing thoughts/images, imagine the cloud slowly rising and gradually going out of sight, taking with it the thoughts and images you wish to discard.

Carry out with the slow relaxing breathing, and if it suits you, substitute an image of a beautiful scene and imagine yourself in that scene; if it suits you, make this scene your sanctuary and revisit it in times of stress.

You can use this method to visualise your bad thoughts written on blackboard, then see yourself rubbing them out. Or imagine the thoughts transferring onto a leaf which then floats way down a stream - it's a wonderful technique.

Metaphors

Struggling Uphill in Top Gear
Sometimes life can feel like we're struggling to drive or cycle up a long and steep hill, in top gear. The motor just can't get us there. It works really hard, but it's impossible to get up that steep hill in top gear. We need to change down a gear or two. Changing down gives the motor more torq, and is much better able to drive those wheels up that hill, albeit a bit slower.
It can be like that with life sometimes. We try to struggle on in top gear, expecting so much of ourselves, of others, of life itself. Sometimes we need to change down a gear. Slow it down, reduce the struggle. Carry on, but in a lower gear.

Negative Filter (only noticing the bad stuff),
Notice what’s happening – your thoughts, physical sensations, emotions, images, memories. Notice the way you’re interpreting what they mean, and how that’s affecting you.
Notice the unhelpful thoughts. It can help to say them differently, in a non-threatening way: slowly, in a squeaky or comic voice or write them down.
Try to see things differently. Metaphors can help us understand thoughts in a different way.
For example:
Passengers on the Bus
 You can be in the driving seat, whilst all passengers (thoughts) are noisily chattering, being critical or shouting out directions. You can allow them to shout, but you can keep your attention focused on the road ahead.

The Helicopter View
When something is distressing us, we’re so close to it, involved with it, part of it – it’s really hard to stand back from what’s happening. We see the close up view, but we can’t see anything else. It’s like the well-known saying: “We can’t see the wood for the trees”. If we could zoom out our view, like a helicopter hovering above, we’d be able to see the bigger picture. We could stand back, be less emotionally involved, and see a different perspective.
As you take a strong line with them, they calm down and so do your thoughts!


1). Disruption - deliberately bringing into cognitive thinking some absorbing and powerful alternative activity that demands extreme concentration.(such as writing a post in this forum).


2). Medication used in OCD can in some cases help restore the connections and ease the cycle or ease the effect of thoughts.

3).Another idea is that you imagine the thoughts leaving your head, going over the top of it, down your neck and trickling down you body and away.

Get Busy With Your Hobbies it will take you out of yourself, and you will be doing something you enjoy, as opposed to OCD which you don’t enjoy.

Stop Ruminating this is very damaging, so get busy on something useful and distracting whenever you find yourself doing this.

Keep Focused In The Present worrying about what’s happened in the past, or what may happen in the future, will make you ill anyway.

"I wanted to write this piece to help those who find difficulty in their dealings with others as a result of their OCD. 
Social anxiety is a  commonplace consequence. 
The illness seeks to impose rules and restrictions upon us - layers upon our OCD """"""""onion"""""""",  marginalising us - making us withdraw within ourselves. 
But it doesn't have to be that way. 
This is not a topic primarily intended to get us started on the road to recovery through cognitive behavioural therapy - I and others have written many on that subject, which is  the way forward in treatment of OCD. 
I am writing this simply to show us that we don't have to accept the social restrictions of OCD. 
In therapy I came across - I think it was in a self-help book - the phrase """""""" we are not bad, and we never were """""""".
Now of course we can't take that literally; everyone does things which can be seen to be bad. 
The meaning here is that OCD tells us we are bad because of an OCD issue, which is not factual or very much exaggerated. 
It might tell us we are have been or could be :
A paedophile
Have a false sexual preference 
That we are unfaithful
Can commit harm by some specified theme 
Are bad 
Should be punished 
And many others of this ilk. 
Result, we shy away from others - even though the real us desperately might want the opposite to be the case. 
I remember when I was a youngster living in Rugby - close by where I live now in the Midlands - it was a common belief amongst young men that the place to go to get a girl was Nottingham - where there were more girls than boys. 
Whether numerically this might have been factually true doesn't matter. 
The place to find a romantic partner is wherever we are. 
We shouldn't feel stigmatised by our OCD. And if we feel we need to explain it to others, there is  excellent material on the main OCD-UK website to help us to do this. 
Will potential partners shy away from us because of our OCD?  
OCD would have it so - it wants to minimise and restrict us, believe its lies and exaggerations. 
I have personally met a number of partners who devote energy to helping their other halves on the road to recovery. They have taken time to learn about OCD, how it affects their partner, and how they can support and help them. 
There are numerous such persons out there. 
So, let's get help with our OCD, certainly, but meanwhile understand we do not have to feel a social stigma.
And a partner is out there for us,we can comfortably be with and interact with others. 
We don't have to let our OCD marginalise us.

"My theme is the horrible pedophile one.
I need some help with the above CBT technique.
I was out tonight at a gig, lots of people were dancing in the aisle. I spotted a child and felt panic. Then I thought, so if I was dancing over there, what is it I'm scared of? So I made myself think of my worst fear in my head...'maybe I am going to...maybe not. Maybe I am a pedo...maybe not'.
Is that what you would say to yourself in bringing on the feared thought?
Then just ignore it, ignore the anxiety and dance and enjoy my evening and not allow myself to ruminate post situation?
Is that the correct tactic to call OCD's bluff. It seems so scary. I'm worrying that I've even imagined this exposure scenario, God knows what my anxiety would be like if I had actually thought that thought in that situation. As oppose to from a distance.

"Hi guys.
Things have taken a turn for the worse when in a cleaning frenzy, I cleaned my laptop one too many times and it's broken. It's not even 12 months old and it's completely unusable. On the same day, my mobile broke, also due to water damage. That's also not 12 months old. On the same day, the remote for the TV broke. Due to water damage. Saintly fiance came home from work to discover these breakages, and somehow, goodness knows how, managed to hold his temper and even managed to console me during a meltdown. I didn't learn though did I? In excess of 600 quids worth of kit wrecked and I move on to clean his PC. And my very old, already broken but usable mobile phone. My phone, once again, stopped working. I took the battery out and then in again and the thing hissed out a load of smoke and burnt my fingers. So I'm onto my fiance's old very broken phone. Which I have cleaned. But I've only used antibac wipes, not spray. :dry:
So. The doctor considers my case non-emergency. My arms are peeling from chemical burns, my hands are cut, my house is ruined, my clothes are covered in bleach spots, the carpet is covered in bleach spots, our hot water bill is through the roof, I'm virtually unable to leave the house because I know I will need a shower when I return, and still...my case has been placed on another waiting list. After a history of severe mental health problems, you'd think someone in the chain would take a look and say 'gee, maybe we should get round to helping this girl before she kills herself in a house fire or by inhaling too much disinfectant?'

"Hi. I am new to this forum. I have been suffering with ocd and depression for 6 years now as a result of the bullying I went through in school. A particular incident that occured in school is what effects me. I was friends with a boy called robert for quite a while. After a while he began to bully me, saying he would hit me, was namecalling and humiliating me infront of people. I was a nervous wreck and lost a lot of love for myself. I began to not be friends with him and started spending time with other people as he wanted nothing to do with me. This leads to the incident I was talking about. One lunchtime when everyone was aloud out of school I went to a shop with one of my other friends. We bumped into robert and a mutual friend unintentially in the shop. All of a sudden 3 other boys that I didnt know came into the shop and wanted to start a fight with robert. They were with one of roberts friends who wanted to protect robert. Me and my friend that I was with left the shop and area. This wasnt because I was scared but more because I thought I should have nothing to do with it and since he bullied me didnt care what happened to him or what he did. We left the area and went to a computer room in the school to do our work. I felt an enormous amount of guilt come over me and wanted to go back to the area. Nothing ended up happening and not long after robert came into the computer room with one of hes friends. We went outside to a big crowd and hes friend was saying he was going to spit on me and punch me. I was always a quiet kid and would never defend myself. They didnt in the end and the situation ended.
Since then I have dealt with severe depression and ocd and have be to a lot of councelling. I am currently going to councelling but am stikl struggling. I feel I dese3ve to suffer because I left someone to get beat up. I am not able to move forward in life and am crippling myself with these thoughts. I have suffered so much from these thoughts. My ocd is bad at the moment and I feel I have to keep performing rituals to I get things right. I think to myself that god would see leaving someone to get beat up as a bad thing. This is the main thought and source that cripples me and gets me down. This is the thought I need to get through and over to move forward. If anyone has anything to say, any advice or any opinions they would be much appreiciated. Thanks for the help and reading and all the best to anyone in suffering.

"I've been burgled and feel sick. Just could do with a bit of reassurance if anyone can give it.
They've come in the house in broad daylight, 2 cars on the drive as we were on our bikes, nicked the laptop, a mobile, my purse and one of the cars.
However, they've caught them and got the car. Someone had seen 3 kids trying to put a laptop up their tops, called the police who got them and found keys on them. They went round looking at all the cars of that type trying the keys and found it. They came to us before we'd even had chance to report it.
Anyway, they've been charged - 2 of them released. I just feel sick about it. Part of you wants your revenge, part wants to stay in the house, part just thinks to forget it. We know who they are an I am full of rage and bad nerves at the same time.
Needless to say, the ocd trying it's hardest. I keep thinking it's because I haven't been doing the rituals and I know I have to convince myself they have nothing to do with it. But it is soooooooooooooo hard.
I could just do with a tiny bit more convincing, please.

"I have been having some buzzing/tingling feelings in my feet for a while now, and at first I thought it was my semi-recent medication I was taking that was causing it, but now im not so sure.
This all started before my POCD, btw, I had started a new medication and after a few weeks I noticed my feet/toes getting tingly, I talked to my doctor and I switched back to my old medication that I was taking, after not taking anything for about a week. The tingling caused me a lot of anxiety, but while I had stopped taking the medication I relaxed because I expected the problem to get better, which it did. So my symptoms had greatly improved, but THEN my POCD started, which caused absolutely massive anxiety in me, and after a short while I noticed that the tingling sensation in my feet had come back, affecting both feet instead of favoring one like it had before, and this time it seemed a little bit more buzzy, but I never thought that it could be connected to my anxiety. After recent google searching though, I saw that this could be caused by anxiety, and it kinda makes me wonder if it's my ocd that's causing it. Since I have really started to worry about the buzzing, my POCD has been better, really really significantly better, although still there. But now I find myself checking the veins on my feet all the time looking for blood clots or something when I get the feeling in my feet. I can't be sure if it stays or goes away when im not paying attention to it, but for the most part if I keep myself busy with something I wont notice it.
I'm not really sure if all what I just wrote makes much sense at all, but basically what I'm trying to ask is if anyone has experienced something similar to this? I don't know if it's my ocd, or an actual problem. It seems like it could be my ocd switching themes to health anxiety (although maybe it started at health anxiety first I'm realizing), because of how good my POCD has been recently, but I just don't know =(.
I will be going to see my doctor (that I go to for non-ocd related issues) soon and I plan on bringing this up with him, as well as informing him that I believe I may have OCD (although I probably won't be telling him the nature of my POCD).","['checking', 'itching', 'Thought', 'Medication', 'anxiety', 'anxiety', 'OCD', 'symptom']","['theme', 'sensation']","['anxiety', 'sensation', 'OCD', 'checking', 'Thought', 'symptom', 'theme', 'Medication', 'itching']",1.0,,1,0,
"Today i went to a belly dancing event,where i knew id see my old dance teacher,who was horrible to me just before xmas and asked me to leave her class,as i didnt like her bullying me in class,and commented to another class member on myspace,who told me teacher! I hate her shes a bitch.Anyway,i knew that her and my old class members would be there today,so i felt very nervous about going,as i thought they would be nasty to me,as thats how they used to be to me.But i went,and did run into my old teacher,who was actually friendly,but evil friendly not genuinely friendly.Anyway,i got through that anxiety.And had a nice day helping out my new dance teacher and having my photo taken with some camels! i focussed on my new teacher and class members who were there,and tried to ignore my old teacher.I had my mum with me which helped,as she knows all about how horrible my old teacher was to me,and kept warning me when she was approaching,as it was all in a school hall,stalls etc selling dance gear.We stayed to watch a dance demonstration,which i enjoyed,and although i saw a few old class members,one was friendly with me.But then a made a fatal mistake..i had a can of coke.Im not used to caffeine as i dont have it normally except occassionalyl in chocolate.I went really jittery and high,and not in a nice way,i felt faint and horrible with my anxiety.I got home about an hour later,and although i felt like the caffeine had worn off by then,and i was thinking how great it was my ocd hadnt spiked,i then spiked while sitting at my mums house about my friend.
An intrusive thought popped back into my head saying that if my male friend kissed me i would kiss him back,and for some reason i focussed on down there,and got this twinge and erotic like feeling,while then also straight after wanting to throw up with anxiety.it made me feel so horrible as id never want to do that,the thought is horrible for me.Although the thought itself didnt give me any positive emotions.It made me feel so terrible,i was nearly shaking with anxiety.The reaction in my groin really scared me and i wanted to be sick.Although i was also watching the tv at the time and doing other things,so dont know if it was the thought that directly caused the reaction.I hate to reassure myself but if i dont ill go mad.
i just dont get why i would feel an erotic like feeling down there from a thought that i hated so much and would never want to do.i should add i was also watching a funny programme at the time.could someone answer me on this? i mean,i know it must be ocd,but why would it start to feel like that now? i still feel sick....i mean,ive had groinal responses before but this one felt more real,and was different to the others.And yet i didnt find the thought at all appealing.

"Hello,
I went for my initial assessment at Camhs and told them pretty much everything about my OCD including the really hard bits like the false memories because i was told it was all confidential and i didn't want my parents knowing about it all, and the Camhs people said, 'nothing you say in here will be passed onto your parents unless you ask us to. All your parents have to know is that you're seeing us'. That was a couple of months ago. Now my parents have just received a letter from the Camhs consultant listing absolutely everything i told them, including everything about suicidal thoughts of hanging myself and everything and i don't know what to do. Up to now I've just told my parents i have a few OCD rituals and obsessive thoughts. Has this happened to anyone else?

"Hello everyone, I am new on here.
My 18 year old daughter suffers from severe OCD/BDD and i am trying to find a specialist in the Manchester area, or anywhere really, to see her. she has had no real help from the nhs, who seem to be totally unaware how to treat severe OCD. currently they want to admit her to a psychiatric ward at a local unit, but she is refusing to go as she (and I) dont think it will be particularly helpful as no-one there specialises in these conditions.
so i may have to look further afield and go private - any suggestions will be much appreciated. It is very urgent as she now cannot drink due to rituals, sleep or do much at all. the other day she was stuck standing in one position in her bedroom for 6 hours, without being able to move at all.

"hi everybody. my name is craig. i am new to this forum. i am 20 years old and have suffered from OCD for 2 years. my OCD can often stop me from doing certain things, for example, going on holidays - this is because i need to be at home to do my rituals.
i have several rituals that make it dificult for me leaving and returning to the house. my rituals involve me being outside (no matter what the weather is like) i need to be on my drive outside my house in order to complete my rituals. my rituals involve me swallowing a lot.
i go to the edging of my drive and cross it, i then come back onto the drive and my feet has to be on the drive. i put my feet on their sides so that i am standing awkwardly and then i have to swallow. after i have swallowed i cant think of the numbers 3 and 9. if i do then i have to start all over again.
i can be trying to get this ritual right for upto 4 hours at its worst but usually it is between 1-2 hours, i do this nearly every night apart from when i try to fight it but it is very hard to try to stay indoors. i avoid going to the shops or going out anywhere because it is too tempting for me. often i cant resist and just have to go outside.

"I know others suffer from this, and it's started to become a big problem for me. I am just wondering if people have some bright ideas on how to tackle this, or does medication help with this?
Free associations work on the basis that an idea pops into your head, and you write down a neural association, then another one and so on - if they are logical but inert and not troublesome that is a sign of calm mental health.
What is happening for me currently is the opposite of this. MY brain is making negative connections to distress from an OCD theme and invoking the anxiety response. It can do this incredibly quickly, and before I know it I have negative words or images that are very distressing in my cognitive thinking, and mounting anxiety..

"Hi, iv never been to any of these sorts of forums before but i do not know where else to turn, i need help from other people. I have had the same thoughts for a year now, i perform the same rituals every day at the same time, in the same way, and if i do not do them i get really panicky and then have to perform them for twice as long. My worries revolve around my phobia of being sick, it all started a year ago when i wasn't very well, and ever since then i am convinced that i will be ill again.I find it hard to even speak about it, because i am scared it will punish me by making me sick. There are so many things i cant do, i wont drink any amounts of alcohol because i fear it will make me sick and as a result i will not let my partner drink alcohol because i am scared it will make him sick and then it will make me feel sick. I have a fear of wearing new pyjamas as i think it will make me sick. I also perform rituals in my head, i have to say things in my head a certain amount of times while rubbing certin objects. Its like when you say something but you dont want it to happen you say 'oh touch wood' then touch some, well thats what i have to do, I have to say all of these things in my head whilst rubbing wood, and i have to do it on different objects before i can go to sleep. My rituals only really happen at night time, i perform them before i go to bed. I have to sleep with certain objects around me and they have to be in a particular place, i can't sleep if i do not have them, i also have to sleep with a light on so that i can see these objects. I am also scared that food will make me sick, so i have to cook everything for longer than it says to just to be careful. It has really started to affect my social life as i am at university and i cannot go out with friends, i cannot even go out even if i do not drink. I also find it hard being with lots of people in a small space as i am scared i will catch something off of them. If ever a friend is ill i will stay well clear but i am then convinced that i will catch what they had even if i haven't been around them. I know that i have a problem, however i am not sure whether it is severe enough to go to the doctor about. I am registered with the doctors on my university campus but i feel they will not know about it and will just send me away, i feel like i'm mad and he will think of me as a loony.

"Hello, I wanted to ask the community a question. I've been dealing a lot better in terms of anxiety and depression. But, I've ran into a problem. My 'OCD' surrounds the theme of sexual orientation. Before this hit two and a half years ago, I felt comfortable in my sexuality. I was still young but I just felt like I knew, you know.

I have just turned 18 within the past couple of months so I know I am still young (that makes me uncomfortable). I feel as thought that my love for men was just a lie. Even thinking about a relationship gives me anxiety. I no longer have an certainty of who I am attracted to. I feel as thought this 'theme' has cleared and I don't know what my sexuality is.

It is hard for me to explain why I do my rituals and what exactly they are. I do wash my hands a lot, but not because I am afraid of germs. I seem to be afraid of certain things I touch having bad consequences attached to them, as a result there are many things that I own or just that are around me that I will not touch because I am """"""""afraid"""""""" of them for lack of a better word. My room is like an obstacle course as I try to jump over bags and clothes that I am trying to stay away from.
Besides being afraid to touch certain things I also have some pure O. If I think a bad intrusive thought and I am doing an action, say washing my hands, I have to repeat that action while thinking a good thought. Sometimes I repeat actions so many times that it completely consumes my entire day.
I left the semester early to try and get help to control my OCD. For a very long time I have hid my condition from my family and friends, now that I have told them they have been very supportive. Currently I am feeling defeated, my OCD is hitting me and won't stop.

"Hello,
Long time OCD sufferer. I've used the forum before, so hoping I can stick around and help out. I've made huge progress in recent years but there is one theme that I can never really shake for good. 
I had a huge breakdown almost a couple of years ago from it and now we are in winter, and in a period where we are supposed to feel festive and happy, I'm starting to get those old feeling again. 
It's centred around free will. Do we have it? Or is it an illusion?
Modern day physics would tell us we don't. The idea we are in control and 'thinking' our thoughts is, according to physics, an illusion. 
I find it crushingly depressing. In the past I spent month after month searching for counter arguments to disprove it. In the end, I hit rock bottom and it took a monumental effort to get back to relative normal. But it lingers. I'm getting the urge to search again. I'm trying to resist, but it is hard. 
Fact is, I don't really know either way. I just know if it is true, life loses a lot of its meaning and I think that us not being in control is quite scary. 
There's a lot more to it, but I don't want this to turn into an essay. I'm just really struggling at the moment. Every time I have a thought, I can see it comes out of nowhere, and it freaks me out. 
Thank you.

"To be honest, right now, I'm feeling extremely defeated. My ocd is really not good. The obsessive nature of my sexually themed thoughts has completely gotten out of control. I have deprived myself of arousal for like a year and a half. No masturbation or anything, every time I feel myself get aroused I test myself with the thoughts, to make sure I don't like them. It's just... It's been so long now that I feel like I've broken my mind, as if I will just never get better. I've made leaps and bounds from where I was last year, but I'm still refusing arousal and I'm still obsessing over the same thoughts/feelings. I want to persevere, I want to know there is hope.

"I think I may already know the answer to this but can ocd actually convince you about doing something wrong or the thoughts being true rather than just worrying if they are? If at times during big ocd spikes you’ve thought the thoughts are probably true does it go beyond ocd? I’ve also convinced myself of doing some awful things not just thoughts and now I’m not as convinced I did anything but that’s maybe different than believing the thoughts could be true at times? For example I once convinced myself I sexually assaulted someone and was somewhat suicidal and thinking how to punish myself until after confessing to multiple people who said I didn’t do anything I started feeling a bit better and eventually thinking I probably didn’t do anything wrong. Or like some of my other posts on here and thinking I’m sick. 
  Some people are able to say deep down I know it’s ocd and then others like me can’t say that. I can say deep down I know I have ocd to an extent at least, due to noticing how my brain works and obvious things like hand washing. But not with certainty that it’s not also more. Why is that?

"Things were going really well, my girlfriend was over staying with me for nearly the last two months and everything was ace. Anyway, a new guy started at work and after about a week of working with him, for some reason when I looked at him I got this feeling/thought that I was attracted to him, specifically his mouth, and now it feels like I actually am. Specifically just his mouth, but it's enough to convince me that I have a crush on him, it feels like I really am attracted to it/him and it's making me feel awful.
My girlfriend lives in the States and is due to be coming over here to study after the Summer and us get a place together, now I feel like I can't do that because actually I'm gay. I feel horrendously guilty whenever I speak to her because now I'm convinced that I'm actually gay and that I fancy this guy at work. I'm sure that the first few times I met him I didn't feel anything like this, but now I do. I guess I am checking to see if I find him attractive whenever I look at him, hoping I don't but even so I always do.
I've had 'spikes' in the past where I was convinced I fancied my mates, but I always managed to let them go and after a while they didn't feel real - but this time I'm convinced it's different and it's real. I really don't know what I should do - I love my girlfriend and want to be with her, I was so looking forward to us living together and the future and now this has happened, and I'm convinced I'm gay, that I should split up with her and that I have no future with her. Like I say, whenever I look at him I actually feel like I'm attracted to him, specifically his mouth. It feels identical to a 'crush'. It's horrible. I'm sure I could accept it if this was the norm for me, but I'm convinced that at 25, this is the first time I've ever truly felt like this, or that's what it feels like. What scares me even more is that I've never been one to define sexuality in strict black and white terms, so I feel like there's a possibility that this cuold be real. All I know is that it makes me feel supremely anxious and uncomfortable, and these feelings are definitely unwanted. I can't say why though - I guess I just don't like them for whatever reason. I don't want to be gay, I want to enjoy a future and relationship with my girlfriend, but how can I if I fancy a man?
I don't have any sexual desires towards men, never fantasise about them or anything else, nor have I ever had a gay experience. And I have had spikes about fancying friends before, but this time I'm convinced it's real and different and honestly can't see how I can get past it. Every time I look at him I feel like I'm attracted to him, and it's really threatening my relationship with my girlfriend. It's already stressful enough her going back to NY after being here for nearly 2 months, without me knowing when I'll next see her and having to communicate over Skype. Now she's applying for uni over here I feel terrible because I'm convinced I'm gay and eventually I'm going to have to break up with her, after she's moved thousands of miles for me. It makes me feel so nervous. I just wish this guy had never even started here. I honestly cannot see that this is ocd, and if it isn't then what? Then I must be at least bisexual, if not gay. That definitely compromises my relationship, to me. I've tried to use the 4 steps method and treat this stuff as ocd, but it doesn't seem to work. It doesn't go away. Admittedly I was checking constantly the other day in a meeting by looking at him to see if I still felt this feeling, and I did, and it seemed to get a lot worse that day.

"I've had ocd for over 10 years. It got so much worse about 4/5 years ago. I lived away from home for a year where it only got back when I came home due to being so busy at uni on my course that I barely had ocd cross my mind until I visited home where it went mad. I was very unhappy at uni and was crying nearly everyday due to my course. Finished uni, moved back home then my ocd spiked due to something ( thought someone I loved was doing weed, turns out they weren't) then I just seemed to get very depressed. My ocd lessened but I still felt depressed. I then started getting angry at little things .... People yawning, biting names, whistling, singing, ... Stupid I know. I then got better and didn't feel as bad apart from on y period and I still am bad on my period and all time small things irritate me bad!
Today I just got so sad for no reason and felt like no energy, no motivation and like what is the point in my life, i want to die.
I won't do anything don't worry I can't due to guilt of leaving loved ones behind and ruining their life.

"I realised that I am not so depressed anymore, nor is my anxiety as bad BUT I still get thoughts when Im in a certain situation (around knives, alone with someone or sleeping with someone) and I get that weird urged feeling that i hate and so afraid of, but now that I think about it its probably the anxiety and the over analysing cause its the same type of feeling when Im nervous for something or Im scared about something. Again, Ive gotten weird thoughts like everyone else, every so often prior to this, but never EVER to this extent where I got that weird urged sensation (which is obviously controllable) so this is how I know that this is probably the OCD.
My question is, is this called a """"""""spike"""""""" where my thoughts arent as bad, Im not nearly as depressed and Im not having constant anxiety throughout the day? Only sometimes? Im nervous that I am not depressed anymore along with the thoughts Again, my anxiety is not nearly as bad but I know its still there when Im in a certain situartion..
I thought id be happy as Im not depressed anymore nor am I having constant thoughts throughout the day like I was. Ofcourse Im not completely over them as I still am not completely assured that these are """"""""just thoughts, not me"""""""" and I am still scared to be around someone alone. I think Im scared for that as I constantly avoid it so Im never exposing myself to it which is pro longing the process, and this is the same thing about sleeping with someone, I still have yet to sleep with someone, and I know I should start so that slowly but surley it gets easier.

"Hello everyone,
I’m struggling. Please can someone just give me a reason why I should be allowed to move on and forgive myself for the things I feel I have done wrong? I don't think it would be fair to move forward so I would really appreciate some sort of argument of why I should be allowed to forget, and then I can try refocusing. I feel I have done wrong and I think I made my dog scared and gave her a bad life for almost 18 years (by too much smacking and therefore she became v. submissive, and a serious lack of regular walks). Some people may agree and some people may not. I have told myself I should forgive myself as I have felt guilty and punished myself for it. However, this issue has been a subject of rumination and guilt on and off since she died (she died in 2007 but other ocd topics took over until about a year and a half ago when the dog issue became the main topic). I don’t feel my year and a half of upset compensates for her 17 and a half years of a crappy life. I don’t want to, but I feel I should suffer for longer. Plus I ruined her only chance at life, shouldn’t I be punished for that as well? It seems sensible that I should be punished as our society agrees that if you commit the crime then you should do the time. I think if my dog was actually a child, everyone would agree that I should feel bad and I should be punished. Yes I was a child/teen, when I smacked her (even though she never had regular walks up until her death, when I was an adult and ols enough to take on responsibility)but that doesn't change the life she had.

"If I can briefly explain my situation, I am about 5 sessions into CBT and alongside my long standing issues of if I am attracted to children and a couple of other things is OCD around my relationship.
In a nutshell I have a crush on someone at work and it's been causing me varying degrees of distress over the last few months. It has got so bad that we have decided to look at my thinking around the situation. My core concern is if I still want to be with my wife or this other person. We have realised I have been ruminating on this issue for hours a day and I am getting very distressed and drained.  I was under the impression that a little bit of ruminating about this person was enjoyable to me but as time went on it became distressing and caused me a lot of anxiety. However when we actually drew on a white board the process I am going through it seemed to me that it is actually not really enjoyable at all and I quickly become anxious. We realised I was doing the following
- trying to avoid this person such as taking short cuts or certainly not the usual walkways  through the warehouse I work in to minimise walking past her office / bumping in to her.
-Planning what to say, i.e thinking of conversation starters should our paths cross. I don't really do this with anyone else.
- Reflecting back on conversations I do have with her such as if I was 'entertaining' enough or witty enough etc. I think this is not helped by the fact that other men in the warehouse seem more at ease chatting to her and are a lot more relaxed and informal around her. I feel our conversations are uptight by comparison.
-I go off at tangents in my head about her life outside work and if she likes her boyfriend , what she does in her spare time etc.
-Feeling guilty about the situation, wanting to confess to my wife especially if I make a 'joke' to her and she does laugh, was I being too friendly and would my wife approve etc.
My therapist came up with my homework which was to use a tally chart to notice each time I start engaging in rumination for any longer than 2 mins about this subject and try and catch myself doing it and then stop. The overall goal to see how my Guilt, anxiety etc is effected by my not ruminating so much about it.
This has been going ok but I came a bit unstuck yesterday and got into a massive rumination over it. and today has not been great as well. What confused me when I talked to my therapist was that she suggested coming up with a technique in my head to raise me awareness of ruminating, almost like a visual stop sign in my mind. When I suggested I use my usual it's just an OCD thought that I use for my other issues she seemed to not think I should use this on this issue. Can anyone suggest to me why she told me this? it's confused and worried me and I have been ruminating over that too. maybe she thinks that I don't maybe love my wife and deep down do want to be with this person after all? I would appreciate another view on this please as I feel I am getting too bogged down in it all.  Thank you.
By the way there is no suggestion that this person wants to be with me in that way, I think she likes me but not in that way, she is hard to read as she is quite friendly to a lot of people. . I do find on there rare occasions this issue is not at the forefront on my mind I am a bit calmer and it does cause me distress the thought of leaving my wife as I value our relationship.

I can't believe I am here again. Sorry if that sounds awful but I am sure you will all agree that you'd rather not be here. I was diagnosed with OCD in 2009 and I was on this forum back in 2009/2010. I had an awful time and I was pretty poorly, split up with my boyfriend and life was bad! 
In March 2010 I started talking to my now boyfriend and I have to say I am the luckiest girl, he is amazing. He knows everything and I have been with him ever since. He's the one!! 
Ive always had aneixty but since being with my boyfriend I can't say I've had a really bad episode of OCD......until now.
My OCD themes have always been sexual/violent and I've always obsessed on mistakes from my past and also the uncertainty of the future. Even now im trying to link a pattern and im convinced that it's all going to happen again and im going to lose my boyfriend, life and job....just like before. I'm even seeking confirmation by researching my Dream meanings to see if it says """"""""bad things are coming for the future"""""""" (I cringe when I read this). 
I feel the same patterns and this horrible urge to confess like I did before but I'm really trying to resist because I know confessing all my mistakes no matter how big or small, will not make me feel better! I'm really trying to take what I know and put it in to practise, so I guess that's a start I just hate feeling like a liar! 
I guess im really just looking for support and some guidance on what to do. This time around I don't feel as crazy because I know it's OCD but I can't deny feeling awful. I can't seem to let go from my mistakes in the past even though I know I'm a good person! My OCD has clung to every sexual/weird experience/confused hormones from growing op (well over 10 years ago) and somehow is making me feel like a false horrible person! 
I also can't get past the uncertainty of the future and im worried that I'll lose my bf just like I did before, im worried history is repeating itself. 
I took myself of my meds and I've been off them for about 6 years but I'm wondering if I should go back on them before it gets out of control. 
is resisting the urge to confess a good thing? Have I actually learnt something??

"Hi everyone.
I'm a 30 year old man and I have OCD that is taking over my life.
I can remember having OCD even when I was a very young kid as young as 7 years old.
I've had the OCD in many different ways but the type of OCD I have right now is by far the worst.
I think it is called pure O.
First of all, please let me just assure everyone that the thoughts I'm about to talk about are making me miserable. I do not want these thoughts and the more I try to ignore the thoughts, the more they bother me.
Any time I see something upsetting or disturbing on the telly/on the news/ etc, straight away my thoughts turn to my children.
When I'm with my children, disturbing thoughts bother me. I can't even look at my children whilst these thoughts are bothering me.
When people talk about something that I find upsetting, I have to make out I've got to go to the toilet. I then spend ages in the toilet trying to clear my mind of these upsetting things before I can carry on. If I just ignore the thoughts, its kind of like my mind stores the thought, ready to be cleared from my mind later on.
These 'rituals' are basically me putting imaginary barriers up in my mind that make me feel like I'm keeping the upsetting thoughts away from everything else.
I can be going through these rituals for half and hour some times and people are starting to notice.
The thing is, I know upsetting/disturbing things on the telly or in the news or in conversations are a part of life. For example, Everyone else seems to be able to go from a conversation about something awful to then change to another conversation talking about their children and it doesn't bother them atall. They know that the 2 conversations are seperate and thats something I find difficult.
One of the worst things about all of this is that it stops me from having a normal life.
Supposing I'm signing up for a new ebay account. If something upsetting bothers me whilst signing up, then that's it. I can never use that ebay account without the thought bothering me.
If I go and buy some clothes, I try not to have any upsetting thoughts whilst I try them on or pay for them otherwise I won't want to wear them. I've actually taken clothes back before for this reason.
When I wake up, if the first thought I have is something upsetting then I feel like the whole day is spoilt.
I go to church quite a lot and I feel like I'm getting further from God. I keep praying to get better and make all kinds of promises to ignore the OCD thoughts and to just blank them out but I always end up falling apart.
Simple tasks such as sending an email at work can take hours because of the OCD.
I just don't know what to do. I try to ignore the ocd and I will be fine but then all of a sudden, something really vivid will bother me and I just fall apart. It feels like I can only beat the OCD when it lets me but it can just knock me down at will.
I've tried CBT before. I spent a fortune on it and it didnt work for me. Ive tried medication also and it made me feel worse.
I've beaten other types of OCD before on my own so I've got to try and be strong.
My life is becoming a misery and if anyone has any advice I will be so thankful.","['talking', 'email', 'Medication', 'toilet', 'Rituals', 'fall', 'OCD', 'Thought']",[],"['talking', 'email', 'fall', 'Thought', 'Rituals', 'toilet', 'Medication', 'OCD']",,1.0,,,

I'm not sure if it's in spite of this or because of it, but I find it almost impossible to keep my house clean or tidy.I hate the state of my house and think that I am very lazy to have let it get so out of hand. I feel overwhelmed and unable to tackle it. I procrastinate a lot and I'm very disorganised. I find quite small cleaning tasks take me a long time to complete, I use too much of cleaning product, find it difficult to know if things are really clean in terms of germs, get anxious about touching things that are dirty and have to keep washing my hands. Getting anything much done is very slow and I think I started avoiding and putting off doing things to the point that it all became too much. 
We never have anyone round and I hate the way our house is. 
 Can anyone relate to this?

"Hiya,
I really dont know where to start. I feel such a mess i am depressed very anxious and at the point where i dont want to live again i can't stick this life anymore a life of mental health problems.
When i look back to how i was this time last year i can see that i am a lot worse now. I think each year just gets worse and worse my OCD just seems to progress despite help from various mental health professionals including CBT and help from some medication.
I feel maybe i am beyond help that i have no choice but 2 live with this intense OCD. I feel Carolyn has disappeared and however much i hate livin like this it has now got 2 the point where it is so bad that i will never beable 2 try and change it i am too sucked in the same my eatin disorder its been 9 years now battlin wiv Anorexia and Bulimia and 15 years with OCD and i have lost count of how many years i have been battling with depression.
I had to look after my daughter on my own this mornin something i rarely do on my own as my partner works from home but today he had to go to Cardiff and i have been dreading this day so much because i knew OCD would torture me being alone with a 9 month old baby who i obviously love more than words can describe is a time when my anxiety levels get seriously high.
Anyway i got through it but the thoughts anxiety were unbearable i am now left feelin so depressed so angry so frustrated so scared because i hate this life i want 2 beable 2 look after Sophie on my own with out fear. There is nothin i do that is not related to OCD there is not one single second of the day when i am not doin mind rituals obsessin or doin rituals it is really startin 2 hit me hard.
OCD has seriously got me and it is only getting worse. I am scared of how i am going to end up.
Carolyn

"Hi guys I'm struggling so badly lately. I have severe off where it is extremely common for my days to be filled with rituals etc (you guys know) but I was doing so well for a few months and the past 2 months it's crept up more often and especially this month it's gotten bad again. Finding it harder to ignore thoughts, spending more time doing rituals and now, I'm not sure if it's ocd but I'm guessing it is, I'm totally put off food. The littlest of thing will put me off or I will be hungry and want to eat but can't because I feel I shouldn't or I'll get a thought and I therefore can't eat the food. It just isn't appealing to me right now which is obvious to people as I'm not eating much and losing weight. I'm exhausted my this disease. Currently in tears and just don't know what to do I'm a 21 year old outgoing girl and am so exhausted physically and emotionally of dealing with this. I'm off meds just now because they weren't helping and haven't had CBT in a few months. Even when I do CBT and on meds there isn't much difference. But not being able to eat is really taking its tole as I am a student and also work long shifts that are constantly on the go, it's just making me even more tired and stuff not eating. Anyone have any advice please? How can I ignore these thoughts I can't do it anymore","['OCD', 'disease', 'Rituals', 'Food', 'Thought']",[],"['disease', 'Thought', 'Rituals', 'Food', 'OCD']",,1.0,,,
I feel like im going mad. Im always posting on here but seem no one can relate. I have been diagnosed with ocd and depression and anxiety i had all sorts of horrible thoughts and doing rituals (these are not as bad as the obsessive thoughts)me and my partner have been trying for a baby for 5 months now but since i have took bad my partner and i decided that we should leave it a while till i get a bit better i have seen the doctor he has put me on meds and i have spoken to the counsellor at my surgery who is arranging me to see a CBT therapist. She even recommended not trying for a while because the baby could pick up on things in the womb especially as im not looking after myself properly this makes me upset as people look at me as though i cant look after a baby. At the moment all my friends (well most) now have babys and i accepted that i needed to get help but some days i wake up and i start obssessing that i want a baby now and because we have been trying its was hard to suddenly stop im in turmoil i even had to quit my uni degree as everthing got on top of me. I hate myself at times i sometimes can think rationally and agree that i need some help first but my other biggest worry is that my partner may not then want one when ive had some help which he has assured me he would never do but i feel he thinks im not fit to have a baby. Everything is a waiting game with this illness the medication the help im even scared to go out the house now as i get upset when i see new moms with their babies and feel like i may break down. I also get anxious and have panic attacks then obsessing im having a breakdown. As i have said on previous posts my thoughts change daily is this normal for OCD? Does it ever get any better? i just dont want to get out of bed at the moment just want to sleep but then my mind never stops thinking my partner works long hours and he comes home and i take it out on him he is really supportive but i feel so guilty for doing this to him but sometimes i just want to run away from everyone as i feel everyone looks at me as a mental case. My mom has told most the family which i know they are supportive but feel as though they are just seeing me as a nut job as i has a bad bout of depression 7 years ago where i took an overdose and all of a sudden its come back also along being diagnosed with OCD my partner just keeps saying keep positive you will get better but i feel like screaming at him sometimes as it does not seem to be getting any better at the moment and he does not understand how i feel.,"['anxiety', 'anxiety', 'Rituals', 'urge', 'Medication', 'guilt', 'depression', 'OCD', 'Thought']",['obsessive'],"['urge', 'anxiety', 'obsessive', 'depression', 'Thought', 'Rituals', 'Medication', 'OCD', 'guilt']",,1.0,,,
"It's kind of like a constant swirl of like bad thoughts, followed by doubt if they are bad thoughts. Never ending confusion. It almost feels like I have two OCD's that battle against each other to see which one i'll listen to. And by listening to one, I go against the other, and vice versa. Like my OCD has always been in even numbers, and 8 was the best number. Now, 8 and 4 seem bad. But good at the same time. So doing rituals feels impossible, I can never get that ' just right ' feeling anymore. The constant worry, doubt, and self-loathing is slowly draining me. And on top of all that a level exams, suicidal thoughts, family disruption, and constant tiredness, just not coping.
I am awaiting a refer letter to a new pyschiatrist for another assessment. To be honest, I am not going to go. I know I should. But I went to the doctor to get instant help, to start something then, instead he seemed almost shocked that I had bothered coming, as if I had completely wasted his time, wasted an appointment. I felt so stupid going, I didn't even talk, my nan did. Then i left the room and burst into tears. Telling him about the rituals, and how I have failed to make any friends here yet, he just kept going over that. Making me feel pretty worthless and stupid.

"So, I'm struggling with a new OCD theme and its completely turned everything I know about treatment against my favor.
My fear is that I'll always be ruminating, stuck on the same useless thoughts forever. So then, I think, """"""""Nah, thats just my OCD talking."""""""" Well, then I think about how that could be seeking certainty. In fact, my therapists always tell me, """"""""It may be a real possibility, but you have to live your life anyway."""""""" Well, the problem with that is now, I'm thinking, """"""""Okay, I could be or I might be stuck on the same useless thoughts forever, but I have to try and live anyway."""""""" Well, for one, if I ACTUALLY AM stuck on the thoughts and they won't move, then I can't focus on anything else except those thoughts. If that fear happens to be true, then I can't focus on anything else.
A day later, I start to notice that my thoughts aren't stuck and they are drifting to other things. Well, this could technically be reassurance. So, paying attention to other things may just be reassurance that my thoughts aren't stuck. Okay, I think, this is ridiculous. I'm allowed to live my life and not think every single thing I do is in effort to get reassurance, such as hanging out with friends, reading books, watching films, etc. But, anytime I want to have lesiure, something in my mind says """"""""You're seeking reassurance by focusing your attention on these things.""""""""
I'm stuck and I don't know how to get unstuck. My OCD is finding everything technical to throw in my face. If we wanted to look at it on a larger scale, people hang out with their friends, read books, watch films, etc. for coping skills. Also, if we wanted to look at that technically, they are using coping skills subconsciously to get out of their head, to relieve anxiety. People without OCD avoid, seek reassurance, mentally review and even ruminate on certain subjects.
I'm taking these guidelines for dealing with my OCD fear down to a unhealthy, technical level.

I don't know if this happened because the room was dark and my eyes weren't accustomed to the light, when I first opened the blinds, I don't know if this is normal but this kind of event contributes to my fear of having something more serious.
Sometimes I can't tell where some noises are coming from and when I walk my dog late at night some trees first look people.

But of course they can do it - however they won't. Their OCD is telling them to practice avoidance; and the more we give in and avoid, the more rules and restrictions the disorder will impose upon us. 
We avoid because OCD uses an irrational core belief with each theme of OCD, and our mind believes this core belief, an alert is sounded and disorder and compulsing follow.

"Imagine this. You are spilling all your thoughts out to your psychotherapist, thinking """"""""hey this feels pretty good - the solution to all my OCD must be to spill it all out"""""""", when suddenly, bam! You get the intrusive thought """"""""what if I had some thoughts that I couldn't spill to my therapist"""""""".
Sure enough, in all its creativity, your OCD comes up with something that fits the criteria. You begin ruminating about dirty-talking to your psychotherapist, or even worse, raping them. Clearly, this is a thought that would be outright hard, if not almost impossible, to share.
Imagine the embarrassment! The awkwardness - after that you wouldn't be able to open up comfortably to them ever again. Even worse, what if you scare them. And then you go on to think about all the horrible things that could happen.
I guess one solution to this would be group-counseling, and/or counseling with more than one therapist. It would be less embarassing. But giving in like this would probably be feeding the OCD monster.
This is exactly what happened to me.
I would ruminate about tourettes-ing inappropriate dirty talk to my counselor while we were alone in the room. I was too chicken to 'confess' these thoughts to her.
Every living second I would dread that week's upcoming counseling session. The fact that I kept going to these sessions must have had some element of ERP in it, but the anxiety didn't seem to be going away.
Exceptionally, with the 10% of my concentration that wasn't dealing with the anxiety, we managed to deal with a lot of the aspects of my OCD that I was comfortable enough to share. Did I successfully have her fooled? Surely as a psych professional she should be able to see right through me.
I 'graduated' from that season of counseling without ever telling this dark dirty secret. But now I worry that if I ever need to seek counseling again, the same thing will happen. There will be so much anxiety, the counseling would be ineffective, and worse of all, what if my ruminations came true?
What do you think would be the best course of action in such a nasty situation?

Im glad i can do such a positive post
with the help of these forums, suggested books and some work on my part the 'harm' thoughts id experience about my children are few and far between & when i do get them im able to respond in a much more healthier way
I have new helpful tools i use, im not engaging in compulsive behaviours and self guided ERP to a degree. 
Ive just started high intensity CBT to work on the only intrusive thought that bothers me which is of a self harm / sucidal nature (i have NO intent nor want or plan) 
My therapist has pointed out the most of my worries fears and concerns are actually driven by the hypervigilence seen in generalised anxiety disorder which i will have to have separate CBT for. 
But has asked why im able to understand harm thoughts of my children are rediculous & that my core values is that i love my children deeply yet i cant apply the same value to myself (something we will be exploring) 
As part of my homework shes asked me what my current issues are and what my goals are during CBT. 
the most obvious would be to not have the self harm thoughts at all ...but im well aware a therapist cant stop those thoughts or give certainty one way or the other.

I am Nicholas and my OCD type is about contamination, fear to spread HIV to people you love, and have some mental rituals to verify some actions were correct. I wonder to know if anybody can explain me something about the CBT real meaning because I doubt if my psychologist is using it and the medication seems not to work out properly.

"Hi
I've recently started CBT at long last (after waiting 7 months)and it's going ok, the psychologist I see is really nice and seems to know about OCD. My main problems OCD wise are mental rituals and ruminating or analysing and constantly 'improving' these mental rituals. At the moment the rumination aspect is the most difficult as I find it hard to leave things unless they are 'resolved' and this can take days and then another 'problem' with the ritual comes along and I have to analyse and refine the ritual until it is 'ok'.
So anyway my therapist did want me to try cutting out a ritual but after I told her I was having more problems with the rumination aspect she suggested i try to stop that instead. She's said she doesn't expect me to be able to stop completely but now i'm thinking maybe this is too big a thing to stop and if i do something bad will happen (I have magical thinking OCD). Is this just my OCD telling me not to stop the rumination? Or is it really too big a step? And also has anyone managed to overcome a similar sort of OCD? I've tried giving myself a set time to ruminate and then stop but then I just end up going back.

"Hiya
I saw my therapist last thursday and I only have two sessions left as he finishes at christmas and I must admit when I saw him I said I had been okay I mean I have my morning rituals and evening rituals but they aren't bothering me that much just now if that makes sense as they don't take up too much time and he said in time I will stop doing them anyway. Also not had much obsessive thoughts lately either so that's good too even though I have had alot of things going on lately like changes as my partner has now moved in as someone said to the benefits that he was living here even though he wasn't so in the end we would have lived together next february so we have done it now.
So cut a long story short I don't know how to feel that its finishing with this guy as we talk alot and what he taught me was to concentrate on mindfulness and I told him there is someone that is going to teach me meditation and he said grab that with both hands as once you learn how to do that you learn to be more relaxed and see the nonsense of the mental chatter in your head. He also told me weeks ago that sometimes people will see him and say they hadn't had a panic attack for ages then the next day they will. My OCD I have thought about it but not too much and also today my son had a boy tell him I was lazy and a fat ****h and this upset my son as I am largely overweight which I am doing something about but this upset me today am I now being normal I know that sounds a weird question that I am accepting whats normal and whats not?
If I'm confusing anyone just say :blushing: as I have felt a tiny OCDish but not majorly don't know if the clomipramine doing the job or me as I'm only on 50mg?

I deliberated long and hard and basically didn't write down a thought but more like something I could never do involving killing a member of my family and it's now kicked my OCD into overdrive with guilt etc and I now have to look at this for several minutes a day as homework for next week, to say I'm anxious is an understatement and any advice would be happily received thank you.","['Thought', 'guilt', 'OCD']",['spike'],"['Thought', 'spike', 'OCD', 'guilt']",1.0,,,,
"So I've been doing CBT for a few weeks now and I would say, considering how bad it was at the start, it has been going well. I have been doing exposures pretty much every day, and I have been able to do more or less every exposure (apart from one but me and my therapist agreed that it was probably to be expected at first).
I touch something that I know someone else has touched every day, and resist washing my hands for 15 minutes. This will later to be increased to 30 minutes, then and hour, etc.
I also have to use a pen which someone else has used; firstly just touch it, then use it for 15 minutes, then for a whole lesson (in school that is).
I feel kind of positive about it in some ways, but in other ways I am feeling very 'in the thick of it' right now. I feel like it is all just too overwhelming, and although it's supposed to get easier I kind of feel like each exposure is adding on to the next and in a way it's getting harder.
I mean, yeah, I am now much more capable of say touching a chair without thinking about it for ten minutes before hand, but still the overall thought of having been touching chairs, etc. all week is really overwhelming!
I'm not sure what to say. I feel as though the idea of getting better is suddenly very dangerous and worrying; how do I know that it won't one day have severe effects? I am aware that, so far, I have not been ill. And I understand that CBT is about looking at past exposures and rationalizing, considering that nothing bad has happened in the past. BUT, part of my OCD is that I feel as though I could pick up 'bad-habits' in the long-term, and that washing my hands religiously is to avoid 'not washing hands' becoming a habit in the future, which would cause me to be sick, etc.
I have explained this to my therapist and she assures me that CBT will get easier over time and I will realise that I won't ever get ill just from touching an object. But nevertheless I am feeling incredibly overwhelmed and it's all moving very fast. What should I do?

Just wondering- what are your targets for this week in terms of CBT/ERP (e.g. exposure tasks or homework) or other therapy targets (e.g. learning mindfulness techniques/relaxation)?
I think I need to set myself one but I can't think what to start with!
I think sometimes it's difficult when you're not actively undergoing CBT to set targets but maybe also quite important?

So over the last week I have changed my point of view on OCD. I am trying to remove the fear from my theme hoping this will help me find the truth and remove the threat. This has been very hard. It has resulted in far more ruminating as would be expected I suppose. If I accept what I have obsessed about for the past year then this is difficult and stirring up lots of emotions. I read somewhere and it seems true that OCD is a fear of fear so if we can remove the the fear. Even if they're true it's not the end of the world. This change has resulted in my ruminations going through the roof this week. Hopefully once I grow to accept that it might be true and the consequences are not what I fear then I can stop the ruminations.

"Dear all
I'm new to this board. I thought it might be a good idea to tell you about how my OCD has gone. In fact, I am a bit worried about this because one of my fears is punishment because someone reads what I write and tells the police. Me posting this is therefore very stressful. Deep breath.....
I started to have troubling ocd problems around age 20,these mostly focused around checking,plugs,taps,the cooker,windows and other household things.It got to the point where I could not leave the house unless I had done hours of checking,and going to bed was a nightmare.Then I began to fear contamination,though still having the checking rituals,it was totally debilitating,and disabled my life.Then I began to think I could contaminate others,and if I did my DNA would be on them and if they were murdered or raped I would get the blame.Then I started to wonder why I was worried about these things,it was not normal, I started to question my morality,was I capable of these crimes,I questioned this so much that I started to get confused when previouslyI thought I had always been a good person,now doubt crept in.However I always reassured myself that I had never done anything,then I thought was I sure I had never done anything,like rape murder or paedophilia?I started to ruminate about my past,but I could never find a dastardly thing that I had done however slowly I became convinced that I had done something it was just that I could not remember it.Then one day I read an article about a murder that had taken place in an area where I used to live,the murder had taken place over 25 years before.However I was sure I had never been to the location of the murder and reassured myself with this thought,slowly I started to question this premise,until I cast so much doubt over it that I became convinced that I had to read more about this crime on the internet,because it would reasssure me that I had not done it.Before I looked on the internet I knew very little about the crime,I could vaguely remember it a s a news event in the past that every one was shocked by.However I did not know when it had happened,i.e. the exact year or date,exactly where it had happened,who the victim was,how they had been murdered,etc.When I looked it up I got a lot of information about it,and at first it reassured me that I was not responsible.
But over time I started to doubt the reassurance,I began to imagine that I had been there,this was in order to convince myself that I could not have committed such an evil thing,and that in fact I had not been there.I also started to doubt the idea that I had never been in the location where it had happened,maybe I had been and it was all just deeply buried in my memory.Soon I started to question whether the imaginings where actual memories. I kept ruminating in order to find mental proof that it was not me that was responsible.I started to question my morality,would I be capable of such a deed,more and more I questioned until I became totally confused and full of fear and dread.
Now I find myself in the position where I do not think I did this terrible crime but I cannot convince or reassure myself totally that I did not do it.Also I fear saying that I did in conversations or that I will write it down somewhere.I avoid conversations as much as possible and never use pens and it dominates my waking thoughts,it is ruining my life and sometimes I feel like ending it all.","['Rituals', 'shock', 'OCD', 'checking', 'fear', 'Thought']",[],"['shock', 'fear', 'checking', 'Rituals', 'Thought', 'OCD']",,1.0,,,

"Just sharing a possible line of inquiry that some people might be interested in.
I recently learned that some people with anxiety disorders take chelated magnesium supplements. It's an NMDA receptor antagonist, which is why I started taking it originally (and not taking calcium at the same time), in the hope of lowering or slowing my tolerance to my stimulant medication. Then I found out that lots of people also take it for anxiety disorders.
Personally, I've only been taking it for about a week, 450mg per day in two installments, and what I found immediately is that it's quite sedating, so I now take the first 150mg in the day, and then 300mg shortly before I go to bed. I can't say for sure whether or not it's directly helping my anxiety already, because it usually comes and goes throughout the day and over different weeks anyway, so unless something usually stops me worrying completely for 4 hours or more like my stimulant, I can never be too sure whether it works or the drop-off in rumination is coincidental. In the long-term, not being deficient as many people are, helps you to make use of omega 3 and other nutrients linked to mental health, so in the long-term I'm hoping it will have some mental health benefits. But in the short-term, it definitely sedates me, which at least indirectly lowers my anxiety.
Most people are saying magnesium oxide is a waste of money because it has very low bio-availability. Consensus seems to be that chelated magnesium is the form to look out for.

I have OCD thoughts which at the moment focus on the fact that I may have hurt someone accidentally/on purpose while walking about/driving during the course of my day. I have spent the last 3 or 4 years checking back all the tiem to see that this has not happened.
I have never been to my GP with my ocd but have read alot on the subject and have felt like I am strong enough to deal with it alone (with the help of my wife), I recently started my own DIY cbt, and have tried my best to stop checking back, I began this on friday but since then have come up against some situations when I have really had to battle against the urge to check, but still I have managed not to. Now my head is so cloudy ruminating about the what if's - """"""""maybe you did hurt someone and didn't check because you wanted to do it, or you momentarily went mad and did something"""""""", deep down I know none of the thoughts/feelings are real but I am finding it so hard to move on with my thoughts. I am even feelng guilty if I manage to forget them for a few minutes. I am having so many spikes I can't even remember them all!
My OCD has also been raking up old i(long forgotton) instances where I was unable to check back (due to company etc) and telling me that I did not do so because I know i have hurt someone, all of this is so strongly against the person I know that I am and makes me feel pretty miserable. I don't know how I be able to move on form here as I know I never be able to resolve old ocd thoughts, this also gets me down.
Maybe it's time I got professional help?

"I've been to see my therapist today and told her about this but just needed a bit more convincing.
I'm trying so hard to control my ocd and not dwell on things or carry out my rituals. But the other day something happened that threatens to set me off again.
I went shopping for a present for my friend's wedding. As I was at a checkout I began thinking about when the shop assistant gives you a used bag that someone else has brought something back in. I hate it. I don't know why, I don't suffer from contamination ocd (or at least, I hope not!). But I just feel 'why me? why give me a used one? do I not deserve a nice, new clean one?'
Anyway, I got a new one at that shop. However, when I went to the next one I GOT A USED BAG!! I couldn't believe it. Not only was it screwed up and a bit ripped, but it had what I can only describe as 'brown gunk' on the bottom. I really didn't want to scrutinise it. So I asked the shop assistant for another bag and he gave me one but as I walked out of the shop, all I could think was 'It was because I'd been thinking about it! I made that happen! Is it a coincidence???? Why did he give me the bag and not the fella in front of me?????????'
Now my therapist has told me that because I have such an issue about a used bag, I probably think about it every single time I'm at a checkout. Yes, I probably do. And she said that there is a chance you can be given a used bag but I have linked it to thinking about it earlier, whereas I probably always think it, but 9 times out of 10, I don't get a used bag. (How many times have I used the term 'used bag' so far? I hate them!!) Does that make sense?
Does anyone else get this? Is she right? I know she is, I suppose I just want reassurance. This happened to me a while ago with something else and I posted about that too. It's as if the ocd is going for an almighty whallop every time it seems I'm beating it.
Julie
p.s reading this through, it sounds like i'm a snob! honestly, that isn't the case. It's not the fact the bag is used, it's the fact I think the assistant thinks they can give me one because i'm not important or something. I feel like they don't think I'm worth it etc

"Hi everyone
This is the first time I've posted a message, though have been an avid reader of your posts for some time and this forum has been a source of great comfort. Thanks
I believe I have obssessive type thoughts, though have never spoken to anyone about these. About a year and a half ago I reached crisis point and was very depressed and anxious. I was prescribed cipralex for anxiety mainly, but I have felt for some time that OCD was the main cause.
I feel so much better now and received support from my GP, CPN, family and friends, the internet and self-help books. As regards the OCD it's still there, but in a much milder form - I still have spikes, but they subside quite quickly - I feel that a lot of this reduction in severity is due to the medication. However it will always probably be there and I find this hard to deal with, though I'm trying hard to accept it.
I'd like to be meds free, but this is not an issue for me at present and I may have to be on cipralex for a long time. Just wondered if anyone had any advice on how to make progress from that stage when you're coping with life, the OCD has lost it's grip, but it's still lurking there in the shadows. I've read 'Brain Lock' and 'Imp of the Mind' and try to let upsetting thoughts pass through my mind, etc.,etc. Is there much else that therapy or CBT for example could teach me? I feel like I've reached an impasse. I'm grateful that I've come this far, but know I've still a way to go.

Doctor reviewed my meds few months ago and told me to decrease 10mg every 3 weeks until down to 40mg. Had appointment 2 weeks ago and he said to try to come down even slower to stop meds totally, though I may find I will need small dose forever
Have been really struggling with decrease from 40mg to 30mg. Having crying bursts, lots of spikes again about red marks etc and negative emotions.

My psych doesn't really believe in the biological bas-es of mental disorder-s and I think that plays a role in her view.

"Hi there. I am not too sure why I am posting this but maybe it is in the hope that someone can help me in some way with what is going on right now. If not then at least I hope by writing this down, if nothing else it will get this **** out of my head and that may help. For those of you who dont know me I suffer from Pure O. I have had OCD for 22 years. I had 10 terrible years and then 9 great years and now unfortunately I have had another 3 terrible years. To be honest the word terrible doesn't do justice to my experience over the last three years.
My OCD is Religious OCD. For the last three years I have had the thought that I choose the devil over Jesus and that I align myself with the devil. This has caused me so much torment and torture and it has left me feeling suicidal with guilt. It all started after my girlfriend of four years left me for someone else. I was incredibly depressed and then my doctor changed my medication. As soon as he did that the OCD came back with a vengence and has never left since. So I was majorly depressed and now with OCD too. In-fact it has only gotten worse. One night shortly after that I had a thought in my head who do I choose - the devil or Jesus - and I think I chose the devil although I dont want to. From then on this thought has tortured me endlessly. Everyday for the last three years. For the first two years I would ritualise to try and stop it and prove the thoughts wrong but I could never do the rituals properly and so I have become even more convinced I want the devil. I still ritualise now from time to time and everytime I do I always lose and can never do what I have to to prove I want Jesus. My rituals are normally around blowing out air, which to me means blowing out the devil. I know it may all seem mad to you but I guess OCD is not normal. So now I am convinced I want the devil and I hate myself for it.
Then in the last few weeks I have had harming thoughts come into my head too. These are thoughts about killing people and they also terrify me. What I think now is since I have accepted that I want the devil then that means I have followed through and acted on one of the thoughts therefore I should do the same with the thought about killing people. I should follow this through and act it out because that is what I have done with the thought about the devil. But I don't want the devil......i don't think! It's the OCD that tells me that but yet it seems so true. I believe it but wish I didn't.
I am so mixed up. I am exhaustd. I feel like I am on the verge of snapping and going crazy or having a mental breakdown. The only thing keeping me sane right now is Lorazepam. I have to take it everyday as it is the only thing that keeps me sane. That in itself is a problem as it is addictive and sooner or later I will have to come off it. I am not seeing a counsellor at the moment and have not seen anyone who was any decent for nearly 9 months. But I dont see how a counsellor can help me.
I am so mixed up and tired. I wish I didn't want the devil and wanted Jesus. But I feel like I am a bad person and therefore I feel like I deserve bad things. I am scared. I dont want any of this. I just want to get better but I dont believe that is possible. I feel scarred from this experience over the last three years in a way that makes me question how it is possible to ever get over this and move on with my life. Gosh I could talk for hours right now but I wont. I will leave this here. Any advice you can give me would be greatly appreciated. Thank you.

"Hi all,
I've had many experiences of 'pure' OCD in terms of the kind of vile thoughts that can infiltrate into my mind, but at the moment it is so confusing I might not explain it very well. It revolves around life. Yep the biggest topic of all. Literally for months now I've been going """"""""What is life? What makes us happy? Why do we dislike things but like others? What is our purpose?"""""""" etc etc etc. Sometimes these questions turn nasty, which gives me an anxiety spike. I suppose the reason my worries have kept with these philosophical all knowing questions is that there isn't an answer to them: its all down to interpretation. But of course I end up like """"""""What if I interpret this wrong? What if I thought differently to what I normally think like?"""""""" and other such gibberish. I'm having trouble enacting the """"""""aware, but don't act"""""""" method which has worked for me in the past to this topic. I assume I just have to keep plugging at it. I'm genuinely determined to beat this, but some days I do get depressed because I haven't fully 'answered' these ruminating questions. Its beyond irritating!

"hello
I went for a take out meal to a Chinese takeaway on Saturday and on leaving had a thought did I harm someone while in there. (I cant write the exact thought as is too bad). I made the mistake of stopping to check and so anxiety went sky high, had to check several times of course as once is never enough. I made the next mistake of going past later at night as I was going to meet friends to check again. I went past twice again on Sunday and on Monday as it is on my way to work.
 I didn't check today but am considering going to work a different way tomorrow so I wont be able to check. Would this be avoidance?
This episode has me feeling really depressed as it has been a long time since I checked anything to this extent. OCD has some nasty tricks.
I have just had the thought is this one long rumination which I should just try to ignore and carry on as usual and try not to check tomorrow?
Sorry for posting on here again but I live alone (friends not really involved) and need to sort my head out.

"After a few weeks without visiting the foruns it is time to write a few words again. I had problems with excessive time spending while researching yoga but could be with another subject. As suggested here I established a daily period for this research so I could not overdo it. Then as the time spended on research diminished I started noticing an increasing in depression. Actually for more than 6 months that I never felt so depressed like the last days. Fortunately today I feel much better. I was thinking that I could be having a depression relapse. Usually I can control depression with some sucess using CBT. Only very recently I recognized my compulsive behaviours which are so difficult to control. But I think that like recurrent depression is a situation that needs to be managed instead of thinking in a cure. And it is a daily work.

just wondering if other people have these type of issues. Well I have Compulsive Skin Picking. But Ive noticed that impulse control in general seems to be a bit of a problem for me. Lately I have binge eating, also called comfort eating and have trouble saying no to junk food or over indulging especially when I get depressed. Now sometimes when I manage to resist temptation of junk food, I find myself wanting to splurge at the shops. I almost feel like I deserve a reward, especially when I feel depressed. I just have trouble I guess with impulse control, as at the shops I buy things I don't need. they are not expensive things thank god, but because I am unemployed and often bored I find going to the shops can distract me or can be seen as pampering myself when i am depressed and can end up spending money in order to lift my mood. I also spend so long being indecisive and overwhelmed at the shops, and then get really tired mentally and end up buying whatever as i am so sick of rationalising whether or not i need it? i just think stuff it, and i end up buying too much stuff. there have been times where i literally wander around the shops going back and forth between aisles or different sections, thinking should i buy it? should i leave it? i wonder if anyone else has found they have these compulsive eating/shopping urges? and if these behaviours sometimes replace one another at different times? thanks
yes i do. i give money away if i cant spend it. my ocd is more cleaning and positioning and i struggle to use the loo. need to count to 40 first, ha ha. although im not in debt i do give/spend my wages on others due to the great feeling of self satisfaction after it. i was in a house fire and spent some time in bristol priory. i was diagnosed with ocd. gad, depression, insomnia and post traumatic stress disorder. i seem to have recovered from most but cant shake the ocd. the reason i have contacted this website is because i have actually started to enjoy the ocd and dont know if its a symptom or something else. looking for a bit of direction. there are lots of things that set me off. i find im worse if im tired or had a few beers is this normal too????????","['Compulsive eating pattern', 'hopping', 'satisfaction', 'depression', 'insomnia', 'site', 'joy', 'symptom', 'Food', 'urge', 'OCD']",[],"['urge', 'site', 'hopping', 'depression', 'Compulsive eating pattern', 'joy', 'symptom', 'insomnia', 'satisfaction', 'Food', 'OCD']",,1.0,,,
"Hi all,
I am having therapy at the moment for my conatmination issues, and one of the 'tasks' my therapist set is to be able to walk near my doormat without freaking out and doing my usual compulsive behaviour.
In my house, you have to walk past my front door (with mat in front of it) to get into our spare room. Beacause of the mat there, I hate going in this room, thankfully it is not a room I have to go in all the time, but the heating thermostat is in there so I do have to at least once a day.
Also obviously I have to get near my mat when I open the front door, see this is how bad this is, most people with probably tread on the mat to open the door, but I sort of lean forward to open door, and never stand on the mat. (Think when i open the door people must think I am mad!) Then there is the issue of post landing on the mat.
I feel rediculas writing about this, how can you be scared of a mat! Everytime I open the door, walk past the mat / door area or collect the post, I have the complusion to clean. I wear a different pair of slippers in this part of my house, roll up my jeans, so hem doesnt touch mat, I wash my feet after walking past the area (feet are exposed due to sandal slippers), and if I have to pick up post I wash up arms, hands and change my top, all beacause I got near the mat! agghhh
I cant do this task, I am trying, I follow the 4 steps,
Step 1: Relabel
Step 2: Reattribute
Step 3: Refocus
Step 4: Revalue
but I really find this one a tough one, cause for so long I have had this issue with the mat, I feel increadibly dirty if I dont complete the cleaning behaviour. I cant handle feeling this dirty. So far, I have walked pats the mat into front room, I feel i need to wash, then I have opened post, I did wash my hands after this one, but I still feel soooo dirty! :helpsmilie:

I dont think I can seek help as I have said in the past as I am a teacher (unemployed) but if I get help it'll be on my records that im depressed and have ocd then I prob wont get a job as they do a health check on you and look at medical records.
Is seeing a pychiatrist confidential or do their notes and stuff go on your medical records? Im assuming it has to go on?
Im worried as I dont want to be morngy and moody as im ruining my familys life and one day I will think why was I such as bitch and took life for granted and it'll be too late!
I dont know how id cope without a particular family member! I dont talk about ocd with anyone (apart from here) any more as I dont want to upset them and they dont understand I also fear I stressthem out and they'll get ill or die.
I feel lost and low and depressed and I dont know what to do.
My ocd doesn't seem as bad either however I think the annoyance and irritation is part of it. I do keep getting irritated by mess and towels sorting the stupid towels!
Im worried my ocd might get worse in life if i dont try sort it now! I thought i was developing another type of ocd the other week like not remember if i did or didnt do something and i dont want that!
Help? Dont know how though ha x","['talking', 'fear', 'irritation', 'Thought', 'OCD']",['spike'],"['talking', 'irritation', 'fear', 'Thought', 'spike', 'OCD']",1.0,,,,
"I thought I would start this thread up, as it is a subject with which we must all deal, and something where sharing experience should definitely help each other. Techniques we use should also help in non-OCD situations. 
I will start us off with some things I have learned. 
Others In Denial Or Don't Understand 
This is where the charity OCD-UK can really help. On their website, easily accessible by the link from the forums, is a """"""""how can we help you"""""""" thread, and there is lots of information and downloadables to help with this. 
Others Refuse To Help, Think They Know Best 
Again rhe charity can help from its website, with detail about OCD. But essentially, we cannot just stop doing rituals, or switch our minds off - they are reacting to false core beliefs and exaggerations and resultant responses which have become learned behaviours, and it takes training and gradual behavioural changes to stop these OCD responses. 
Disagreements And Arguments 
When affected by OCD we are far more brittle and edgy, and get easily drawn into disagreements and antagonising. 
Best therefore to recognise this, and ask others if possible to defer the discussion until we are a little better and can give it and them the necessary attention to detail. 
If arguments threaten to occur, try using the technique my wife and I use - the """"""""high controversiality""""""""  rule. 
If one of us deems the subject deeply upsetting, we defer the discussion. In the intervening period we both consider the matter with the heat taken out of it, and usually when we reconvene ideas have occurred which allow a compromise and resolution

"Hi there everyone
What I am about to ask in no way condones illegal drug use so please DO NOT feel that this is an advert, it is an experience speaking. I guess you could say that I am at a quandary as to marijuana and its effects on OCD. Though I do not currently use marijuana I was a very regular smoker from the ages of 19 to 25. I cannot decide whether I started using marijuana as a self medication technique to rid myself of my OCD and depression symptoms or if marijuana actually caused my symptoms to worsen or amplified the under lying condition to a permanent level?
I know that alcohol is known to worsen OCD symptoms the next day and I personally know this to be true with marijuana but what I REALLY want to know is if marijuana caused my condition or made it permanently worse? There must be loads of people here who have never touched marijuana but still have bad OCD right? Perhaps I would be exactly the same had I never had touched marijuana and this is merely another one of my ruminations? Help is needed to shed some light on the subject so I would really appreciate some response if you have the time.
Many thanks and peace to all

"Hello everybody!

I've been ocd-free for a year and that's why it's so scary to return in this condition. I have pure ocd... My spike is pedophilia. I am constantly worrying that I might be a pedo:( Sometimes it goes away and I even work with children because I'm a teacher. But today I saw a naked toddler and it spiked me..
I have no doctor in my country and I do everything myself. I just need some support from people who can understand me..",['OCD'],['spike'],"['spike', 'OCD']",1.0,,,,
"Although I realise that ocd lies and distorts our thoughts I am really struggling with one thing - how to distinguish between when i should worry and when it is ocd doing its best. When would someone without ocd worry about something against when I do??
Years ago when my now 22 year old was 2, a neighbour accused me of hitting her son who was also 2, as he went home crying because my daughter didn't want to play with him.
I tully believe this is where my ocd stems from, if that is even possible to have a route cause??
Anyway, my current theme is worrying about being accused of touching children in an inappropriate manner. My concern is, if I can get accused of hitting a child when I did not, what is stopping someone accusing me of touching them inappropriatly? This is really causing me concern right now. As the way I see it, people can get accused of doing things when there are in fact innocent.
I thought I was getting through this when a random thing came on TV today and a has resparked this fear into me. 
I'm sorry for the long post, it has been hard for me to post this and open up to this horrid situation from all those years ago but thanks for reading. Lisa

"Hello everyone!
hope all is well?
I have been away for the last week with my partner and it was totally amazing getting away from london, and looking at properties for the near future.
Had quite a few spikes while i was there, and they passed. My partner even helped me with my CBT homework (were told we could)
Ive been seeing the fears for what they are alot easier, but as some of u may know i had a text message from a GU clinic for a 2nd hep booster which is overdue (from last july)
This did play on my mind for a few days, but it passed.
Last night i was getting quite upset as i knew i was going back alone to london and didnt want to leave, and for some reason i went on auto pilot and searched hepititis when my partner left the room to fix dinner.
I feel TERRIBLE for doing this, but i couldnt stop myself, i managed to speed read through about 4 sites and shut them down as i felt sooo guilty.
nothing really sinked in and i dont know why i did it tbh, i still dont know much about hep.
What i did see which has sparked off my fears is that it can be spread mainly through sharing needles. This stuck in my head as i used a lancet of my mothers last sept and that was a major HIV fear for me at the time, and it states that hep can live in the air longer etc.
i want to research more but i have promised myself and my boyfriend that i wont, i had 1 booster back in july when they took my blood for a HIV test. Im sure they tested my then for hep but cant be certain
but then the logic kicks in thinking """"""""they must have tested my and it must have been negative, why would they give me boosters to protect me otherwise""""""""
does that make sense?
my mind was sooooooo obsessed with HIV at the time that all other results they told me fell on deaf ears.","['hope', 'site', 'guilt', 'fear']",['spike'],"['site', 'fear', 'spike', 'hope', 'guilt']",1.0,,,,
"I'd like to congratulate OCD for ruining my life.

I have lost the battle. The past few months I've lost my job, my identity, my sex drive and my will to live. 

Going through my latest 'theme' of OCD has finished me off. I've mentioned before in other topics about how this came about so I don't want to go over old ground. But I've gone through this before and it took me years to get over it and feel 'normal' again. This time though I'm 30 years old and I haven't got time to fix myself. I'm numb, I get headaches when I try to think 'normally' and I've just had enough. I sleep to get away from my thoughts. I'd love to feel back to my old self again.

I've tried it all. Therapy/CBT, different medication. None of it works. I have nowhere else to go.
Everyone is having getting married, having families whilst I can't even get aroused by the opposite sex anymore yet only a year or so ago a simple touch from my ex girlfriend would spark me into life. That seems so far away now.

"Having just gotten over two trying episodes of worrying about my current contamination theme and feeling happy on a nice, sunny day I was walking out of a skytrain/subway station that has a large entrance (no door) when I heard a guy say to his friends, first time I saw a bat. It seemed that they were looking up towards a corner where a bat might have trouble getting out. I stopped and looked up to where they were looking but saw nothing but am still worried. I was in shock so my mouth was partly open so worry about bat saliva. I'm not 100% sure that they were really looking towards the corner or whether they for sure said bat but I think so. I walked for a long time hoping anything on me would be gone with the sun but still am struggling with this. I had something to take back to the store but couldn't do it. Eventually I went home. Something I read in Tiny Buddha regarding anxiety about not feeling like a victim seems to ring true to me with this kind of thing. And hundreds or thousands of passengers are walking through the same area as I was. But it seems so significant to me. (I have gone camping in the past with bats flying around, but I wasn't terrified then and didn't think of what they might carry). Kind of fed up with my brain running into these things.

"Hello everyone.
I have had moderate to severe OCD since birth. I had turned 30 a couple months ago, and still single with no girlfriend, plus being still a virgin. On and off for most of my 20s I kept ruminating about this topic. But since Christmas, which I spent completely alone, the ruminations have increased a lot. I probably think about how I am a failure due to being single/virgin at least 40 seconds of every minute that I am awake. These ruminations threw me into a depressive state in which I currently find myself.
As expected, the constant ruminations and feeling of despair and failure caused my immune system to get destroyed. This usually happens when I keep thinking over and over about something, and causes my body excess stress. On New Year's Eve, I caught some sort of nasal viral infection, which I still have. I have been trying to avoid ruminating about being a single/virgin 30 year old male, since it affects my physical health as well--in addition to Pure O ruminations messing up my immune system, I was also diagnosed with chronic hypertension at the age of 26 mostly because of stress--but I still keep ruminating and fell into a bad depression. Numerous failures in dating and romance has just caused the ruminations to increase.
Does anyone ruminate about something similar to this? This really feels like hell.","['OCD', 'despair', 'Hypertension', 'depression']",['rumination'],"['rumination', 'OCD', 'depression', 'Hypertension', 'despair']",1.0,,,,
"Hi, I'm having a real rough few months. Everytime I try and get on with my life,my OCD is prodding me in the back all the time and making me question absolutely everything,so much so now that I don't trust myself. When I'm busy I can kind of keep most of the anxiety and ruminations at bay, but the times when I seem to have to myself to try and relax and not think,these are the worse for me. It is just relentless ruminations. The other night I was on my iPad,which I know isn't good when it's late and I should've gone to bed,but I was browsing Facebook then realised it was late,for some reason I felt a bit panicky and the thought came to me that I shouldn't put in anything inappropriate to do with children as a search. I think I remember shutting my iPad cover quickly and cuddling my dog on the floor... However now I'm constantly searching my memory to go over whether or not I did that. My brain has now created a completely different story in which I had put in a search and found an inappropriate site to look at! This is killing me with guilt,again and I'm now trying to think about what it was,who they were,how old etc,etc. The thing is that by doing this I'm creating a memory in my head that possibly isn't true and getting so panicked and racked with guilt. Everytime I get close to being relaxed or trying to cope with my OCD,my brain will come up with another set of problems. Just the other week,again whilst I was trying to relax,the thought( and again it seems to hit me a few hours later) came to me that for some reason I had grabbed a child from the street and kept them locked in my house for a few hours and nobody knew! Just where does this come from? I can't bear this for much longer, I have suffered now for so many years I don't know how to stop this constant bombardment of fears and worries that sicken me so much. I had a period of doing ok but now I just think that deep down I'm a bad person and I'm always trying to hide it. I'm always having to check that I'm not going to do anything bad,but my brain is now trying to find ways to come up with things that nobody would ever know about,apart from me. I would really appreciate any advice on this,as in how to move forward and not let these thoughts become so crippling and also how not to create more to try and prove that you did nothing wrong. I find it hard to explain exactly but hopefully this all makes sense to some people.

"Things have been a little bit better recently with OCD, I’m having longer periods of time where I feel better. But I do also find myself slipping into ruminations, and I am absolute garbage at the whole ‘leave it unresolved’ part of the deal. I can definitely identify when I have these slip-ups and I know the hardest part is to just breath and allow it to happen without forcing it away. It’s been difficult but manageable!
Anyway, the main issue is an odd and personal one. I recently met somebody and things have been going well, I think this may well end up in a relationship between myself and her. Along with the excitement and anxiety of that situation has come a wave of OCD essentially trying to ruin it. Does anybody have any advice about OCD in situations with a partner? I can just see it going so badly and I really don’t want it to, and I know the more I strive for it to be ‘good’, the more OCD will thrive off that unattainable goal. After I’ve been doing so well too! But I can’t let it get in the way of this and control my life.","['anxiety', 'anxiety', 'OCD']",['rumination'],"['rumination', 'anxiety', 'OCD']",1.0,,,,
"Hi everyone,
I have just joined the forum and I am not someone who has been diagnosed with OCD. At the weekend i was had my drink spiked while out and had a very bad reaction to the drug. My comedown was terrible and as I would have anxiety issues I was having panic attacks. All night last night I was just repeating imagined scienarios (sp) over and over, maybe changing after a few hours to a variation of it. I was having panic attacks and got my self soo worked up that i became physically ill and passed out. My doctor gave me some sedatives and i got a few hours sleep earlier.
I have always thought acted out conversations in my head and different scienarios and i will repeat these thoughts at different times. When I am occupied during the day I am fine but sometimes I will take a line from a scienario and just repeat it randomly in my head in quiet moments. Phrases pop up and a certain phrase can stay for weeks on end until I have gotten onto something different. At the minute it is """"""""look I can't do this"""""""" and at quiet times my head will say it over and over many times during the day.
I always thought this was just me and how my head worked, that it was normal. It wasn't until tonight that I was searching the internet about my anxiety that I came across some people chating about looping thoughts.
I have not told my doctor about my anxiety or panic attacks and I know they are getting worse as is my mind chatter. Do you think I could be suffering for OCD? Night time is the worst, i take ages getting to sleep as I'm constantly thinking about conversations and then repeating it word for word.
Am working myself up tonight soo much, the diazepam the doctor has given me is making me a little anxious too. I am feeling very down and depressed about the whole thing...

"Hello
Does anyone ever feel the need to constantly explain themselves and say sorry?
For example, I sent a message to a friend (We used to talk quite a lot) and we kind of stopped talking as much so a I sent a message saying sorry if I bombarded you before when we used to talk a lot, and I didn't mean to annoy you etc, and then he said it is fine, stop worrying, nothing is wrong.... Then it was fine after that and we just carried on as normal and spoke at work, I spoke to them a few times out of work and sometimes they didn't reply, so I read into it a lot and apologized again saying I'm sorry if I irritated you again and was just worried about what they thought of me in case they thought I was really needy or something.
This was over a period of a few weeks and a few days ago I made a joke on the phone (we have to talk on the phone at work but they don't actually work in my office, if that makes sense- I haven't met them as we talk on the phone at work as they are in a different office and talk outside of work) and we normally joke on the phone anyway, so it was just our normal sarcasm jokes and they joke back too, but then I always read in to conversations I have with people, and analyze it and think, 'oh what if they think this, what if they hate me' etc.
So for example with this friend we have a running joke about me digging a hole in situations, like always embarrassing myself on the phone or saying something silly, so he made a joke about sending me a spade to help me dig myself out of the hole.
It was my birthday last week and he didn't wish me happy birthday, so I said sarcastically, 'thanks for wishing me happy birthday' and I was pretending to be mad but I think he knew I was being sarcastic as I was laughing a bit, so he said he wasn't on facebook that day (but he was because it shows when people were last online on the chat sidebar bit) so I said 'right okay, whatever I'm not entertaining this' like in a sarcastic way and the rest of the conversation was fine, we were just working on the call and joking throughout. I kept saying I was joking on the phone too and he said he knew it is okay.
Then after work I thought what if they thought I was really needy and actually being serious about being upset about them not wishing me happy birthday, and because I used to talk to them a lot before, and then constantly apologized to them in long essays they might think I was being demanding and needy, so I sent them a message just explaining it was a joke and I was worried what they thought in case they thought I was being needy- it wasn't my intentions and I didn't mean to sound demanding it was just a joke. I also thought what if they thought we weren't friends and I have gone and made myself look stupid for calling him a friend so I said something like you might not class me as a friend as we haven't met and I am sorry for all of this.
I was also worried about how bad and insecure they must think I am because I messaged them a few times apologizing (I guess for nothing really) and when they did reply to the message I sent they made a joke about they haven't read an essay in a long time, and I need to stop worrying and I should relax.
I said to him I have OCD, which is why I do worry a lot. It's frustrating for me to worry about things others don't worry about and I find it hard telling people about it, but I kind of just wanted to explain why I apologize so much- and I said I don't want people to think I am a crazy or something and some people don't understand the OCD. Then just said I had a hard time recently, and it's like constantly battling against yourself.
He just replied saying I should go on a holiday it would do me good, and then I said it's not good when it affects work and uni, and I said to him, I don't know why I am telling you all of this, you are easy to talk too, maybe it's because you are so far away or something- I meant in a good way not in a bad way, and now I am worrying about if he thought I was being mean, or horrible, (when I wasn't) as he read the message and didn't reply. Maybe he just didn't know what to say or something. I don't know!
We had a conversation on the phone at work afterwards before the weekend and he seemed fine and was still joking around like we normally do, but I am now worrying thinking he must have thought I was being horrible when I wasn't. To be fair this is probably a stupid worry and he isn't thinking about it at all!
This is just one example of me worrying about what others think, and constantly apologizing- I feel like if I apologize I can clear the air and get rid of the anxiety or something. Like I have to apologize, if I don't people will think I am a bad person.
I think I have now made the situation worse with him and he might think I am needy and really weird for mentioning my OCD as he didn't reply or something. He might of thought I was attention seeking or something when I wasn't, I just wanted to explain why I apologized so much. That I wasn't actually crazy, there is a reason behind it. It's not just him I do it too, it happened with other friends too recently where I've said sorry a lot and been feeling more anxious.
I have recently started taking fluoxetine again, so I don't know if why it is kicking in it makes me more anxious or something...I've been feeling more anxious recently about having conversations with people and I never felt this way last year so I don't know where this anxiety has come from.
My OCD fixates on contamination, the need to feel clean and doing certain rituals to stop bad things happening, maybe saying sorry is now one of them?
I don't want this to ruin my friendships though, as it might make people think I am weird or something.
I just want the anxiety that is centered around conversations to go away, I guess it boils down to my insecurity or something. I haven't been feeling great recently. I analyze every little thing about what I say and what people say.
My facial ticks have come back a lot more recently and I am really worried about people at work noticing and thinking I am weird. I have to do them in sets of 4 and I have been washing my hands a lot at work too.
I am thinking once the fluoxetine kicks in I will be fine, but then how can the people I constantly used to apologize too not think I am weird or needy? I can't reverse any of it. If I apologize again it would make me look worse and probably irritate my friends even more and I don't want to do that.
I am going round in circles with this, so if anyone can offer me some advice that would be much appreciated.
Thank you :original:

"Hi
I have a few childhood and schoolfriends on Facebook in my friends list. But there is one friend who I did hang out with as a teenager for a number of years. We used to climb trees together and go for bikerides but he could be 2 faced to me and his other friends as well. Especially around a crowd. I had this niggling underlying thought he was using me as a kid as I lived in a bigger house. But we did have good times and he used to sleep round mine, we'd watch videos until late and play computer games. He did encourage me to smoke and even try weed once, of which i did take one puff. Never again though. One time my grandfather died and I arranged to meet up with this friend that evening at the top of my lane but he did not turn up or ring beforehand as his older half sister had boyfriend trouble. It was January and the middle of winter. He did meet up the next day though to say he had personal family issues regarding his sister and her bf. We hung out then. That year he moved 5 miles away and I was at college and he dropped out of college and got a job with his dad and got a girlfriend. We lost contact.
He joined Facebook a while ago and usually I was not worried that we were now just former friends but I saw his profile the other day and the old friend memories came flooding back. I have had these ruminations before. I have had a temptation to drop him a line. His account name is now that of him and his new wife. So a shared account. We have not spoken for 15 years apart from a brief meet in a pub 10 years ago when he was with his friends and I was with some other old friends. I do worry that if I do drop him a line and get no answer and he has logged on since, that I will never see the old friend memories in the same light again.
Mum said that it may not be anything personal if he does not answer, as you naturally drifted apart years ago and have moved on. She has had the same with her old schoolfriends and childhood friends. She used to play with her cousins as a kid and lost contact years ago.
One comfort is another friend who he lived in the same street with for years and was good friends with is not on his friend list and never has been, nor is he friends with that former friends brother. I did look once or twice. I am friends with that brother, a lifelong friend of my brother and me.

"I am feeling really down today. I've been going reasonably okay recently (apart from the lack of worries increasing my fears that I don't have OCD :dry: ). But yesterday at school I had a massive trigger. During morning registration our form tutor gave out letters that had been issued by the Health Protection Agency about an outbreak of gastroenteritis in the school. The letter basically said what symptoms we should look out for and gave advice about making sure we wash our hands properly etc etc.
And I know its not like a life threatening illness or anything but I can't get it out of my head! I've always had a little trouble using the toilets at school because they're not the cleanest of places but now its near impossible to go in (if I'm honest the only reason I have been going in is because its the only place with sinks that I can use at anytime) when I do go in I'm finding myself washing my hands over and over. Last time I went to the toilets today I even had to wipe down the door handle with an antibacterial wipe before going back and washing my hands for a third time then opening the door with a tissue in my hand anyway (luckily no one was around to witness me doing this).
I've tried to resist doing this but I can't stand how my hands feel after I touch something that feels """"""""infected"""""""". The best I can do is make myself wait a little bit before going to find somewhere to wash them. Then once I've washed my hands it doesn't take long for me to accidentally touch something that I shouldn't. All of my books and stationary feels infected and I can barely think about touching door handles, taps, chairs, keyboards, desks or just about anything else people may have been near. It's been getting worse and worse and worse!
I get a bit of a break when I get home in the evenings but before school and all day it's there and I'm analysing everything and trying to find ways to avoid touching things (I even considered going and asking the science department if I could have a pair of their disposable rubber gloves).
I hate it and I can't make it stop! I don't want to have to worry about everything I go near just because I might get ill or accidentally pass it on to someone else.

"I visited the GP yesterday and sit on a chair in her office while we were discussing my medication. My main OCD theme is contamination, and using that chair has been a massive trigger since yesterday. I can't stop thinking of how many SICK people have used that chair before me, how many GERMS there were that I've brought back into my house...
I'm meeting a friend later this evening. The constant thought in my mind is: """"""""I'm not wearing the same jacket I was wearing yesterday, it just has so many germs on it. I'm not taking the same bag either.""""""""
Deep down, I know what I am supposed to do. But how do I bring myself to do it??

"I first got OCD seven years ago and with the support of my family, medication and CBT I was able to get over it and until recently I had no problems at all. (Good times)
Then in December 2010 I started to worry about the flu going around as I have two young kids and I started to think about what we were doing as a family and started to use hand gel as a precaution.
Somehow I let my OCD spiral out of control and its back and controlling my life again, the strange thing is im not worried about the flu and its gone back to my contamination fear of blood.
Everything I seem to do i worried about blood as my hands are so dry and they are cracking and bleeding, I know I need to stop washing my hands but its hard.
I have been back to the doctors and have started to take medication again and i have my first appointment with the CBT in 2 days.
I know i have been weak and let it go to far and need to take control again.
Any advice would be appreciated. Thanks","['fear', 'bleeding', 'washing hands', 'OCD', 'Medication']",[],"['bleeding', 'washing hands', 'fear', 'Medication', 'OCD']",,1.0,,,
"Hi, all! :original:
I wonder whether it makes any difference what the """"""""content"""""""" or """"""""theme"""""""" of your contamination OCD is to how hard it is to conquer.
My fear is chemicals like battery acid and white spirit. I'm afraid of getting it on my stuff (plastic stuff like CDs etc - which makes me feel guilty and ashamed as it might make me seem materialistic, which I'm really not) and damaging them. Completely destroying them, in fact.
I know it's irrational, but I have the nagging feeling that it's not completely unreasonable, as these chemicals can cause damage and corrosive burns to objects, as well as people's flesh in the case of strong acid.
Due to this possibility, I believe this is the reason as to why I've had this type of OCD so long and why I can't shake it off.

"Hi,
Sorry for posting what seems like a silly question, but I need some advice because I'm having a problem deciding what is a normal response to a problem and how much my thinking is being influenced by OCD.
  My contamination OCD is centred around the fear that I've contaminated my carpets, basically by not keeping my bathroom/toilets clean in the past, and this has spread around my house. I've been making slow progress with ERP around the house, and I'm just starting the toughest exposures so far which is touching the carpet without washing my hands. It's taken me about a year and a half to build up to this, which is way too long, but I've finally got there.
  The problem is that I've had mice in my house during that time (and on previous occasions) so there are mouse droppings around the house - not so many that you'd immediately notice them, but they are there. I don't think I have mice at the moment as I got the pest controllers in, but you never know as they are sneaky little things and quite good at hiding!
  Anyway, the problem is I don't know what a normal response to this would be as I tidy up my house from the neglect it's had due to my OCD (I haven't vacuumed my carpets for years for fear of spreading germs). I could steam clean my carpets, but I fear that this would be an excuse for my OCD as I've been resisting doing it as a response to my contamination fears (I bought a steam cleaner when I thought I had contaminated my carpets, but before I knew it was OCD). Or I could pick up the droppings (with gloves on) as I find them and spray that small area with disinfectant, but not worry about any contamination spreading further. Or I could just vacuum as normal and not worry about it at all. But I'm worried that this is less than a normal person would do, for example I know my family use disinfectant when cleaning up if their pets make a mess.
  Sorry for the long post but I'm struggling to remember what a normal person would do in this circumstance. I don't want to give in to my OCD as this would feel like a step backwards. On the other hand I don't want to do something that a normal person would regard as dirty.

"Hi All.
Haven't been around for a while, as i am working in another country, and that,s where my current problem has reared its ugly head.
Ok so i was diagnosed with pure O some time ago now,and i am pretty ok dealing with it and know when an episode is on its way.
but this one has hit me and because i never had this kind of doubt or fear before, its quite scary. The trigger is basically as i said i am working away, and this idiot neighbour has had an argument with my wife. which i hasten to add has been reported to police and they are now involved.
So one of my ocd triggers is stress, and well this has not helped me at all and i am really concerned what's going on at home.
now a new and totally new thought and fear rumination has started for me, after visiting a dentist here. well lets just say from the outside the place looked modern and ok and well clean i guess. but inside it was kinda of not the same as the uk. and i felt a little uneasy. i had a really bad toothache and didnt think twice about getting it seen too. anyway i was asking questions like is stuff sterile and things like that. Anyway during the treatment my Gums started to bleed quite badly and i was given a swab to place in my mouth etc.
Now thats when its all started for me, as during the treatment the dentist dissapears and i can only assume went to toilet. i have observed locals here, and when they use the toilet etc they never wash their hands.
I am now in a mindfield of negative thoughts, This dentists equipment maybe wasnt sterilised maybe she didnt wash her hands. I had no googles on when treatment was taking place. what if she had someone in before me with Aids of Hepatitis or TB or something.
As you can see although i can try to rationalise there are to many what ifs
Some advice please from someone would be good, not reassuarance
Cheers

"I have had an intense fear of contaminating others for the past year now. In the midst of traveling my anxiety has peaked and it's become so much worse. Because now when I feel I am carrying some disease somehow, I then have to be in an enclosed space with many other travelers.
The other day my scarf brushed against a ledge where many pigeons were hanging around. I then felt like my scarf was now definitely contaminated with whatever pigeons or pigeon poop may carry. I didn't throw it out, though I kind of regret that, but I was nervous about it touching things on the train. I've washed it twice now. And today I touched a slug by accident, and read that sometimes slugs can have parasites, so now I'm worried about whatever I've touched since, despite washing my hands when I went indoors.
Bottom line. I can't wrap my head around how every thing I read tells me of all the dangers of bacteria and viruses etc, how they can stay on objects and clothing, yet people tell you not to worry. And I know that if things were really that dangerous everyone would be sick. But how is it that everyone isn't sick?!
I can't seem to forgive myself for what I might have transmitted.

"I have this contamination fear with chemicals. Yesterday, my dad was spraying grafititi remover to get rid of all the spilled paint in my backyard. He didn't use gloves and I was afraid that he might have got some chemicals from the grafititi remover on his hands. I started to clean everything that I thought he touched with soap and water such as the doorknobs to the back yard, the knobs to the kitchen sink and bathroom sink, etc. It is really tiring. Then I put my dog behind a fence so that my dog wouldn't walk all over the chemicals that just been sprayed on the ground because im afraid he might step on those chemicals and contaminate the whole back yard and my house (if i let him inside). And the reason why my dad was using the grafiti remover to remove the paint on the floor was because I asked him to. I was scared my dog might lick the paint  and get sick even though it already dried up. Now my dog is still  locked behind the fence (he still has lots of room to run, I have a big backyard), and I'm still afraid to open the fence to give him access to the whole backyard because I'm scared that he might step on the chemicals from the grafiti remover or he might lick it and get sick, even though it probably dried up by now (its been one day). 
Right now, because I started cleaning and scrubbing the doorknobs and washing my hands every time i think I touched an object that has been contaminated, I feel really anxious and I'm in a hyper-vigilant mode. I notice I'm being extra cautious not to touch anything that I think my dad might have touched after he used the Grafiti remover, which makes me feel really anxious and tired, because it's like I have to be extra careful and pay extra attention to what I touch, in fear that I might contaminate my hands. It's really messing up my motor functions. Whenever I try to do something with my hands, like for example taking money out of my wallet to pay for a purchase, I notice I do it very slowly and cautiously like I'm being extra careful not to get contaminated. It's like I'm already in that """"""""cautious mode"""""""" and its affecting my ability to perform simple tasks. It's affecting me so much that when I am at home, I pretty much avoid touching anything that I think my dad touched which makes me freeze up and I can't do anything productive in fear that I might contaminate my surroundings. I read on the warning label of the grafititi remover that it says the chemicals in there can absorb through the skin which is harmful. That's one reason why I'm really scared I might contaminate myself and my surrounding. But I keep telling myself that the chemicals from the grafititi remover is probably dried up by now and it can cause no harm. But even though I keep telling myself that, I keep on doubting and I keep on avoiding touching certain objects and after I touch an object that I think is contaminated with the grafiti remover, I also resort to washing my hands right after. I know I probably shouldn't do this but I just can't help it

"Hi all,
Sorry to be seeking more advice but I really need help. My biggest problem at the moment is worrying about contamination. It's semen that's my big fear. I imagine coming into contact with it (my own and strangers) and then I worry that I'm going around contaminating everything I touch. I imagine getting it on towels, food, possessions etc etc. It's more or less constantly on my mind. Within seconds of washing my hands I become convinced I've handled either my own or someone else's semen. I used to think that it was Aids I was worrying about but I'm not sure that it is. I just find the substance disgusting and I can't stand feeling that things might be contaminated with it. It's really taking over my life. I can't do simple tasks such as cooking a meal, doing the dishes, handling my possessions etc. as every thing I touch becomes contaminated and needs to be cleaned. In case you're wondering, that includes cleaning my laptop. I've been fairly stable (albeit critical!) for a few years but I really need to find a way to actually beat this dreadful illness. I only see a psychiatrist about 20 minutes every 3 months and there's no longer any suggestion of more CBT (it was a waste of time anyway) so it looks like I'm on my own. I just can't seem to find a way to decide whether the contamination is real or just in my head so I can't say """"""""that's just a thought so it's ocd that's causing me to worry"""""""" as I don't know that it's just a thought in the first place! Am I making any sense? Can anyone advise me as to what to do?

"I have contamination issues, esp. as regards semen, which started as as a result of nocturnal emmissions, from around age 15. I am now 20, and
the problem has not stopped. Normally, my OCD is quite manageable, and it does not bother me especially. However, it does spike and when it does, it is quite debilitating. Recently, what has bothered me is that I used to be more careless. Basically, it is because I used to use a towel after using the bath (normal, of course), even after emission,and it concern me that semen particles in the water would have been wiped onto the towel, which would be used later by others and I, and thus the contaminant would be transfered onto hands, thence onto other things around the house. To be clear, this is not any concern of making anyone ill, pregnant, &c.; it is the idea of it simply being there that bothers me. With these facts in mind, I have two questions:
a) Would semen particles (not only the sperm, but the other gubbins) actually be transfered from water to towel to hands to objects;
and b) Would semen particles be able to exist more than two years after the event of their 'arrival', especially being in small amounts and having been in water, or would the have broken down into the great molecular abyss, where they lose all aspects of their prior state (or something that sounds more scienc-ey)?","['OCD', 'object']",['spike'],"['spike', 'OCD', 'object']",1.0,,,,

Im after some advice-i have severe ocd , especially with contamination and responsibilty. Im having a horrible weekend and just wanted some advice. Has anyone here managed to decrease the amount of soap they use-my use is astronomical at the moment-its costing me an arm and a leg and i feel like an addict always searching to go and buy some more. Well today ive gone through 4 bottles, i have the smallest amount left until i can go out tomorrow and buy some. I also struggle with accepting that the soap isn't contaminated so i have thrown out 3 full bottles today as they didn't feel right. I am literally washing my hands away and i know there is no miracle way to just stop but was hoping someone here may have been through this too and can help?

"I am totally wiped out with anxiety and exuastion right now. I went into London today with my best friend to see a art house movie. Was great but had ALOT of themes that triggerd me and my friend (has ocd also)
We both left and discussed how thought provoking the movie was and had a glass of wine. Just as i was relaxing i picked up the drinks menu and it had some red thick blobs over it. My thumb went straight on it and i thought i was going to combust. My body went on fire and i went dizzy and tingly. Never had this in public
Straight away i thought it was blood, and i have a sore thumb nail aswell so that made it worse. I tried to be rational and said to my friend """"""""is that ketchup"""""""" he knew where i was going, i looked possessed. I said would u touch it, and he asked would it make me feel better if he did.
I said i really dont know, He had his thumb on it but i dont think he realised and i am not sure if he did touch it in the end.
So that was the first freak out that totally ruined my mood after that cos thats all i could think about. Then walking back to the station i was bursting for the loo, so i ducked into the gay bar which is famous for being a sleeze pit pick up joint. Looked empty so i thought i was ok
Went to the loo and it was like a dark room, men hanging around and 1 guy who was obv on drugs flew into my face and almost tried to kiss me or head butt me. Was hanging around the 1 and only cubicle and this guy was standing in there with him.
Was sooo weird for this to happen during day time hours. i was bustin to go so i waited for them to leave. As soon as i got in there it looked like there was semen all over the floor and in the toilet bowl.i freaked out and opened the door by the top and ran out.
my friend was worried as i was ages, and i grabbed my bag which has my anti bac hand lotion in it. So now im double paniced. Over the menu and if i picked up something in the loo. I really do think i am at risk. I have tried to calm down and went for a walk around london but cant relax.
It has been a terrible few days and i think i should have just stayed in

"Does anyone else suffer with contamination ocd that isn’t linked to a particular feared outcome? I’m not afraid I’ll get I’ll or die, I’m not worried I’ll infect others or feel responsible for others. I just can’t tolerate feeling contaminated. I think my ocd stems from social anxiety and wanting to be perfect and fit in. My family all have traits of ocd so I pre-disposed to it and I guess I started doing the rituals to keep me safe. I’ve done it from an early age (mostly when I’d had to use a public toilet) but one of the first real memories I have is when I was 14 I was sick in the middle of the night. Suddenly my whole room was contaminated due to touching things when I had been sick (by tv remote for example) and I really struggled to feel like it was all clean again. I also avoid decontaminating things for fear that the dirt will spread all over me. I basically felt consumed by the dirt, couldn’t relax and couldn’t do anything about it without contaminating myself more (by cleaning). 
  This is basically how I always feel about contamination. My home is like a protective box around me (especially my bed) and the only place I can relax. Therefore it needs to be clean. Yet my husband does the cleaning as I know I’ll never be able to stop cleaning and I’ll spend hours in the shower after. I get trapped between feeling contaminated but not able to do anything about it. I feel uncomfortable, dirty and unable to relax. But I don’t really think I have a particular feared outcome. It’s for that reason that I haven’t really been able to apply cbt techniques to it. All therapists think I’m afraid of germs (I use the word dirt instead to differentiate it) and getting sick or making someone else sick. But it’s not that. Anyone else like this?

"I have contamination ocd and I have a lot of anxiety about touching or being exposed to meth residue. I read on the website www.methinyourhouse.com that when people smoke meth, the vapor that they blow out contains meth residue and this chemical residue sticks onto any surfaces and whoever touches those surfaces with their bare hands will absorb the meth residue through the skin and it  will get into their bloodstream and  they can experience the drug's effects. This is really scary to me because meth is such a nasty drug that can damage the body and mind and I wouldn't want to be exposed to any of it's residue. This is why companies have meth clean up crews that wear hazmat suits before they enter a meth contaminated building where it's been cooked or where the meth heads hang out at. They wear the hazmat suits to avoid meth contamination which makes me think that meth residue exposure is a real thing. 
I know 2 friends who smoke meth (i don't talk to them anymore) and both of them were in my car. The first friend was in the passenger seat. He's a regular meth user and I remember I had to give him a ride somewhere one time and then the thought struck me. He smokes meth so his hands are probably contaminated with meth residue and his clothes are probably contaminated with meth residue too since he smokes it and the vapor probably gets all over his body and clothes. He was sitting in the passenger seat and now I been completely AVOIDING touching the passenger seat and the passenger door and basically anything that he touched in my car, I avoid touching it because i'm scared that the meth residue will get absorbed through my skin. 
  I have another friend that smokes meth on a regular basis too and he was in the back seat of my car, laying down, so his whole body was covering the whole back seat of my car. His clothes are probably contaminated with meth residue too so now I completely avoid touching or having contact with the backseat of my car.
  Here's the thing that frustrates me the most. Not only am I scared of touching the passenger seat and the backseat, but I'm also scared of leaving my stuff on there. For example, I go to college and whenever I drive to school I would NEVER leave my backpack on the passenger seat or the back seat of my car. I would leave my backpack lying on my lap, in the drivers seat while i'm driving. I know it's really weird and awkward. But I'm afraid that if I leave my backpack on the passenger seat or the back seat, the meth residue might transfer from the passenger seats and backseat to my backpack. And since I touch my backpack every time I need to take out my books, binder or school supplies, I am afraid of contaminating those objects too. I'm also afraid of contaminating my steering wheel and basically everything that I touch, I'm afraid of contaminating it with meth residue which is why I avoid touching anything that my meth head friends touched or i avoid putting my things on anything that my meth head friends touched. 
  I mean, meth residue is a real thing, I bet if I walked into a crack house and touched the door knobs I would feel some kind of drug effect. I even shook hands with one of my friend who smokes meth and I remember I shook his hands right after he did it and I SWEAR I FELT SOMETHING, like a head change. I felt more alert and my body felt really hot and my ears started getting red and I just felt weird, and it happened shortly after I shook his hands and he just finished doing meth. So I think there is some truth to meth residue being a hazard. 
  The worst part is that I don't know if it is irrational or rational, like for example when I avoid leaving my backpack on the passenger seat or the backseat where my meth head friends sat because i'm afraid of contaminating my backpack and everything else. What should I do? Should I just face my fear and leave my backpack on the passenger seat and backseat? Or should I  go one step above and touch the passenger seat and backseat and touch everything that my meth head friends touched? If i do this, and meth gets into my body, I'm afraid it might do some damage to my body and brain. I can't afford to lose brain cells by being exposed to these toxic chemicals..I get so paranoid after I touch something that I think has meth on it and then I get anxious and then I'm not able to concentrate or do well in my school work and I start thinking that maybe it's the meth residue that is causing me problems in doing school work when in reality it could just be anxiety..? (or could be the meth)
And I'm not only afraid of touching things that are exposed to meth, i'm also afraid of touching things that I think has the drug LSD on it, as LSD can get absorbed into the bloodstream through the skin too. Basically any drug or chemical that can get absorbed through the skin and get into the bloodstream, I tend to avoid touching it, it's not limited to just meth or LSD. 
  After I touch something that I think has meth residue or LSD residue on it, I wash my hands vigorously with warm water and sometimes I go above and beyond and wipe my steering wheels, car door knob, buttons on the car radio, etc. as i'm afraid to contaminate other things. I use soap and water when I """"""""decontaminate"""""""" these objects and it's really exhausting. I feel like it would be easier if I just decided, you know what, i'm just going to touch everything that I think has drug residue on it and touch everything else and contaminate everything and just accept the anxiety and not do anything about it. That way I just have to deal with the anxiety of it, instead of dealing with the  cleaning, wiping, washing hands repeatedly, and  decontaminating things which is really exhausting. But I just hate the fact that after I touch something that I think has meth residue or drug residue on it, I get really paranoid and feel like I can't think clearly and it affects concentration in my school work and I start thinking that it's the drug residue having a negative effect on my cognition. This is a major reason why I avoid it because I think it has some kind of effect on my brain, more specifically my cognition and intelligence. I guess I'm afraid of losing brain cells by being exposed to these toxic residue.
Please help me i'm really not sure what to do. Should I just have my whole car cleaned or should I just let go and not care and just touch everything in my car even though it might have meth residue  and other drug residue on it?","['OCD', 'site', 'Thought', 'fear', 'washing hands', 'object', 'anxiety', 'anxiety']",['irrational'],"['anxiety', 'washing hands', 'site', 'object', 'fear', 'Thought', 'irrational', 'OCD']",,1.0,,,
"Hello, how is everyone doing? 
I want to talk about two types of OCD that I have. It's been really hard lately and the symptoms have been a little unbearable. Please bear with me, this will be a long post.
I have contamination OCD and it's pretty severe. I would be afraid of touching household chemicals or any kind of chemicals in fear that if I get it on my hands, I might contaminate my surroundings and I might touch other parts of my body such as my face, eyes, genitals or mouth incidentally.  And it's not just chemicals, it's any kind of substance that I perceive as a potential danger. For example, the other day when I spilled chocolate ice cream on my hands while I was driving, I was really careful not to touch my steering wheel with the hand that has chocolate on it. My hand was really sticky and I felt a strong urge to wash it right away, so while I was driving, I stopped at a nearby restaurant just to wash my hands so that I wouldn't contaminate my steering wheel. My ocd thought was that if I had chocolate on my hands and I touch my steering wheel with it, every time I touch the steering wheel, my hands will be contaminated again because I didn't clean the steering wheel, which makes me have a strong urge to clean the steering wheel too. 
Another example of how this greatly affects my every day life is that I dread going to the gas station to pump gas. it REALLY triggers my ocd when I have to pump gas. My OCD makes me think that I have to be very cautious and careful when pumping gas because after I am done pumping gas and I take the gas pump out of my gas tank, there is always some gas that leaks out of the gas pump and I have to be very careful not to accidentally spill any gas on me while I'm putting the pump back. I notice the gas usually leaks out of the pump and is spilled on the ground which gives me A LOT of anxiety because I don't want to step on the spilled gas and have it all over my shoes and then I might contaminate my house with gas when I walk in my house with shoes on. That is why I always avoid stepping on any wet spots on the ground at the gas station.  I'm also very careful not to spill any gas on the exterior of my car while taking out the pump so that I don't touch it by accident later on. 
I'm also very very careful not to touch the tube thing that is connected to the pump because my ocd makes me think that there might be gas spilled on the tube thing. Pretty much every time I go to pump gas, it feels like such a burden and I have to wash my hands EVERY time I pump gas. If the pump feels wet when I'm touching it, automatically I would think that it's GAS when really it could be water (the previous person that used the pump could of had wet hands?). So every time I pump gas, I always do everything SLOWLY and hyper-vigilantly so that I don't spill any gas on me or step on any gas. 
The reason why I'm so afraid of being contaminated with gas is because it causes cancer and not only that, to me, it seems like a dangerous substance if it were to be spilled on any part of your body or skin. My OCD makes me think that if I have some gas or gas residue on my hands and I rub my eyes, Or I bite my nails,  Or I scratch my jewels, I would think that the gas would get onto those body parts and do some serious damage, so I end up washing my hands with soap thoroughly every time I pump gas. And if the gas station that I'm at doesn't have a restroom, I would drive to a nearby restaurant to use the restroom so I can wash my hands. And when I'm driving to a nearby restaurant, I only use one hand to control the steering wheel and I don't touch the steering wheel with the hand that I use to pump gas until I have washed it. 
Now I'm always hyper-vigilant of everything that I'm about to touch and I notice lately I'm hyper vigilant in general and just can't seem to relax. 
Now here's reading OCD.
I have reading OCD , which is a type of ocd that makes me feel like I don't understand what I just read so I end up rereading the whole thing again and again until I feel like I understand it. My OCD makes me feel like I have to understand EVERY word and EVERY sentence when I read it. I notice this type of OCD is usually triggered when I'm reading school material or any material that is a major significance to me. School material usually brings me a lot of anxiety because it's hard and my OCD makes me try really hard to understand the material so as a result, I end up rereading many times. This OCD seems very hard to beat, especially when it has to do with school material because if the material is hard, I have to genuinely re-read it in order to understand it but my OCD makes me anxious whenever I'm reading the school material and I always have the feeling that I HAVE to understand everything that I read, which makes it even harder to understand. I really don't know what to do with this type of OCD. It is like after I read something, I doubt my understanding of what I just read. I reread again, to achieve the feeling of """"""""getting it"""""""" or """"""""understanding it"""""""" but as I re-read it again, I get the feeling that I didn't understand it completely so I re-read it again, and again and again until it feels """"""""right"""""""" or until it feels like I get it. This OCD also ruins the flow of reading. For example, when I'm reading a sentence in a paragraph, if my OCD makes me feel like I don't understand the sentence, I would re-read the sentence over and over again until I get the feeling that I understand it and then I would move on to the next sentence and by then I would lose my focus because I was so fixated on understanding the first sentence. This ruins the """"""""flow"""""""" of my reading and it makes understanding a lot harder and feels like I can't get into the """"""""zone"""""""" or get into the material. 
Lastly, I don't know if this is OCD or an attention problem, but when I read something, sometimes it feels like it just doesn't register in my brain. Like I would be reading it in my head but it doesn't seem to click, which makes me read it over again. I would read the sentence word for word in my head but it doesn't click. It is like I'm reading just as an action of reading but not understanding it, if that makes sense. Maybe it has to do with me feeling anxious whenever I'm reading and that anxious feeling distracts me from understanding? I don't know. 
I can see this OCD being very problematic when I go to university...
Sorry for the long post, I just been struggling so much with these two types of OCD, would really appreciate your advices and opinions on how to get over these two type of OCD.

"I feel like my contamination OCD theme comes up several times a week so that I rarely feel free of it and it's exhausting. And feels like a real concern most of the time. Although I got over a couple of things fairly easily recently but other times it feels more real and harder to ignore. Sometime it involves worrying about others too. I'm just venting. Is venting helpful or counterproductive or a form of ruminating? Thanks!

"Hi all...
I have problem with contamination OCD.
If I go to the toilet while I am work, I feel dirty. If I was at home, I would jump straight into the bath afterwards. When I get home, I will get my wife to aid my OCD by asking her to clean the surfaces which I walked on when I came home. I will then jump into the bath. My wife will take my clothes downstairs. The thought of my clothes being dirty is so strong that I cant help but think this contamination will then go on my wife. She does wash her hands after, but my problem is I imagine sprinkles of faces, hair etc falling off of my clothes.
This seriously gets so out of control to the point where I cannot function. Please could somebody give me some perspective on this. I already know that a person without OCD wouldn't worry about the things that I am worrying about, but I can't help but feel responsible for the stuff that is happening. I feel that it is my responsibility to wash my hands properly but I feel I don't know how to no more. I also feel it is my responsibility to wipe properly after going to the toilet, but again I feel I don't know how to any more.
I have already contaminated my workplace to the point of no return, so everytime I go home, I bring that with me which is why I need to clean everything. Even if I avoid going to the toilet at work that day, I still feel so anxious when I get home because of what has happened at work in the past. This I can't clean so I just carry on with the rituals.
Can anyone give me some advice please..I am not asking for reassurance, just want perspective and advice on my situation, perhaps a message from someone who may also be going through the same thing and points or tips on getting over this.
Thanks in advance everyone.","['Thought', 'fall', 'Rituals', 'OCD', 'toilet']",[],"['fall', 'Thought', 'Rituals', 'toilet', 'OCD']",,1.0,,,
"I was walking to station other day on way to work and kids to school and got worried bottom of my shoes weren't clean, was just an ocd worry.
Anyway lady walks past and says have you got dog poo on your shoes and hands me a packet of baby wipes with 3 wipes in. I've since been completely panicked about the packet of wipes she gave me. I threw the wipes away and gelled my hands with hand gel and gelled a bit of my coat. There was nothing on the wipe packet or the wipes visible.
On the way to work I bought a packet of antibacterial wipes and wiped myself and clothes with them before I arrived at work.
I washed all my clothes at home.
I'm not touching anything at home and washing all my clothes and bathing every night when I get it.
I'm worried what if she had cleaned dog poo off her shoes with them, they are not even anti bacterial. What if she touched the other wipes after doing this? What if she didn't wash her hands? She looked clean, there was nothing visible on the wipes but I can't stop thinking about this. Would people normally wipe their shoe with a baby wipe in public and if say you did that would you wash your hands after? Would you touch other wipes before washing your hands? Anyone know what's normal? if I anti bacterial wiped everything would that be enough anyway and can I stop all the washing.
Sorry I just really stressed at the moment. My MIL looks like she might have cancer and my DH has been violent is the past but is currently fine but I'm scared this will tip him over.

"hey ocduk, i just wanted to know if anyone else out there is or has suffered this and if they can give me any words of encouragment. My ocd started when I was little and it was based around illness causing vomitting. I always thought i was just overly cautious and a germaphobe, but as i went from kid to teen, the fears became more irrational, leading to a couple periods where i would starve myself for months at a time. My ocd waxed and waned, the primary beginning fear was contamination, when i was in highschool i became scared of my drinks being spiked, then food, etc. then it changed to intrusive harm thoughts. it's been a really tough journey, but im still fighting and i wont give up. Right now my contamination fears are off the charts, it has lead me back to starving myself and ive lost over 100lbs. My family came for a bit of an intervention a few days ago and tried to admit me to the hospital for refeeding but i broke down and basically yelled at the psychiatrist that i didn't want to be admitted. I've been granted a week to prove that i will start eating every day and start my prozac again, if i can't manage it then i have to be admitted. I'm scared and I've lost all joy in food. Every item of food seems contaminated to me, and everyday i convince myself im going to be sick. It is incredibly depressing and i hate feeling like this. I hate looking at myself in the mirror, or seeing people i havent seen in awhile as ive lost so so much weight that i look unwell or addicted to drugs i just want to stop feeling like absolutely everything will make me sick, or avoiding going out to do things because i might get sick. I think about what would happen if i actually got sick, and i know i would hate it but after the initial anxiety would dissapate, i would just let nature run it's course, be strong and it would just be a nuissance. I was sick for almost 2 trimesters of my pregnancy, i threw up a lot, as well as during labor and once in public and i was ok! it wasn't fun and i didnt like it, but it wasnt as terrible as my ocd makes it out to be. yet i still end up here, i think it has more to do wih control and uncertainty. I can't predict when i will be sick so therfore i have to remain vigilant and if it happens i can't do anything to really stop it. Couple that with the intense negative thinking and i never catch a break. My day is spent thinking about when ill be sick, foods that might make me sick, getting sick because of karma (magical thinking) and what to do if i get sick in public. I don't know how to be ok with food anymore, it's like its an enemy to me now but i have no choice but to eat it. How can I get through this My body is depleting because of how long i starved myself. I have no energy, i feel grouchy all the time, anxious, my head feels foggy 24/7, ive actually started growing lanugo hair on my face. Now that im trying to eat, my digestive system doesnt know how to deal with it so i get gassy and bloated which in turn makes me think im sick. it just never ends, i just want to be better. does anyone else know what this is like how can i get through this! i need some good affirmations or some fighting words!

"It has been a long time since I posted on a forum about this. But I remember ocdforums being a great help years ago so here I am back again.
I wish I could say I was away in some sort of freedom from OCD but the truth is not that optimistic. In a lot of ways it's worse. A few things have happened that only exacerbated the symptoms to the point where I know I have to do something but feel extremely discouraged. Job loss a couple of years ago, some poor career decisions, and I wound up almost losing everything...
That said, I got a job about a year ago and it has caused me a lot of stress even if it does pay the bills. I have contamination OCD and there are things at work that are massive stressors for me.
One is gasoline. I fix computers as a career. But somehow I managed to find a job where we have cans of gasoline in the warehouse that worry me constantly.
The other is the drive. I feel like my nerves are shot by the time I arrive. It is in an industrial area and bus service is terrible to it, plus I am expected to drive to customer sites so I need to drive anyway.
And the hygiene of others is getting to me. My little corner of cubicle hell is right by the toilets and I hear most people do their business and leave without washing their hands. I have to touch these peoples keyboards! Every day!
And we had an employee with terrible personal hygiene. I feel awful for criticizing or talking about this person but they rarely washed their hair and the signs of lacking personal hygiene were obvious. I had to reassign their phone to someone who was also concerned it had belonged to this person. So I am not the only one.
I feel ashamed of being so critical of another person like that. But I can't seem to shake the fears.
All of these things are just the work issues. I have other things I am dealing with as well. My OCD is affecting my relationship with someone I love, with my family, my home life. I feel depressed and find it hard to be optimistic.
So I have been really trying to figure out what fears are rational and what fears aren't. The gasoline one to me is completely rational. But even after filling my car, why am I the only one who washes his hands at the filling station before I get back in my car? Is gasoline and the lack of care equivalent to the lead plumbing of the Romans? I feel so alone.
I've applied for other jobs but so far no results.","['toilet', 'washing hands', 'talking', 'shame', 'fear', 'flatulence', 'OCD', 'symptom', 'site']",[],"['talking', 'flatulence', 'washing hands', 'site', 'fear', 'toilet', 'shame', 'symptom', 'OCD']",,1.0,,,

"Hi everyone
Have not posted on here for a while but feel I need to now. For those who have not read my posts before I have contamination ocd relating to bodily fluids, urine, poo and vomitand touching my genitial region.
Am really struggling with my ocd at the moment I constantly feel contaminated/dirty and these thoughts only increase every time I use the toilet. Have been doing ERP but I feel its not working for me. I'm struggling to find a good therapist for cbt and I've been hospitilized twice with my condition and things are so bad at the moment that I'm considering going again
I find of late that my rituals have increased (eventhough they were always there) for example handwashing is longer and also I spend at least an hour having a shower every day but not feeling any cleaner once I leave it and also craving a shower after I use the toilet esp when I have a bowel movement. Showers are so stressful I just can't stop washing and I don't want it to get longer.even getting dress each day is a struggle. Having said that I managed to not have a shower for the first time in ages this morning.Avoidance is a big problem for me too I'm restricting what I eat to cut out the frequency of bowel movements as I cannot cope with the anxiety.

"Hello,
I'll try & keep this as brief as possible & would really appreciate your feedback on my situation as I've never spoken to anyone else with OCD about it. I've been suffering from cocd for about a year now. I'm on the waiting list for CBT on the NHS & have been for most of this year now I think. I've only told my mum & two of my closest friends who I trust as frankly I find it embarrassing. They are supportive & reassure me that I'm not mad!
My OCD has developed rapidly whilst living with a close friend who is a lovely person but has issues with depression & is, to be frank, a lazy slob with very little pride. We live in quite a large house & our landlady (his mother) won't hear of us getting a cleaner as she thinks he should clean the house himself. The problem is he doesn't because he's lazy & it doesn't bother him. This is a problem for me because I work full time (unlike him), long hours & have to commute two hours a day to & from London so have very little time & with being ill too (see below) am often exhausted. I went through the phase of trying to get him to help me clean but it's pointless because he doesn't do it properly. Cleaning the fridge results in a fridge still covered with food so I end up having to do it myself anyway. He's not malicious just useless! To add to this he also claims to have a strong immune system & so, OCD aside, has what I would consider to be below acceptable hygiene standards. I know he doesn't always wash his hands after going to the loo (& I don't mean for a pee) & doesn't wash his hands when taking out rubbish. As a result I hardly touch anything in our house & get through boxes of tissues from touching light switches, door handles etc He also gets mess on the toilet seat. Work has been ridiculous these last few months & the state of the house has gotten to a point where it makes my skin crawl. Along with the tissues I get through tons of hand soap through repeated hand washing. I can clean the house with gloves on but it takes me AGES to do it properly & I can never get around the whole place & spend half the time washing my hands. The floors get hoovered but I can't remember the last time I had time to wash the floors properly so Im half freaking out about them & it half justifies my behaviours. Our house is definitely where the OCD is at it's worst & I am trying to move to my own place ASAP as living in a house where you don't want to touch anything is time consuming, distressing & exhausting. Outside of the house I am generally OCD about floors now (unless they're clearly sparkling), the ones at work make me cringe as its an old building & we have mice, pavements- if anything falls I freak out in case of dog poo. Public transport makes me cringe as its filthy & I have to use it so much, always carry antibacterial wipes & don't touch anything. And public toilets/ cash points because they're grim obviously. I haven't told my housemate because I don't think he would understand or make me feel good about it. He's actually training to be a therapist but I think is one of those types doing it more for their own benefit, he makes a joke out of most serious things so I don't feel like I can talk to him. I'm going back to my parents a lot ATM as I feel so much more relaxed there, I still wash my hands a lot after using the loo & wouldn't touch the floors but generally I trust their standards of hygiene.
I'd be interested to hear from other people as it really gets me down sometimes, it's very tiring & I actually cried a couple of times when I went back to my house as it's so unbearable. I think moving & having a shoe free house will significantly improve my quality of life. At the moment everything feels contaminated & there are not enough hours or antibacterial wipes in the world!! I'm not sure even when I move though how I'll be able to start thinking 'normally' again about floors, shoe laces, washing, cash points etc :s","['depression', 'pride', 'Food', 'washing hands', 'outside', 'fall', 'interest', 'quality', 'toilet', 'OCD']",[],"['outside', 'quality', 'washing hands', 'pride', 'depression', 'interest', 'fall', 'toilet', 'Food', 'OCD']",,1.0,,,
"Just wondered whether anyone else with contamination OCD got to a stage when they become so tired/depressed/short of resources in fighting the minutiae of OCD germ battles that the fatigue caused their hygiene to plummet even beyond generally """"""""acceptable"""""""" as depression set in?
Right now, without going into details, I am personally the filthiest I have ever been, yet I wash my hands with the dedication of a classic sufferer because the energy to fight the macro level of basic hygiene war (daily showering, teeth brushing) has been sapped to the point where the idea of performing them sloppily is worse than not performing them at all..

"Hi...hope everyone's doing OK. I have a question...as ever...and wondered if anyone had any ideas. I don't quite know how to describe it but...here goes...
Basically, I don't feel like I have contamination OCD as I don't do loads of cleaning rituals. However, sometimes, say for example I've touched something with my hands and then touch something else. If the first thing I touched makes me think I should wash my hands and then I touch the second thing, I kind of have to give the second thing I touched what I can only describe as a really cursory wipe. The thing is, I may just quickly wipe it with my hand, (which I'll have washed by now,) but it's not even thorough and prolly a complete waste of time in terms of cleaning it. However, unless I do it it doesn't feel right. It can't be cos I'm a really hygenic person cos I don't scrub and scrub at something...it's more a case of touching it with a clean hand, (albeit it in a really scanty cleaning attempt,) to make me feel OK about touching it without a clean hand.
Does that make any sense? Does anyone else get anything similar? THanks for listening...take care, RachelZ","['hope', 'OCD', 'Rituals']",[],"['Rituals', 'hope', 'OCD']",,1.0,,,

"I hope this isn't taken the wrong way...
While I certainly have more issues with germs than the average person, I have never identified as having contamination as my OCD theme. My theme is harm.
As many of you know, I am a teacher. I'm surrounded by germs kids all day. I use a lot of antibacterial gel, and my students know that I'm a big fan of the """"""""air high-five"""""""" so that they don't have to touch me.
My home was my sanctuary as far as germs were considered. I didn't worry about my family's germs. However, there is a stomach bug making it's way through the house. Stomach bugs are just the worst. I am so paranoid about getting the big that I wash my hands numerous times an hour. My hands are cracked and painful - although some of that can be attributed to the cold Canadian winter.
I don't like this feeling. But I will be fine once the illness is gone. However, it made me think of all the people on here who suffer so greatly with contamination issues.

"Hi Everyone :original:
I'd just like to put my problem across and see if any one can relate to my OCD problem?.
I have been misunderstood alot of times by people, Doctor's, Therapist's etc. The thing is i'm pretty sure I have Contamination fears aswell as other Anxiety Disorder's, but the thing is my fear seems a little unusual and I find most people can not relate to my problem, it appears to some materialistic.
I'll explain why.
Most people say to me 'Nothing can hurt you' but it isn't me being hurt e.g poisoned, I don't have a fear of posioning e.g Blood, Aids etc. My problem is stains, which really sounds pathetic, as i'm bothered about them getting on Clothes my Material items, e.g appearing Materialistic which i'm not for a minute. I think alot of this may come from my Childhood when I really looked after stuff I had.
It's so hard to put into Words but I have problems if someone does a job I think is dirty it's like they are leaving deposits all over the house from their hands. An example of this is my Dad was Painting the Fences outside over the weekend, I was in complete Panic as I thought everything was going to become contaminated from stuff he touched in the House, even though he'd washed his hands properly outside, I find myself asking my Mum, who's used the sink, or touched the Kettle. I will avoid touching the kettle or washing my face if someone has used the items I feel are contaminated before me through fear i'll be spreading the Enviromental contaminant onto me and then my possesions. You see it's nothing to do with Posioning but me becoming conatminated with the substance on me, even though I know deep down there is no chance anything has got on me, i'm on the lookout for marks.
I think this is unusual and I haven't heard much talk on the Forum about this type of OCD, I feel abit unusual.
Because my Dad had washed his hands last night in the bathroom sink, just general washing, I seem to think the taps have bits of deposits left on them and have maybe splashed my toothbrush, so I avoid the taps and clean my toothbrush before using it. Like last night I got stuck in washing my hands, at first after washing them I touched the basin so had to do them again as I think the basin is unclean, then something didn't feel right so I had to do them again, it took me 8 times before getting into bed as I feared the imagined deposit would be on my hand and would go over my bed in my sleep.
I just can't get my head round it and wondered if anyone else goes through this?.

"Hi everyone,
Firstly I'd just like to thank everybody who replied to my earlier post ('Life is tough / handwashing') - I haven't got round to replying yet ...
I just came on to moan about germs today... I mean I was just sitting eating my dinner when my mum and dad came home from taking our dog for a walk, and I'd seen my mum touching the lead (which has been all these really dirty places) and then she just went straight outside and got the washing in, obviously touching it all . That's just so gross, I hated it, but I can't say anything because if I do we just end up arguing and everyone being cross with me just for pointing out general hygiene. And then she did actually wash her hands after she came in, but that's no good 'cause she's already contaminated stuff. So what's the point of her washing her hands at all if all she's going to do is touch stuff that's contaminated straight after she's washed them? I've seen the rest of my family do things like this as well - like just washing their hands after touching something dirty (like money) and then turning off the tap after with their hands, which surely would just make them contaminated again ? So why do they bother washing them at all? Now there's just so much that's contaminated I don't know where to start cleaning and actually there isn't much point of me cleaning things that they touch, 'cause they just make everything all dirty again .
Why can't other, so called 'normal' people see this? I wish they would just realise that germs do exist.

No event or person seems to be excluded from its grip anymore.

"Has anyone got any coping mechanisms for rumination/ways of tackling it. It's something that has been a feature of my OCD off and on. Right now it's the worst it has ever been. I've never really had to cope with it before so I don't really have many ideas other than distraction on how to stop. Which can't really be done at night and sometimes doesn't work during the day. Does anyone have any tips on things that have been helpful.
My behaviours with it are:
- My head is repeating conversations and/or the days events
- Song lyrics can be repeated for hours and hours (went on all day at work on Wednesday)
- Thoughts surrounding not being able to cope and the future
-Thoughts about my capability at work.
These thoughts play on a loop. I have a lot of problems getting to sleep at the minute because of it. It's the age old situation of how can you stop your head from thinking! Any tips are highly appreciated, this is reasonably new to me.

Maybe it's because of the theme of OCD I've been having but my tongue feels weird and I feel beyond gross. I don't feel I'm having urges but it still an uncomfortable feeling nonetheless. Has anyone else had this issue? I'm still hanging in here and reminding myself to to ignore the thoughts regardless of how awful they are.,"['OCD', 'urge', 'Thought']",['theme'],"['urge', 'Thought', 'theme', 'OCD']",1.0,,,,
"hi
this is just a general question about how people act with their partner when it comes down to having ocd and pure o.
i was just wondering because i feel that i depend on my boyfriend too much. when im having a bad day i need him with me, eventhough i want to be alone and i dont want to talk to anyone about it because ocd makes you want to be isolated i still feel i need him there, just as a comfort in my mind. however, i dont really comunicate with him because im stressed out and my mind is taken up by ocd and pure o.
this is making me feel like he isnt having a young fun relationship because he has to think about his girlfriends needs. especially as i cant handle some situations because my ocd gets bad and i need him to take me away meaning that he misses out on things. especially as we are only 18 and he shouldnt have to worry about stuff like this.
i also feel like im smothering him because i need him all the time as i dont feel comfortable and like i can be completley open with some of my friends as i over analyse every move and thing i say and worry about how they react. this is why i rely on him because, i know that he wont laugh at me doing my rituals or acting strangley.
i spose im just trying to find out if anyone else acts in this way or, how their partners cope because im worried im putting too much presure on him i just cant help it!

"Hi everyone,
Just looking for some input really. In my CBT, I've pretty much worked out my core beliefs for my other OCD themes. But, I wasn't sure about my health OCD. Everything, I see, touch on my body and experience with my body is currently a threat, which is hard having your own body as the trigger. I've had this theme on and off for a long while.
For me, it seems that my core belief is: have I got something seriously wrong with me?/I fear that I have something seriously wrong with me.
That's as far as I can get with working out this core belief. Can a core belief be a fear? Rather than a statement such as 'I'm a failure' (which is one of my other core beliefs, but for a different theme). 
Thank you for any input. X

"Hi everyone, just a quick question if that's ok.
I am a caring and kind person and people have said that about me, for example when I was a teacher. I promise I'm not blowing my own trumpet at all. 
Can OCD exaggerate this true core belief of being kind and caring? I've had hyper responsibility to others as an OCD theme in the past and my OCD is waxing at the moment and this theme has come back. Also, my OCD is also latching on to what friends, family etc think of me and I try to be too perfect in what I say, text to people etc and I worry how I'm coming across and if I've offended anyone, said the wrong thing, etc.
Just trying to understand while I wait for my CBT. 
Thank you for any input.
Best wishes,

"Whilst I wait for CBT, I am trying to understand as much as I can to help myself. 
After reading taurean's great post on core beliefs, I was wondering how I could work out mine? Or is that something I need to do in therapy? (hoping that my therapist is a good one).
Sorry if that's an impossible question.
If it helps to say....My theme is currently my health and fearing I have a variety of serious illness (I've feared so many in the last few months). But also at the moment when driving and reversing I can have the intrusive thought that I've run someone over and often I have to go back and check or stop and check. Triggers are simply reversing, going over a pothole or drain or any sound. I know I shouldn't but I always check. 
The driving issue seems to always accompany my main theme in the past 5 years, which is currently health as I said, but I've also had OCD around relationships and my husband cheating, about my friends and also many surrounding hyper responsibility. In a period of 'remission' when my baby was born, the driving issue went but now my OCD has returned, my driving issue returns.

"So one thing that has become very clear to me is that my OCD and low self-esteem are very much entwined and I need to deal with both of them, and pronto.  I've been thinking about unhelpful core beliefs I have around this.  I have a few.  But the main one I think is something like: """"""""If I have done something bad in the past, then it makes me an irredeemibly bad person.""""""""
Although I don't believe this rationally, deep down it is an unshakeable truth.  And I think this is the centre of almost all of my OCD themes.  I don't even really know why this scares me so much, this idea of being a bad person.  I'm not religious so it's not like I'm afraid of being punished.  I just have this intolerable fear of being morally bad. 
I've asked people about this and they mostly say they never worry about being a bad person.  My OH says she sometimes worries whether a particular action of hers was wrong, and feels guilty.  But she never questions her inherent """"""""OK-ness"""""""" as a person, it's just never crossed her mind to do so.  I can see how it is much healthier to look at life this way.  To view behaviour on a case-by-case basis, rather than as representative of your entire being.
So this is my first priority: to challenge this core belief of mine.  I'm going to try and do this using exposure and standard CBT methods.  I already get how the OCD side of all this works, but I think there is more to it than just OCD.

"Hello everyone!
My name is Jack and I'm 11 years old. For the past 5 or so years I've had OCD related to coughing. I've also had anxiety issues, which statred to decrease through the past few years.
I remember this starting when I was around other people who were ill. As soon as someone coughed I had to cough as well. Trying to supress this became extremely difficult. I managed to get this under control, but last year everything became wors ebecause of allergies.
I have the urge to cough and clear my throat many times a day and this is causing me to become very anxious. Because of my allergies some of this is understandable. However, I have developed certain rituals such as coughing exactly 3 times. It has reached a point where my throat is sore from coughing. I know that I should stop and that I do not need to this this, but evertime I stop I get a tighness in my chest and cannot stop thinking about it. After taking the steps to relieve my allergies I notices hat the coughing is getting worse. What is the best way to stop myself from doing this? I tried stoping completely for a few days, but everytime I clear my throat or cough naturally I return to my riatuls of coughing for an exact number of times. This dissapears almost completely if I am alone, however I am going to university and live in a house with several people.

"I really need some advice, quite honestly I am not sure who to turn to. It's quite a long post but I'll try and be as blunt as possible to get what I am saying across in the shortest way possible.
I'm only 16 and our family seems to have a thing for certain disorders. My Grandad was a sufferer of Bipolar as well as my mother, my sister is a sufferer of OCD. I'm asking for some support I guess as I am sort of lost in this matter. The other day I thought it may be worth doing some research into OCD as people have suggested I may have it, I stumbled across this site. I read through it and honestly it sounded like it was telling my life-story. I don't want to really self-diagnose and say I have OCD because I feel that's wrong of me, I feel then what if I didn't have OCD and I've lied to so many people about having it. Anyway.
As a young child my father abused me over the course of a few years, until eventually somebody found out. I never understood it at all, I didn't know what he was going to prison for, when I visited him there I even still sat on his lap. Everynight, every moment, it's not even triggered anymore. I just can't stop thinking about it, it drives me insane. I cry, I've self-harmed, I've thought about suicide and the thoughts never go away. What makes it worse is having a neice and nephew of 4 and 1. I look at them and I can't get near them, I don't care for them and I am terrified of what I could do to them. I think of it and it's horrible, I would never want to do that to a child yet my thoughts are still there and it makes me feel wrong, and that if I told somebody they would think I am sick in the head. It happens with other children as well, I can't bare it at all. I feel like I am going to follow in my dads footsteps and do what he did to my own children. I am very lucky to be blessed with such an amazing girlfriend who has told me if I am having any problems at all, she'll deal with it for me. I'm physically scared of touching them though, I am scared that if I touched them it would be wrong. Even if they were my own children.
I've noticed recently, if I feel I have hurt somebody then I will sit there and it will just escalate and escalate until I ask them for reassurance that I didn't hurt them or I end up unable to cope and end off walking away somewhere on my own and crying.
I do have issues with checking things as well, I like to make sure I can feel everything, keys, bus pass, headphones so I know where they are always so I am not constantly looking for them, with my phone I do this a lot as well as money, I keep feeling my pockets to make sure it's there and I'm not imaging something.
I also have a few hygeine issues, drinking out of other peoples glasses, avoiding hospitals, sharing food, that sort of a thing but not as bad.
It's mainly the intrusive thinking (I also have ruminations which has actually benefited me dramatically as it's made more intelligent in my opinion) but I am curious is there anything doctors can do, techniques and such to get my head to stop remembering memories as well as stop thinking of other things. I am thinking of going and my friend is coming with me, but I am scared of it.","['checking', 'Food', 'site', 'OCD', 'Thought']",['rumination'],"['rumination', 'site', 'checking', 'Thought', 'Food', 'OCD']",1.0,,,,
"Hi all,
I am finding it really hard to stop ruminating. I ruminate constantly about different triggers throughout my day. I feel that by ruminating I am working something out in my head until I am no longer worried about it anymore. Therefore I am scared that by not ruminating I am not going to work it out and just feel more worried.
To those that have stopped ruminating and beaten OCD, did you look back on the things you wanted to ruminate about and not be worried about them anymore. As in you don't need to check because you are confident in your memory etc?
A problem I have is I see a trigger whilst going about my daily business then within a short space of time I have to go over where I was going, what I was doing to check that my memory is correct. I literally have to go though in a detailed sequence in my head of my steps what direction I looked and everything. And for the latest example I didn't even see the triggers face. It was just that my mind assumed it could be a younger person so that feeling of mild panic (not outwardly shown) and hyper awareness kicked in.
And if, God forbid, I get an intrusive thought after seeing a trigger the anxiety and rumination is way worse!
Like tonight I was on my bike and saw a trigger and I thought 'stop worrying, you're cycling forward, you're not going to suddenly go back are you' and then I felt worried Even though I would never turn back I'm sure if I even slowed down I would panic more and go faster because I don't want to turn around, I have no reason to!!

"Hi
In the past few days I have been gradually resisting these dreaded mental rituals. I despise them, but when I have finished and got it right, I take an automatic breath outwards in relief that I have done them. I also hope that any of you who read this also take notice of my advice.
I think on a few occasions I have broken the ritual or resisted it, and nothing bad has happened. I hope to keep this up. I am still on the CBT waiting list, as they first gave me a booking to see them at 2 days notice, and I had to cancel due to work commitments. But my meds are helping.
I am awaiting my interview or any feedback on my application for promotion at work, but if I dont get it, I can always apply when there is another vacancy. A mate of mine says he isnt holding his breath as he has gone in for it. We hoep to get it as they want 6 people but 9 have applied but there is always other opportunities.

"Hello Everyone
I apologize in advance if this is a little long, but I am so confused. My family is constantly telling me that I must have OCD, because of all my little 'quirks', as they call them. I have never been diagnosed with this, but sometimes I wonder if my life might be easier if I went ahead and tried to find out if I DO have this, and get some help... Some of the things that bother me are pretty trivial I guess, but there are a couple of big things too...
One of the things I struggle with the most is that I cannot STAND for people, especially people I don't know real well, to look at me. I get so nervous that I almost go into a panic attack. I just cannot stand to be the center of attention. (I even freak out if I run into someone at the grocery store and they stop to say hi...I find myself avoiding people in public places that I know, because I get so nervous that they are going to approach me and try to start a conversation. I must be NUTS, because they are just trying to be friendly, and here I am freaking out over nothing...) I have no idea WHY I feel this way, but I do... It started when I was a teenager, and I'm 33-years-old now. I just get nervous. I find it hard to smile and make conversation because it just freaks me out. This sounds terrible, but the biggest nightmare situations for me were when my grandparents died, because I had to stand in the Visitation Line at the funeral home. So, of course, there were dozens and dozens of people in line to give their condolences, and here I was freaking out because I was so uncomfortable. I had to slip away more than once to go to the Ladies Room just to get some air. What is WRONG with me?? Could it be that I am the only person that this happens to??
Also, I am a Christian and have been since I was 18-years-old. I am in constant fear that I am going to do something that will cause me to not be able to go to Heaven when I die. I have attempted suicide in the past (a long story for another day...), and spent a couple of weeks in the psychiatric ward of our local hospital after this happened. My father, and my pastor and several other people I've asked about this have assured me that God can forgive any sin, and that as long as I am saved (which I believe that I am...), I will go to Heaven no matter what sin I commit. (And believe it or not, I'm a pretty good girl, so my sins are probably pretty tame compared to some folks!! And yet I still worry about everything little thing I do wrong... I could never, ever hurt someone...but I fear that God is going to send me to Hell because I attempted to hurt MYSELF, if that makes sense...I am tenderhearted to BUGS even, I kid you not... I'll scoop them up in a cup and take them outside before I smoosh them. I just didn't want yall to think I am some horrible person...) But it's like I try so hard to be good, and feel like I am constantly failing... If I get upset and a not-so-nice word just sort of flies out of my mouth, I feel horrible. If some random, bad thought just all-of-the-sudden pops into my head, I feel awful. (And that seems to happen a lot!! I can be PRAYING of all things, and all of the sudden something totally weird pops into my head... It's like I can't even concentrate when I'm trying to talk to God of all things!!)
Other little things that I do that my family teases me about are pretty trivial I guess. I cannot stand for things to be out-of-place in my home. My husband and I don't have children, so it stays pretty neat here most of the time. I do keep a big basket of toys in my living room, because I have a niece and 3 nephews who come to visit quite often. And I can't even let them put the toys away when they're done playing with them, because I feel like they have to be 'just so', or I am uncomfortable with this. (My hubby really rags me about THAT one...""""""""You have to SORT the TOYS?? Are you SERIOUS??"""""""" ... Yep, I sure am.) I don't like water spots in my sinks. When I'm finished washing dishes or washing my hands, I have to wipe all the water out of the sink. (This will drive me nuts...) My kitchen cabinets have to be just so. All the labels have to face the front, and everything has it's place, and if it's not IN it's place, I am uncomfortable. The shower curtains need to be closed after our showers. I have to make sure I wipe my kitchen counters off TWICE when I clean...once with a rag and once with a disinfectant wipe. I don't touch handles of public bathrooms, I have to open the door with my shirt. I can't use the top or bottom cup in a bag of paper cups. I can only wipe my mouth with a napkin ONCE before I feel like I need a new napkin. I cannot sit in the middle of an aisle at church or in a restaurant, I have to be on the end where I can get out. I have to fold my clothes just so. And I could go on and on and on. Just SILLY stuff, but for some reason, it makes me nuts!! Another thing that is big with me is my weight. I am a full-figured woman, and I am attempting to lose weight (and had lost about 37 pounds initally, but have put about 7 pounds of that back on, and that is driving me NUTS...) I step on the scales in my bathroom probably 25 times a day. And when it's higher than it was the time before, I am just disgusted with myself.
I don't know why I can never just be happy with my body, with my house, with my relationship with God, etc, etc, etc.
I used to be on anti-depressants, and medication for panic attacks and also for bi-polar disorder. My family felt that I was doing worse on all of the medications and encouraged me to go off of them. (And with health problems, and me not being able to work, my husband's income is what pays for everything, and if he says he won't continue to buy my medication, then I don't know what I can really do about that...) So I stopped seeing my psychiatrist and stopped the medicine. I do think I was on too much medication, but I did think I was benefitting from it a little bit at least. But it's hard to tell them that when your whole family is telling you that you don't need medication, you just need to trust in God. (Which I do, but sometimes I feel like God made the doctors and the medication to HELP people like myself...)
I'm sorry to go on and on, I am just so frustrated. I have no idea of this is OCD or not. I guess I just wanted to speak to some folks who HAVE been diagnosed with this, so that maybe they could help me figure out if this might be what's wrong with me...","['outside', 'Thought', 'living room', 'washing hands', 'open door', 'disgust', 'OCD', 'fear', 'kitchen', 'bathroom', 'Medication']",[],"['open door', 'outside', 'kitchen', 'washing hands', 'disgust', 'living room', 'Thought', 'fear', 'bathroom', 'Medication', 'OCD']",,1.0,,,

It all started 3 months ago, my eldest daughter was 5 months pregnant and well went for a routine scam to find out the sex of her baby. My wife. my daughter and her partner and my 4 year old granddaughter all went along to the scan. We were all so excited to find out what sex our new grandchild would be.
Our whole world exploded that day. I was at work when I got the phone call that no parent grandparent should ever get.
our little grandson had died, they couldn't find a heartbeat
I'm devastated I'm so lost I don't know what to do.

"Okay, so in response to my frustration with my last therapist who never got me to do anything more than open the fridge door whilst preparing food (and not wash my hands after), my new therapist has given me the massive challenge this week of not washing my hands before eating!! As in, at all! Even after touching public door handles etc.! He said that I might get ill, but that I need to accept that risk and see that if I do get ill I can cope with that outcome. :helpsmilie:
This is going to be a huge challenge for me. I mean, even people without OCD generally wash their hands before they eat. It's what you've been told since childhood! Is this him pushing me beyond what's normal to completely desensitise me to the fear?!
I'm really not sure I can do this, but I am quite excited by how much it scares me...perhaps real work and real challenges will result in real progress.

Also, we had the medication talk again...perhaps I'm coming round to the idea.

"Hi.
Two days ago, I started St Johns Wort, and am letting that kick in. If it doesnt work, mum will support me taking prozac. If I went straight to the prozac, I'd be """"""""on my own"""""""". It's too early to tell what effect it's having on me, especially since it's hard to stop drinking, this Easter.
Anyway, since the spike about a month ago, which landed me in Maudsley mental hospital overnight, I've had this crippling depression worse than the 10 years prior. Everyone says """"""""my gay fears are different, I think Ive actually turned bi/gay"""""""", but mine really is.
Anyway, I've not wanted to leave the house for the best part of a month. Even in my home, Im unproductive, just listening to mellow music, and posting on depression forums, and here.
Before this spike, I feel like ****, but at least there would be moments where I felt able to go clubbing, and very occassionally approach a girl. Yes, I'd feel guilty, and worried, like: """"""""why rope her in, when you might break up with her coz of your sexuality and thoughts"""""""", and most girls I didnt talk to for that reason. When I got drunk, I felt more at ease.
But now I feel zillion times worse. I was talking to a girl on MSN that I met in real life in 2007. She's from South America but lives in the UK. I often cant face her coz I feel like a gay fraud, and start wondering if she's attractive. She's exotic and would be way out of my league even if I were straight. But being a bisexual OCD headcase, I'm just way wrong for her. Good job she doesnt even like me in that way. I was talking to her and found out she has a friend here from the same area as her. I imagine he's a straight happy goodlooking stud. If I saw him, Id probably panic. And I just thought: What a cheek I have, trying to talk to her when I might be gay, and incroaching on this other man's turf,who could offer her security (he wont come out on her), etc. It just made me feel like my dream of having a girl is ever dying. I feel like, me with a gir has all this """"""""do I love girls?"""""""", """"""""will I stay with her?"""""""" surrounding it, but me with a man doesnt have that. I've never wondered """"""""would I stay with a man?"""""""". I dont seem to have that """"""""R-OCD"""""""" stuff abou men, and not coz Im not gay, but because ...I dunno, probably because, if I ever was with a man, the decision would be final, and no doubt would be there, but with a girl, the doubt and fear is there.
I doubt I'll ever look at a woman and go: """"""""uh-oh, she's attactive. I didnt want this to happen"""""""". It's like, the doubting only would doubt me """"""""heterosexually"""""""", not """"""""homosexually"""""""". Im wondering that, if I were with a man, all this worrying would end. Case closed. The big blip is I dont - at least I dont think - want to be with a man, but sometimes I do feel gay.
Balancing this, coursework, my friends, and any foolish attempt at approaching women is just too much. Meanwhile, my life is wasting away. Im waiting for CBT, and have St Johns Wort and prozac to fall back on, but all of it is """"""""support"""""""", not """"""""cure"""""""". I feel like it would be easier to die. I dont have any immediate plans to suicide yet though, but I just feel like a tormented waste. I cant enjoy it here, and dont help anyone else enjoy it.
If I live here as a celebate headcase, why bother? I am considering holidaying in a violent country, so I can be shot. Even then, Id have to ensure they dont just shoot me in the spine.

"As some of you may know, I have OCD that focuses around my health.
For many years, I have performed increasingly intricate rituals to avoid getting sick. I fear that even a common cold will lead to lifelong, debilitating illness, such as Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (for me). Even my diet, which looks enviously immaculate to an outsider (green smoothies, juices, raw, vegetarian), has been a control mechanism to prevent me from getting sick. However, over the past year I've let a lot of these behaviors fall by the wayside. I lost my job, got badly injured, stopped exercising, fell into a pattern of sleeping less and eating a lot of takeout, etc. Then, last week, I found myself knocked out by a bad cold (first time being sick in years) and immediately the panic---and crippling self-blame---took over. I can't shake the belief that this cold will turn into CFS and that it's my fault; my stupid, stupid fault. That if only I had been less lazy and irresponsible with my diet, sleep, exercise, self-care, stress levels, etc., this could have been avoided, yet instead I caused this and now I've ruined my life forever. I've realized that I truly believe(d) that I should have been able to prevent myself from getting sick for the rest of my life.
How does one deal with these feelings? It's such a trap that I find myself in. I very nearly hate myself. I'm also having so much trouble dealing with this fear of CFS. I find myself intensely monitoring my body for signs of fatigue, sore throat, worsening cold symptoms, etc., and freak out if the slightest thing feels off. I keep resorting to Xanax because the panic is getting so out of control. Last night I told my partner that for the first time in my life, I feel that my OCD is untreatable and that I'm beyond help. The sentiment is devastating, but true. I've been trying so hard to get better over the past year---engaging in a clinical trial, medications, therapy (mind you, I've been on meds and in therapy for 6 years)---yet I only seem to be getting worse. It's like the more awareness I have about OCD, the worse and more out of control my symptoms get. It really is like the OCD part of my brain knows I'm trying to kill it off and it grows even stronger in the wake of that.

"Hi I'm new to the forum, but sadly not to OCD which I've had on and off all my life (mostly themed around responsibility and contamination). It's only been diagnosed in recent years, also with a diagnosis of Aspergers. 
After years of struggling with it (and them) my cmht have admitted my ocd is severe and are looking at treatment further to some basic cbt I had a number of years ago. They're wanting to refer to the Maudsley but have said I need further cbt locally which hasn't yet been agreed. (Obviously if that happened and was successful I wouldn't need further treatment.) I live near, but not in, London. 
How would a referral to the Maudsley work and how do they decide which unit to refer to? Are there set criteria (eg y-bocs, meds etc) or are they just for national funding? I've obsessed over the internet (ha!) but find it all a bit complicated. Can anyone help?

"Hi Everyone and I hope you are all well.
Whenever I get unwell (currently have a very sore upper respiratory tract/chest causing me to have bad asthma last 7 days) I get locked into a depressive merry-go round 
. I will always be unwell
.I won't ever be able to breathe properly again
.I am going to die and wont see my family and young children again
.I can never do the things I enjoy again
  Rather than just taking my inhalers and treating the symptoms of a very tight chest at points during the day, I cannot take the focus off my breathing.
I am blessed with two 9 year old daughters and their smiles, fun and business that goes with us being home does take my attention away, but even then I'm, very coscious of my breathing, worrying about my breathing getting worse later, mentally testing my symptoms that feed into my self prognosis that I wont ever be healthy again.
I've been through the same anxiety through 2 week long headache spells, stomach ache periods so it isn't unusual for me.
My wife is fantastic and has supported me throughout my OCD treatment over the years and she said 'you know this wont last forever don't you' - intellectually I think I know this but cant feel it.
How do I see the bigger picture that all will be ok IN TIME, not to keep testing my current condition each second and to try and not be aware of every breath? I find my asthma with this sore chest worst in the evenings and even when doing OK during the day I start to fear breathing difficulties and feel it worsening, so too does my fear and anxiety. I always feel scared of it in the evenings and over obsess about it. Then the rumination and catastrophic thinking comes in.
  I am sorry, I know this is a lot but wondered if anyone else has had or have experience of this way of thinking? Strangely enough it isn't triggered by the Covid-19 and I'm not worried about getting it. It seems a trend that puts the brakes on my life every few months and want to be able to see some perspective. 
  Thank you so much and if I can help you in your daily battles, please feel free to ask - i think I've experienced almost all of the OCD types over my life!
Keep Smiling!

"Hi Everyone
I have joined a group, I don't want to say what it is if thats ok. Anyway, during the lunch break which was this afternoon, One of the people in the group started talking about Paedophilia and how Paedophiles do not look or come across as being odd to the rest of the world and how they befriend a child's parents and like a sneak thief, abuse the child without going un-noticed. Well the group went on to have a very indepth discussion about this. My skin was prickeling with nerves and I was fidgeting around in my chair obviously unbeknown to the rest of them that my OCD lies in this area. I have been in a state of shock and rumination since then. When I left the group earlier on this evening and returned home I started sobbing my heart out to my partner, I've only just stopped. I feel as though I can't get away from it. Its on the news, radio, internet and now in this group I've joined. I've had such a stressful time lately without all this OCD C**p!! I just feel its trying to spoil every area of my life.
Thanks for letting me vent. I see my Psych on Thursday. I just feel terrible and down at the moment.

"OCD lately seems like it is dominating every aspect of my life, and since the summer each episode comes back stronger than the one before, and can last from weeks to months at a time.
Lately the theme has been that I feel like I’ve harmed someone by my actions (is this called “responsibility OCD”?). I actually have a feeling of sadness right now when I look back at my life and see how much of my time was taken up by OCD. Has anyone ever had this “mourning” experience? One piece of advice that was comforting to me is by the Bible Scholar Rashi: “Accept with simplicity everything that happens to you”.
There used to be a site called “Stuck In A Doorway” where several people gave me advice, and whom I also gave advice to. Unfortunately it looks like the site may have closed, and I didn’t save these people’s contact info anywhere else. I would really like to have a few OCD friends to share advice with, and may also join a support group at a local hospital. For a few years in my life I overcame OCD and got a law degree. Now my OCD is back and is heavily affecting my work, and as a consequence my clients are being affected (I do civil cases).
Over the summer I was in Court and talking to a couple of female witnesses who were not connected to any case of mine. I was kind of flirting with them, but later learned by over hearing one of their conversations that one of their boyfriends was dangerous and abusive. He was there that day too and I worried that he may have seen me flirting with them, even though he wasn’t in the room, and that he would beat one of them severely for it. I immediately left the court.
Although I’ve never been unfaithful to my wife, despite going through a period where I felt she married me with improper motives to some extent, about a month and a half ago I had cyber sex on two occasions. Basically this is where you and the person on the other end watch each other with a web cam. This was the first time I’d done this and hadn’t done it since. Both times were with the same person. I feel that this was wrong to do since I’m married, and don’t plan on doing it again. For me I turned to it as a release where I thought no one was getting harmed, and would be much less likely to hurt my marriage than actual cheating. But my OCD is causing a very different issue: I feel like by having cyber sex with woman, I may actually have harmed her if she was not the age she told me she was. Before doing this, one of my specific worries was that I didn’t want to encounter any women under age. For that reason I went to “20 something” and “30 something” chat sites. She told me she was 20, and I didn’t think much of it. Afterwards, though, I kept asking myself what if she is really only like 16? I can’t say she didn’t look 20, but with some people you never know. Although there is not a very high likelihood, she could’ve potentially been as young as 14 (assuming she looked mature for her age).
I feel like if she really was this age, I could’ve had a negative influence on her. Lately all I do is wonder if I’ve harmed her somehow. There is also another way that I felt like I may have harmed her: The second time we did it she noticed my ring, and I told her it was just something my girlfriend gave me as a joke. She didn’t question me on it after that. Now, however, I feel like I caused her a lot of shame and guilt because she will feel that she maybe ruined my marriage because of what she did as well as my family. I try and get into her mind and think what she would think. I imagine that she thinks that maybe my wife found out and divorced me because of her- despite the fact that she has no reason to believe she was the only one I did this with (even though that’s the truth), and that she alone could be to blame for a fight with my wife for something my wife never in reality found out about, and that it in fact led to a divorce and suffering). Am I assuming she has OCD too to feel that she thinks this way?
A part of me wants to turn myself into the police, even though they would most likely do nothing because we don’t know if in fact she was of the right age or not, and there is little evidence pointing in either direction. In the U.S. it is no excuse under the law that the man thought the woman was of legal age, when in reality she wasn’t. I think this law makes sense. I have communicated with her a few times since, but it’s been insubstantial. I want to know she’s ok, and seem to be making that my mission.
I can’t stand my life and don’t think I am even worthy to have become a member of society. Where am I in my life I do not know. I am cordial and friendly to people who I meet in my day to day routine, but sometimes I just want to be as far away from the world as possible so that I don’t cause harm. I hope that my mere posting of this topic does not cause anyone harm.
It’s hard to say how it feels to realize at 32 what a big portion of my life OCD has taken from me. At times I just want to rebel by living a life of wine and women for as long as practical. Another part of me says rebel in a positive way and help others through your work and by sharing whatever you learn. All I can say is that I want to feel like I’m doing the right thing in life, and that I am decent, and functioning well.","['sadness', 'rash', 'talking', 'anger', 'shame', 'guilt', 'hope', 'Thought', 'site', 'OCD']",['theme'],"['talking', 'OCD', 'site', 'anger', 'rash', 'Thought', 'sadness', 'shame', 'theme', 'hope', 'guilt']",1.0,,,,
"By Ashley Fulwood (Chief executive)
Whenever I see OCD used in conjunction to describe non OCD behaviour I do tend to get a bit annoyed, I would like to use a stronger emotion but I am sure Kylie (OCD-UK chair) would not be too pleased if I swore on the main website.
The latest reason for my disappointment (again I am being polite here) is the Daily Mail and the feature writer Diana Appleyard for describing her desire for some poncy cushions as 'Help, I've got OCD (that's Obsessive Cushion Desire)' in yesterday's Daily Mail. If you can bring yourself to look here is the link.
Naturally we are told by some to get a sense of humour about it, but when you have OCD it really is not something that it is easy to laugh off and that is why I shoot from the hips with my verbal contempt for such poor journalism.
Of course the Daily Mail is not the first to print incredibly offensive and crass comments that continue to trivialise the seriousness of the condition, and I am sure they won't be the last publication to print something so stupid, but as the comments underneath the article also show, those without first-hand experience of OCD are oblivious to the suffering and desperation that OCD can cause. I don't blame them personally for not understanding, but I do blame the Daily Mail for not showing more restraint and not taking more of a pioneering leadership role in promoting serious journalism around all aspects of Mental Health..
OCD is also known as the 'secret illness' because people are so secretive about their condition, even with family and friends, partly through fear of what people will think, and articles like this don't help, in fact they continue to enforce stigma around OCD and perhaps further marginalises people with OCD.
I have already been in touch with the Daily Mail and invited them to help repair some of the damage by running a series of OCD health features during the Awareness Week in October... I will keep you informed if they accept our suggestion, but as someone on Twitter just pointed out, this is the Mail, what do I expect!
All of this shows the importance of OCD Awareness Week in October to try and change the perception of OCD, and in fact our theme this year is to highlight the impact that OCD can have on peopleâ€™s lives. Most of you reading this won't need me to explain how isolating and desperate this illness can leave us, but it is clear from the Mail's use of the OCD term that the wider public still just do not get it and so it is down to you and me to change that!
Letâ€™s keep fighting!

"I feel like a different person than I was a few years ago. I used to be energetic, happy, and content with my life, despite some of my problems. Now, I can't go a day without getting some kind of panic attack. I have quite severe OCD and it affects a majority of my decisions in my life. Although I have dealt with it for many years, I feel like I am at a breaking point. Every day I wake up miserable. I have no motivation to do anything anymore and I find relief in thinking to myself """"""""I wont feel like this if im dead"""""""".
I've posted about my OCD before, but I'd like to fill in the gaps. I have had OCD since I was around 13. I am deathly allergic to any type of nut, I am mildly allergic to chicken. Over the past few years I have developed an extreme phobia of eating at restarautns or at places I do not know are safe. I recently got back from NY and the entire time I was there I was having panic attacks. I have pretty bad asthma paired with post nasal drip. What that does is cause me to have asthma attacks when I try to run and get in shape. I had a gynecomastia surgery a few years back to remove excess tissue above my left chest muscle, to which I was told my muscle some-how detatched. This causes an odd indentation when I flex, adding to the already incredible amount of insecurity I have.
There's more but I dont want to make this excessively long. Basically, all this combined makes me HATE my life and I think of ways to kill myself daily. All the medications I've taken give me sexual side affect, and anyone with a girlfriend will tell you this isnt something you want to have happen, especially when my girlfriend is one of the things keeping me from doing something drastic.
OCD is the primary reason I was severed from college as well. I had a little over two years completed and have yet to go back. I have a full time job at a University which gives me discounts on classes, but im so stressed all the time that I dont think I could do it.
Im sorry this was long and unorganized but i just dont know what to do anymore. I feel like i cant escape the feeling and each day that goes buy just adds pressure. I just want to go an entire day without hoping I get in a car accident. Life shouldnt be this hard for me.
Another thing. Im almost sure I have bi-polar disorder. My sister has it, and after noticing my insane mood changes, I cant see myself NOT having it. I told myself when I was younger that I would not let OCD dictate my life. Now, im not sure.","['coma', 'urge', 'Medication', 'OCD']",['excessive'],"['urge', 'coma', 'excessive', 'Medication', 'OCD']",,1.0,,,
"My sexual thoughts just aren't bothering me at the momet. My meds and my CBT are working wonders. I still sometimes trigger, but the rumination doesn't happen.

Im getting hot at catching the thoughts and being mindfull at what my brain is doing and letting it do it without trying to out think it.
At the moment my biggest worry is just general anxiety, especially about my studying and feeling depressed and lonely but very few thoughts.

"Hi, everyone. I'm a 26-year-old female, have had symptoms of OCD since the age of 7, and was officially diagnosed at 21. I was a very outgoing child, did well all throughout school, and had an easy time of making friends. However, I feel like my life got stunted along the way. My OCD hit hard in my early 20s during (primarily a harm OCD theme), and I dropped out of college...and kind of out of life as well. I just haven't made much progression at all. Other former classmates are getting promotions, buying homes, dating, getting married, having children. Meanwhile, I've been working the same customer service job for 4 years with no hopes of advancement, toying with the idea of going back to school, and coming home every night to my cat and my mother in the apartment we share. I don't have any friends outside of social media and my coworkers--whom I might go out with once or twice a year. One big social impediment is that I don't drive. Most of my coworkers don't know that my mom drops me off at work everyday, so if I'm ever asked to make a run to the post office during the work day or go out afterwards, I either make some excuse as to why I need a ride or just flake out entirely. 
My love life...yeesh. I haven't had a boyfriend in about 4 years, and I pretty much just served as his beard, as he was """"""""in the closet"""""""" at the time. I have no sexual experience because I just feel fat and gross all the time and don't want anyone to touch me. I also don't know what way the OCD would manifest itself if I got in a relationship, so that keeps me single. But I mean, it's not like I have to do much pushing. """"""""Loser virgin who lives at home due to finances and can't drive"""""""" isn't much of a draw for most guys 
I just feel really stuck right now. It's kind of a neverending cycle. The lack of social and romantic interaction due to my obsessiveness keeps me from GAINING any actual experience--which in turn depresses me and causes me to be even more obsessive and anxious.

"Hi guys,
Haven't been on here for a while but seeing as I am struggling a bit and my friends don't really know what to say to me I thought I would post. Not for reassurance, as I am aware that this only feeds OCD, but for advice on what to do next.
I have suffered with OCD since 15 and this have covered the themes of HOCD and POCD. I spent a lot of my time as a young adult obsessing about my sexuality to the point that I actually was quite happy to be gay in the end. Of course, the anxiety slowly dissipated and now I feel that I am straight. I couldn't care either way now.
Problem is, I struggle in beginning relationships. I have only ever had short term relationships and I am usually the one to break it off because I get scared of hurting the other person. I always feel that they are too into me too quickly but I never feel the same. I analyse how I feel, what I feel, whether it's genuine, whether this person is right for me, whether I am right for them, whether they really like me or they just want to have a girlfriend.
Of course, this is an endless cycle of
ruminations. Hence it ends up looking more appealing to be on my own because I can deal with myself. There is no-one else to worry about. But then I want nothing more than to be in a committed loving relationship. I know in my mind what I want from a partner, what I find attractive, what I have to give back. So I'm in an cycle!
I have not dated for 8 months... And recently I have been messaging a guy on a dating site. Very long messages went back and forth for a long time and we found out we have a lot in common and similar views for the future. We spoke quite a lot and got on really well. It felt very different.
However, we met on Sunday and although it was a lovely day and we got on well, there was 'no spark' for me. I didn't come away feeling how I wanted to feel basically.
Now I am thinking I shouldn't continue it because it's not 'the one' but then I am analysing that decision thinking I need to see how it goes and relax into it, maybe he was a little nervous etc. But then I feel if I continue and i don't develop feelings I could hurt him because he is already quite smitten (although he is being a gentlemen and holding back... I can tell). So can u see my torment?
I've done this pattern of behaviour for a long time and I know it's me and my OCD. I also know that I can't go on like this and I need to change. But I don't know what to do now? Do I stop seeing him? Do I continue it to break through this? Do I get therapy? How do u go about that without long waiting lists etc. I found the NHS to be very slow the first time I went to therapy when I was younger.
Any input would be appreciated.

"Hi!
I wonder if anyone daydream excessively..? (I searched amongst the topics, but didn't find anything, but it seems to be linked to ocd in some cases)
It feels like I daydream constantly. I'm having a bit of a low time in general at the moment as well and when I do, it's even more tempting to escape reality and lose myself in a daydream. I've done it as long as I can remember, but haven't really thought about how much time I waste until recently. And how obsessed I am! And what it does to my mood when I 'leave' the daydream and return to the (often) dull reality. I don't want to end up living in a fantasy world, without at least trying to make my reality more the way I obviously crave. If I could just switch those daydreams off..
I have searched for information about it and, as mentioned, even if it doesn't seem to be seen as a real disorder, it's sometimes linked to anxiety disorders. On the good side, it's seen as a source for creativity, but for me, I really don't see it that way.
The hardest bit is when the daydream creates stories involving real people that I meet. It's always people that I don't know well, or have just met; in other words when there's still plenty of room for me to imagine what they might be like and free to 'make' them amazing and fitting well into the daydream. Even if I'm always (painfully!) aware that the daydream is not reality, it still blurs everyday life a bit. What I'm trying to say is that because my imagination always seems to be ready to switch on, I very often for example start to look for signs or imagine that somebody is interested in me (in a romantic way), as soon as I start talking to that person. It makes me feel quite silly (I'm 32..), but the daydreaming takes over. I also feel that I'm not myself (or being able to show my good sides), because I'm not my 'neutral' self, if that makes sense. So then the daydream has in a way stopped me from or made it harder for me to actually, possible get what I want, in reality.
I'm also quite sure and a bit embarrassed, that when I do this and sort of get distracted by the daydream and believe that this (poor!) person and I have some bond, that I probably come across a bit strange or desperate too..! As I said, I know the daydream is not real/reality, but it affects reality..
It feels like the more I look, the more I find with myself that is in need of some kind of..help. Gah! Or maybe it's just all connected in some way; that sounds more like the case.
All thoughts and/or advice would be appreciated to hear.

p.s Sorry about writing a long novel. Maybe I should write down those 'daydream-stories' instead","['OCD', 'Anxiety disorder', 'anxiety', 'anxiety', 'interest', 'talking', 'writing', 'Thought']",['excessive'],"['talking', 'anxiety', 'Anxiety disorder', 'interest', 'writing', 'Thought', 'excessive', 'OCD']",,1.0,,,
"Essentially, anxiety is a state of mind in turmoil and triggering the """"""""flight or fight"""""""" anxiety response, with the adrenal glands pumping chemicals into the body that tense the muscles, push up the blood pressure, quicken the breathing and shut down other body processes like digestion.
So it causes a big bodily reaction, and this excessive state of arousal is fine if you need to runaway from danger, but inappropriateand unhelpful if you are in your bedroom, for example.
Normal anxiety arising from sudden danger that resolves itself is quickly dissipated and the body and mind return to normal.
So when our anxiety is caused by OCD, to take away the undesirable high arousal we need to get calm and lower the threat so our anxiety recedes.
CBT, challenging irrational thoughts, the four steps, graded exposure response prevention, engaging with friends on this forum are the tools to tackle the underlying issues that are the anxiety triggers. Anxiety Medication can be of short term help, but its not powerful enough to deal with high levels of anxiety where dealing with the source thoughts is essential, and can be habit-forming.
But here are some other helpful things.
Sharing your OCD problems with a significant other, who can undertake a carer role to help and encourage you
Creating a map of your type of OCD , how it affects you, what strategies are available to you, and trying them and recording successes and noting failures.
Relaxation
I use guided meditations - you can download these from Amazon and other sites, and buy CDs and downloads from organisations like New World Music - try them, they help you to calm your mind and body. Like me, you can put them onto your smartphone - I use them on the train.
Exercise
Work out in the gym or just going for a brisk walk/climbing the stairs will burn off stress chemicals and calm you.
Diet
Following some healthy macrobiotic guidelines will boost serotonin levels and wellbeing. Such foods are walnuts, oily fish, wholemeal bread and rice, fruit vegetables and salads . Multivitamin and mineral supplements are also helpful.
Sleep
Try and go to bed at a similar time each night, and don't take stimulants - caffeine, alcohol or smoke - too soon before bedtime.
A milk drink can be useful and, if tense or distressed, a natural herbal sleep inducer like Kalms sleep is also beneficial.
If need be, try reading a book or get up and watch TV.
Hope this helps folks.","['bedroom', 'Irrational thoughts', 'Medication', 'role', 'site', 'Food', 'hope', 'anger', 'Thought', 'OCD', 'anxiety', 'anxiety', 'process']","['excessive', 'irrational']","['role', 'anxiety', 'process', 'OCD', 'site', 'Food', 'bedroom', 'anger', 'Thought', 'irrational', 'excessive', 'Irrational thoughts', 'Medication', 'hope']",,1.0,,,
"I've been on a feelings rollercoaster lately - it probably feels worse than it is but generally I do not like feeling strong emotions unless they are positive ones. Who does eh? In my mind feeling sad or low especially causes spikes, as my bully tells me 'see what happens when you don't listen to me? You feel rubbish.'. Earlier this afternoon I felt very low which seemed to be inexplicable.
I thought it might help me if I wrote a few thoughts down. I think perhaps I am generally uncomfortable with feeling low or any passive feelings - I am only comfortable with joy or anger or 'active' feelings and somehow feeling sad does not match my 'perfectionist' views on how I should be. It is weak or 'proves' I can't handle fighting my bully. I am happier when I am angry at it.
So earlier when I felt low I tried hard to think that it was simply okay to feel sad, and in fact it was probably normal considering the ups & downs I've been through recently, such as a holiday I went on that was in parts fun and in parts tough. It's irrational to only think I should feel happy about going on that hol, as though it was a big achievement it also took a lot out of me, so I have decided its okay to have mixed feelings about it right now, and that I'll assess it again in a few weeks.
I would like to be happier about feeling sad though! I wondered if anyone else struggles with feelings and has perhaps hang ups about feeling certain feelings.","['feeling strong', 'joy', 'anger', 'Thought']","['spike', 'irrational']","['anger', 'Thought', 'joy', 'feeling strong', 'spike', 'irrational']",1.0,,,,
"OK, so I have been doing a bit better the last week or so. Many of you helped me through a real rough patch not so long back. This, the support of my friends and family and getting back to work has allowed me to get a little perspective. It is only a slight improvement though, things are still very difficult and I am well aware that I am only ever 10 minutes away from that OCD insanity.
I am having a spike at the moment. Maybe I am seeking reassurance, but would appreciate any info if somebody has experienced something similar to this......
A memory came back to me the other day, accompanied by that familiar anxiety kick. It was during my first bout with OCD about 8 years ago when I was paranoid that I could harm or abuse a child. I was sat in the back of a car with a boy of about 5 or 6 who had an unusual mouth. It was shaped liked a woman's and made me feel uncomfortable. So I started checking, (whilst appearing perfectly normal to everybody else in the car - an ability us sufferers have).
Every time I glanced at him to check, he was kissing or licking something, (a toy microphone he had, a bear, a lolly). This made me more uncomfortable so I continued to focus on it. I then noticed that I had what I can only describe as inappropriate arousal. Obviously this caused me a great amount of anxiety.
Somehow I rationalised it at the time. Firstly, I was focussing not on the child, but on an adult feature that I would normally find attractive. Secondly, at the time I would often find myself in a state of semi-arousal in the back of a car, which could have combined with my checking. (Boys will understand this!). Thirdly, I felt uncomfortable. I didn't enjoy it, I crucified myself at the time.
So what is inappropriate arousal? Could it have been the same as groinal response? I am not sure it is, as if I am being honest I can imagine how it happened. If I picture a nice female pair of lips in my head, and nothing to do with a child, I like the image. But shouldn't my head have been able to distinguish that the situation involved a child, therefore ruling out any arousal?
Are these doubts even OCD at play? Wouldn't anybody be concerned at such a turn of events - If it is OCD, what is the OCD element? Is it that I can't shrug the memory off, even though this could perhaps happen to somebody else who could? Is it the inability to not leave it in the past because I need to check it continually. If I am being honest, I am also slightly spiked by a post on another topic that revealed to me that child abusers rarely just like children, they like adults as well. Could this be me, even though this is the only memory of this type I have and I DEFINITELY like adult women!
Thanks again for all your help so far.

This maybe off-topic but it's causing massive issues with my OCD. I have a narcissistic boss who continually rejects every idea or suggestion I have with no real reasoning only that it is not in his own personal agenda. This is creating such intense rumination and self doubt that I feel like I have been gaslighted and am losing control of my mind and thoughts. He has manipulated other people in my company who I considered allies before and now I feel so isolated I cannot focus or concentrate on anything with all the continuous thoughts going through my head. If I leave the job I will lose out a lot financially which will then cause even more pressure  - I was wondering if anyone had any thoughts on how to address this?,"['flatulence', 'OCD', 'Thought']",['rumination'],"['rumination', 'Thought', 'flatulence', 'OCD']",1.0,,,,
"Hello!
(Please let me know if this isn't the right place to be posting this kind of question. I am new and learning the ropes!)
I am a college student in Minnesota who is struggling with a new realization that I almost definitely have OCD. I just started therapy and am working with my therapist on my panic attacks and constant rumination but the actual term OCD did not come up in our one session so far.
But my question relates to talking to people about what I am going through. I am finding myself severely struggling right now and not knowing who to turn to.
My mother, who has always been one of my best friends, is refusing to face the fact that I obviously need help. She can't seem to deal with the idea that I am not perfectly healthy, even though my OCD does not mean she failed as a parent. So I find it difficult to talk to her about my feelings.
I am also feeling the loss of a serious relationship because my ex-boyfriend was my best source of support through rough times and at those moments where the OCD feels so overwhelming, I miss him more fiercely than ever. It becomes a little unbearable. Does anyone have any ideas on how to separate the pining for him from the anxiety of different OCD triggers?
I have several wonderful friends who will listen to me until I lose my voice talking about this but they cannot relate. Their responses tend to be """"""""Just relax and it'll work out in time"""""""" or """"""""Try to focus on something else"""""""". They're trying to help but they have no way of knowing that all I want to do is focus on something else, anything else but right now, can't seem to do that! I don't know if I should try to give them a better sense of what I feel or just accept that they cannot empathize.
Is this one of those things where you can't understand unless you have been there and so it is unfair to expect the kind of support I am craving from people who just can't relate?","['anxiety', 'anxiety', 'talking', 'OCD']",['rumination'],"['rumination', 'talking', 'anxiety', 'OCD']",1.0,,,,
"Hi All,
:helpsmilie: I have been driven here under sheer fustration.
I suffer from OCD, have done so for the longest time. Although it has been at varying degrees. Now i am experiencing the worst attack ever, coupled with depression, nervous tics and rapid eye movement, excessive blinking I feel like the worlds biggest freak show.
How is it possible to deal with other peoples stares, giggles, pointing and blatant mickey taking? I get this everywhere I go. At one stage I thought them, but to be honest that takes alot of energy and I am fed up with having to defend myself or explain myself to people. Besides I'm using all that energy trying to stop myself shouting out my random thoughts.
Guys, I'm just feeling rather out on a limb and would welcome any coping strategys, or any similar experiences or lets face it anything......

"I thought I would copy over this response I gave on another thread, as others may find it useful.
It is based on my own experiences in therapy, reading self-help books, using an OCD work-book and responses from the forum.
As is usual with me, I keep things simple. you might read a few pages in a self - help book to get to the gist of this!
With OCD you need to simply note which intrusions are OCD, be aware of the meaning being attributed - it will likely be an exaggeration of threat or consequence, or a turning on its head of a core value - give it no belief and refocus away onto something beneficial and distracting.
Do this camly each time the intrusion tries to assert itself.

Aside from this standard approach, the normal CBT treatment includes exposure and response prevention (ERP).

Here you work out - for each theme of OCD if you have more than one - a a sliding scale of your triggers according to the degree of anxiety/distress.

One then starts at the trigger with the lowest level of distress and, at a time when you feel reasonably calm and able to do this, you undertake a deliberate exposure to the trigger - either confronting it actually or virtually.. This should be for a reasonable period - at least a few minutes - during which time you sit with the trigger and the anxiety response it provokes.

Whilst doing this, remind yourself that the meaning being given to the trigger is OCD - a falsehood, exaggeration of minimum threat or whatever. Stick with the exposure through that reasonable time, then come out of it.

It may take more than one attempt, but what should happen is that, as you realise the response is a worry about it being true rather than an actual threat,the anxiety level should fall.

When you achieve the anxiety level dropping away on that trigger, next time move up to the next trigger on your hierarchy and follow the same format.

The goal here is that each trigger should no longer cause the anxiety response or remain in focus as an obsessive thought - but drift away and resolve.

You will neeed to keep up your ERP by regular exposure or it can lose effect.

Good luck with this.

"Hi everyone,
This forum has been an absolute God send from the day I found it. I have been a little absent from it lately for two reasons. 1) I am trying super hard to avoid rumination and am doing rather well, and find that coming here kinda makes me think OCD all the time. 2) As some of you know, I am studying counselling at the moment, at an increased rate to the norm, as I have reduced my working hours to pack more studying in. What I am finding is that when I am not studying, I need a recharge of being away from this kind of stuff. And find that when I jump onto the forum, I am reading posts and not really taking them in like I normally would, I then reply to far fewer than normal and it tires me (NOT peoples posts!), just the amount that my brain can actually absorb.
When I dont hear from certain names for a while, I panic a little, thinking I hope they are ok.... I therefore wanted to post a quick note of my absence for a little while, as when I am not studying, I really need to rest my stupid brain and watch some football or drink some Machiato, whilst watching Fawlty Towers

"This week is OCD Awareness Week, and each day we will be publishing a different account of Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder.
Today's fantastically positive story is being published by OCD-UK volunteer Ruth, and is published with permission from her blog.
  Dear OCD sufferer,
My name is Ruth, I am 47 years old. I was diagnosed with OCD when I was 24.  I believe I had it for a long time before that, but there was very little awareness of OCD back then.
I really wanted to write to you to let you know that there is hope.
This week is OCD awareness week, and I really wanted to write to you to let you know that there is hope, that I have been where you are now, living with severe OCD. I was in the depths of despair, believing life would only ever be a constant stream of terrorising and guilt ridden days. I have lost count of the number of people I believe I had either harmed through my mistakes or through carelessness. When I was at my worst every day I believed I had either seriously harmed or killed people through coming into contact with contamination and not acting responsibly enough. This was despite the hundreds of daily rituals, changing clothes every time I went out and showering several times a day until I could take no more, throwing away clothes and items I felt were too contaminated to ever be clean again, disinfecting shoes, my phone, handbag, my car – the daily rituals were endless, but they were never enough. However hard I tried to avoid contaminates, and however many times I showered and changed into clean clothes, I still believed I had left a risk to others lives, it was exhausting and I can still remember the desperate yearning I had for some rest from the thoughts of being a bad person that was selfishly not doing enough to protect others.
I wasn’t living my life, I was existing, I would wake up and immediately feel horrific fear and a feeling of disgust about myself and the rituals I had been too tired to complete the previous day.  My mind would search for all the possible harm I may have caused, the deaths I might be responsible for, the contamination I may have left in a public place that someone may now be in contact with, and how it was now destroying their lives and those around them….. The thoughts were relentless, my mind was filled with the harm and the deaths I was causing, I felt a disgusting careless human being that didn’t deserve to live.
Over time I just avoided more and more normal every day activities, just in case I came into contact with a contaminate and caused harm. I also decided that even my words caused harm, and so it was best I never met anyone or spoke to anyone. Eventually I decided it was unsafe to even go outside unless I really had to. I avoided being around other people so I couldn’t cause them harm, it was just too risky and surely if I avoided the world my feelings of harm and guilt would stop. Obviously they didn’t stop, I had a family who lived in the world and in my fragile mind I believed they were also being contaminated by the outside world. I had to protect them; I had to make sure they performed the same rituals as I did.  This is where I really wish I had STOPPED!  Involving my children in my rituals is a guilt I still carry today, I find it impossible to forgive myself for times my OCD affected them. I can only tell myself that I was very unwell, I believed at the time I was protecting them as any mother would – but of course I wasn’t, my rituals to protect them were the very things that were causing them harm.  I can only say sorry to them now, for the times I believed I was too contaminated to hug them at night, and for ever letting my OCD affect their childhood.
OCD destroys lives if you let it take control.
Eventually OCD robbed me of my job, my home and my husband. OCD destroys lives if you let it take control. It does not protect you and others; it rips lives apart and takes away the joy of life.
What I really want to tell you is that there is hope; you can learn that when you have OCD what you FEEL is not always REAL (I am still learning this). I am in recovery now, I am still working on some OCD issues, but I am no longer existing, I am living!  I have two dogs now and I go out and walk and get completely contaminated every day! So does my house! I am loving life again, doing things I had avoided for years. I am back with my husband, I go on holidays, I work, I visit family, I go out with friends, I hug my children as tightly as I can– I allow myself to be happy and to live! I have learned that the risks I believed I came across every day were just not worth the agony I went through or that I put my family through.  I can tolerate that we all live with doubt and that we can never rule out risk in our lives. But I can now rationally evaluate how small these risks are, and how trying to rule them out just makes life not worth living.
Don’t listen to, you are treatment resistant, you know what to do, why are you not doing it?
I urge you to believe there is a ‘cure’. To believe that you deserve the right support and to fight until you get it. If you cannot be helped through your local mental health team, then fight to be sent to a specialist NHS OCD treatment centre, believe that you have as much right as anyone else to have a place there and to receive the best treatment. Read the Nice Guidelines for OCD and the Stepped Care Approach https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/cg31/chapter/1-Guidance Don’t listen to “You are not engaging in therapy”, “You have had the  6 or 12 sessions of CBT that you are entitled to”, “You are treatment resistant” , “You know what to do, why are you not doing it?”, “You have had considerable amount of CBT sessions now, what do you expect us to do for you?!”  I heard all those expressions over many years, and I was at the point of believing that I would have OCD for life – until I went to one of the OCD-UK Conferences and heard professionals talk about good CBT for OCD, finding the right therapist for you, and how OCD was a completely treatable condition. I heard about people who had had OCD all their lives and had also been told they were treatment resistant, but with the correct support managed to overcome their OCD and reclaim their lives and happiness.
OCD-UK told me to never give up, despite probably having seen more professionals than any other OCD sufferer! And I am so glad I didn’t.
I now see a Clinical Psychologist that I can trust, who seems to believe I deserve to be supported until I am recovered, who has given me the time I needed to work through my OCD at my pace. I see him through the NHS local mental health team, he is the 4th psychologist I have seen through this team over the years, I also saw one privately and spent six weeks as an inpatient at the Priory on an intensive OCD program.  OCD-UK told me to never give up, despite probably having seen more professionals than any other OCD sufferer! And I am so glad I didn’t, because I do believe I have finally found the Psychologist that can help me completely overcome my OCD. I have good days and I still have bad days, but on those bad days I now have professional support to help me pick myself up and start fighting again. Everyone deserves to be given that support. I cannot claim to be cured – but I am determined to get there, and the psychologist I work with has tried many different approaches and not given up on me. I am currently reading a book my psychologist suggested I buy, and that we follow this approach for future sessions, and I actually believe it is the final piece in the jigsaw to my recovery.  I finally had my light-bulb moment reading it last night!
Please don’t give up on yourself – you can get well, you can beat your OCD and be happy again, life can be wonderful and your mind can be peaceful.

"I was never scared of death but ever since I became a dad and took a big trip for work, my OCD has latched onto death OCD. I wrote a letter to my family in case something happened on my work trip. The letter made me emotional and led me to have a panic attack over the Atlantic Ocean. It comes in the form of myself perishing and leaving my family behind or vice versa. It then tends to wander out on its own """"""""what if I was left all alone and lost my sense of purpose and that made me suicidal,"""""""" or """"""""what if I have OCD with all those around me gone? Who would I speak with?"""""""" all the way to questioning my purpose. Additionally, it has gone to where I fear that if someone close to me does pass away that I won't be able to recover because my grieving along with my OCD would leave me completely catatonic and/or severely depressed. 
This is my third theme of OCD in the past twenty years. I know it is typical for it to change themes. I get it. What's funny is that I never cared about this theme before and now it's got my body in a massive frenzy. It makes me fearful to travel as I anticipate another panic attack but I also know that the opposite is to become agoraphobic which I will not let happen. I know this will pass but, damn, I'm exhausted from feeling fear over and over on a consistent basis. It's an outer body experience. 
For me it's all mental as I don't have rituals. Not physical ones anyway. I have gone through ERP in the past along with CBT. I need to hunker down and egg these fears on. I had been good for a few months but now it's kicking my rear.

"Hi Guys. I seem to be so anxious that I almost forget about breathing when I am in an OCD cleaning frenzy. All the adrenaline is buzzing around my body and I guess this stops me thinking rationally. My main problem is I worry I have been outside and somehow got contaminated with something dangerous, that I would do it without thinking. Sometimes I can be in the house and hear a noise and associate it with something dangerous and have to wash, another time I will have a strong mental image of something frightening (touching a poisonous plant, chemicals on my hand etc) and have to wash my hands or have a shower. There doesn't even have to be anything harmful about but the image is so strong that it feels real. An example is of being in a public toilet and worrying I have touched the sanitary waste bin which makes me wash my hands but then I will worry I have touched it again and have to wash again and so the vicious circle begins, I get more and more frightened and then cannot leave. Are we supposed to just wash once and then leave, even though we feel so uncomfortable? Of course deep down I know I wouldn't do things I don't want to do but strong images frighten me, I have a baby and wouldn't want to put anything harmful near him. Anyone out there relate?
Saying all this I do think I have made huge steps; in the past I have been scared of the toilet, dog faeces etc but now I can use the bathroom relatively happily and I can cope with dog poo. Must say avoidance is not the answer, being about a calm, happy, confident person does help. My friend (unaware of OCD) is good company, her confidence wears off on me and allows me to see what is normal behavior.
I have been reading a lot about the use of bleach, antibacterial cleaners on this forum, people using them on their skin. There have been times when I have been struck cold with fright at the thought of contamination, so frightened BUT I only use soap and water on my skin, in fact I only use hot soapy water and my steam cleaner/steam mop on the entire house. Hot soap and water is apparently the best thing to clean with, including hands. My advice is that bleach and anti bacterial cleaners are toxic and are only meant for surfaces (even then to be used sparingly.) These cleaners are aggressive and potentially harmful to health, they are not good to be breathed in, who knows what harm they can do to your lungs. The skin is an amazing organ, it has the ability to protect us but when using harmful sprays, ironically we disturb the micro flora of the skin, take the good bacteria away, strip the skin, make it bleed/crack open and therefore open ourselves up to disease, surely?
Hope I haven't frightened anyone but members of my family have clinical jobs and when I started using antibacterial products unsafely they pointed all these things out, I'm so glad they did as I want to be healthy and although I am still excessive with soap at least it is unharmful.xx","['outside', 'bathroom', 'behavior', 'Thought', 'disease', 'hope', 'OCD', 'anger', 'toilet']",['excessive'],"['outside', 'disease', 'OCD', 'anger', 'Thought', 'toilet', 'excessive', 'behavior', 'bathroom', 'hope']",,1.0,,,
"It just dawned on me this weekend that I am mentally ill, I dont think that I have actually sat down and accepted that yet, and it hit me like a whack to the back of the head this weekend to be honest.
Does it ever get better?? I know it's not going to be easy, I know that it'll take hard work, but is it really something that I need to prepared for managing for the rest of my life??
My anxieties revolve around sexual spikes, which makes the relationship with my boyfriend difficult and also makes the thought of having children very scarey.
I just feel a bit flat, like I will never have a normal family life and its something that I really want.
I'm a fighter generally, is this the right way to approach this, or should I start resigning myself to the fact that things will NEVER be the same as before I started with the OCD symptoms.
Sorry if that's depressed you!! I depressed myself this weekend with it all, I just wonder whether I am fighting a losing battle and should just give in!

"Has anybody ever had a problem with this? I feel like I get it often and it always is a trigger for me. Well not always, only since I've been on this current theme of thinking I can see the future and looking for signs and coincidences. Everytime this happens and I get this deja vu feeling I feel like its my mind telling me I can see the future or something and it causes alot of anxiety and rumination.

"Hi guys,
I need to get this out while I've got it right in my head...
Here's the deal, I'm a little bit worried with myself. OCD introduced me to a life of worry and anguish but I'm scared that I might have become so used to it I would happily take it on for the rest of my life. But it just sounds like such a bitter life and the very thought of it makes me want to turn and run the other way. But everytime I get a worry, I know it's a worry, but I have to make an extra effort to drag myself away sometimes. I get worried that I might deliberately let it in.
My brother, who also has OCD, is, I think, apparently messing up one of the best things that ever happened to him and I wonder if he's doing it as an OCD response or something because everytime good things come, I'm on edge, convinced something's going to happen to mess it up and that something will be me with my OCD thoughts and rituals. It's like this """"""""Come on, mess it up with OCD"""""""" think. Or because I'm so used to things being wrong with my life that I could keep on making things wrong.
I know how pathetic this sounds. I've always kept my head above the water; I always do something else when faced with an OCD thought but I'm scared that I might let it in because I want it there. I blame myself for what seems to be deliberate things. I just feel I have that potential inside to ruin my life and while I'm determined not to give into it, it frightens me.

Id say the last 6 month's ocd has not entered my vocabulary, but this last week and awareness of ocd ive come to realise that in denying it, ive let it slip back in without addressing it.
The themes are odd really. At one point I was worried I was a rapist, a murderer and so on...to expose myself I watched these real crimes on tv and now im obsessed with watching them. The what if I turn into.... is still there along with the anxiety.
The other is about food. Constantly on my mind. Always making up rules in my head when om going to eat or what to eat. Im not hungry at all these days but still scoffing.This as been around for so long.

"Hello All,
Ever since Thanksgiving Day Here- Nov. 23rd- I have been having the most horrible depression. I know that is what it is because of the same old symptoms. Normally I fall more into the dysthmic level. Having a constant low level depression that to me is not even really noticeable any more. So I guess this would be classified as a major depressive episode. I have lost all motivation, eating habits changing, waxing and waning depending on the day, hypersomnia, well- like I said the usual.
This time I have noticed a far increased level of irritation, I seem to be mad at the world. Almost everyone and everything makes me angry. Not to the point of me acting out so much but more I have started to avoid almost everyone in my life, friends-- family etc.. Because I just cannot be bothered by them. I am usually a very empathetic and sympathetic person but I just feel like I could not give a about anyone. I most often just want to be alone and not have to deal with anyone at all. That really is not like me at all. I actually cannot recall a time in my life when I have ever felt like this before aside from some major PMT- a day or so.
This al culminated in me having a huge fight with my Boyfriend last night about some of the MOST ridiculous things but I was just so angry about a thousand little things that really are meaningless now that I look at them objectively-- which is very hard but I have been so upset it is one of the things I try to do. I actually yelled which is something I really do not do. I then ended up crying hysterically for over an hour I was almost hyperventilating but I could not stop crying. I just kept telling him I felt lost and as though I have no purpose. I think I actually scared him because he has never seen me cry like that before in the near 3 years we have been together. I know it scared me because I felt like I was just never going to stop crying. I have had OCD for years and years and it has never made me feel this bad in this way and really my OCD has been well under control other than a little spike here or there but my panic and depression just seem to be getting worse and worse.
I don't know why I am going on about this so much, but I do feel horribly alone. Only because I have isolated myself from everyone and I feel like I cannot reach out to them now because I have been so neglectful of everyone in the last few weeks.
Can anyone relate to what I am saying at all? Any tips on how to get out of this mess. I cannot afford therapy right now which I KNOW I need desperately but since I am not working the money is just not there.
I really need help... anyone?
thank you and I am sorry to rant on... it is probably just meaningless anyway. I just hate feeling this angry and panicky all the time.

"Hello people
I remember sometime ago someone telling me, or perhaps I read it somewhere, that people who suffer from depression have a more accurate idea of what is really going on around them. Now my theory is, having used recreational drugs in the past (and not being proud of it), that happiness is very much like a drug and you miss lots of things when your naturally high on life.
When I have ‘self medicated’ in the past life seems so pleasurable which I imagine people who are naturally happy must feel constantly within reason. Though I half accept being depressed could be caused by a chemical unbalance in your brain, certainly that is what the drug companies making antidepressants want you to believe so they can remain incomprehensibly wealthy, if you have not got a happy feeling distracting you naturally then you see the world for the corrupt, evil, dark place it can sometimes be.
Perhaps OCD comes into this too? If you ruminate over things, thinking about them excessively, then you understand things better and have more knowledge making you more aware. When us depressed people are told that were so negative and see only the bad things and not the good things then remember it could just be seeing the truths because you are low on the natural happy distraction to keep you ignorant and slightly asleep consciously.
Another question. Why are there so mental illnesses these days? I spoke to an 82 year old friend of mine who told me in his day it was virtually unheard off like it is today. Now I accept that diagnosis has become more accurate but is it possible that the tests to pigeon hole different mental illnesses could be ‘manipulated’ by those in power to force more and more people onto medications to make mass population more placid and controllable? I was told by my GP that antidepressants are the second most prescribed medication, that is really shocking in my opinion. What ever went wrong for that to be the case? Perhaps modern day living has just tipped higher number of people over the edge and the drug companies simply rape the profit at our expense?
Peace...

"Well hello again. I have not been here for awhile.
I have taken a break from dating since the break up a month ago that ruint me. It has led me into depression and it is a struggle everyday. However my OCD has calmed down when it comes to the themes ROCD and POCD. Which is nice I guess.
However I have had many people asking me out on dates, but I have said no because I know OCD will attack me. So I have done some real good thinking. I have said yes to a guy tomorrow. I am not crushing on him but he seems like a good guy. Reason why I said yes, was because of exposure. My fear is doing something I am not allowed to do when dating, and not knowing it's """"""""not ok"""""""" so I dont tell him. Then my fear is, I have done something that is not okay without knowing and he should leave me. My fear is losing a person I love based on something I have done.
So my plan is to date this guy and date him by doing all the things I fear. Date him casually. Do not go in thinking he is my soulmate or I will marry him.Date him, still talk and flirt with other men, keep my men friends, still keep options open with other men etc, get to know other men if I liek them without feel guilty......things I worry about doing when I have dated before.
I thought that by me doing this, I can show myself that it's not as scary as I make it out to be.And by doing what I think is scary I also show myself that you know when you are doing something you shouldnt be doing.
What do you guys think of this exposure? I am thinking it could be mean towards the guy? But I can not fear dating anymore..","['depression', 'guilt', 'Thought', 'OCD', 'fear']",['theme'],"['depression', 'fear', 'Thought', 'theme', 'OCD', 'guilt']",1.0,,,,
"I have always hated the present time I am in. I always spend most of my day dwelling on the past and how much I miss it. I began obsessing over how much I want to go back in time once my OCD theme of being gay hit me. I used to keep going back in time to reassure my self I wasn't gay. Through-out all of this, I have been saying to myself """"""""I have changed so much. I used to be able to """"""""live"""""""" my life"""""""" (even though, this time last year I was fearing stuff like cancer, and social paranioa stuff, but it was so much more mild back then). My point is, whilst doing all of this anti-gay checking to make sure, I realised how much better my life was a year ago. It made me want to cry. I get very emotional (and some night, I cry) and wish I was the same person I was around september 2008 - March 2009.
I have moved school for the first time in my life (I was at the same school for 12 years, and then I moved with everyone else). Ever since I have been at this new school it has triggered so much """"""""negative-energy"""""""" because everyone is changing, getting girl frineds, becoming more confident, whilst I just sit there sad wanting to escape the present and go back in time to when I was a happier, more active person, and life was simpler. Just this is enough to add to my depression, but having social anxiety, very low self esteem, and H-OCD all in one, has made each day a challenge. Is this normal for an OCD'er? (I haven't been diagnosed. :S) Is that fact I want to escape from the present and re-live my life I had last year normal? I don't know what is happening. I don't care about anything any more except getting back my """"""""state of mind"""""""" and going back to when I was in New York in December 2008 and stuff. I have no hope and care for my future. I just miss my past.
Any advice? Can others relate to this?

"It's that time of the year again when I need to order some charity Christmas Cards, but I had an idea as we have so many artistic people here, and that is rather than just order standard designed cards to offer the opportunity to our members to design a festive Christmas Card.
The design should be something festive, maybe a Christmas theme, or a fun snowman or Santa image, it does not need to have any OCD reference, as we will carry that inside the card. Because we have to order a minimum of 100 packs, we may only be able to order one design, but if we have more than one submission we can review that, and save any unused designs for next year.
For those that are not artistic but want to help, perhaps you can come up with a verse for inside, a suitable Christmas greeting. It does not have to include an OCD reference, but Wobblebobble jokingly suggested Oh Christmas Day, Oh Christmas Day, but I think it is quite good.... her jokes are naff, but sometimes she does come up with some good ideas! lol
Deadline is ASAP really, so if you want to have a go just post on here, and email over finished artwork to me at ashley @ ocduk DOT org

My latest manifestation of this is the sexual orientation variety after the previous health and harm usual suspects.
The problem this time is that I have an incident from when I was a teenager to reinforce the feelings and that is a killer.
I have just started with a CBT therapist but I cannot do the exposure therapy. My sexual thoughts don't cause a spike at the moment, they happen, I try to ignore them and let them wash over me but it only seems to reinforce the feelings that I am not reacting to them and that then brings on massive depression.

"Hello all – this is my first time posting on here. I’m not sure what I’m really looking for – maybe just reassurance, or someone to commiserate with? Although I have OCD, I keep fearing that this particular issue isn’t OCD and that I’m just a horrible, horrible person.
My guilt is about crossing someone's personal boundaries, just a warning because I don’t want to upset anyone.
Years ago when I was in high school I was doing a drama project that involved """"""""kissing"""""""" another student - ie pressing our lips together and pretending we were kissing. I was a very shy student, but I was successful in drama because I was able to just fully let myself go and immerse myself in the character. During one of our performances, when I was fully in character mode and out of my own head, I was going through the kissing scene without really thinking and accidentally went in for an opened mouthed kiss instead of the fake one we'd practiced. It was completely unplanned and I was immediately like """"""""omg wtf am I doing"""""""" but my intentions don't really matter - what matters is that I violated his trust and put my tongue against this guy’s lip without his consent. We didn't say anything about it after - I was so embarrassed - but I know he told other students.
I remember now that people had joked before “wouldn’t it be funny if you just kissed for real right on stage” and he was like, half-joking, no don’t do that and I of course knew I would never do that because a) I had no desire to and b) I was not a creep (or so I thought). When it happened and I left my mouth open, it was just such a sudden accidental thing, it all happened in a split second and I didn’t think about it much until recently when I read something online and since then it’s all I can think about. He told people about it – I know because someone told my friend, and at the time I was just embarrassed like ew what a pathetic loser I am, but now I think that the fact that so many people talked about it is proof that they thought it was a grave mistake worthy of scorn – a mistake only a disgusting abuser would make. Oh my god oh my god I am so ashamed. He said don’t do this thing and then I kind of did it, accidentally but what does that matter? It still happened. I am sick.
I only suddenly remembered this incident recently, and I've learned so much about consent and boundaries since then which is why it's only now striking me how horrible - not just embarrassing - my actions were. I feel so, so guilty and I can't help thinking of myself as a predator. I think about this most of the time every single day. The only reason that I associate it with my OCD – instead of me just purely being an evil person, which I know I am – is that the thoughts I have are the same as the thoughts I had when my life was consumed by my BDD/other OCD stuff. Like the constant rumination, checking similar situations online, feeling that this means I can never be happy and that any joy in my life is false, connnnnstantly thinking about it. With the BDD I went as far as to have plastic surgery, which no one in the whole world knows about but me and the people at the doctor’s clinic. I am so alone with these feelings, but at least with the BDD stuff I could tell myself “okay, so you’re irredeemably gross – but you don’t believe that other people deserve bad lives because they are gross, so why do you deserve a bad life?” But in this case, I really do deserve a bad life.
I guess all I need is some advice on how to carry on in a way that will do the least harm to the people around me. I just had a really great opportunity come my way, and if I didn’t have this blight on my history I think I could be free to enjoy it, but as it stands I am just waiting for my life to pass by.

"I have been suffering with an eating disorder for the last 2 months, but i have now been officially diagnosed by the doctor today as having Anorexia, this hit me hard to hear her tell me this and see the words written down on the computer screen, as i was always convinced after my 2 year recovery that i would never suffer with anorexia again, but here i am now suffering and fighting with food every minute of the day, i have a low body weight but i look in the mirror and see fat, i eat a max of 600 calories a day and quite a bit of that is coffee, my health is suffering, i have very little mental and physical energy, i get out of breath, i feel the cold very badly in my toes and fingers, my heart races at random, i generally feel awful.
As a result of starving myself my OCD is a lot worse, my health anxiety is crippling, and i can't tell myself i have no reason to worry about my health as what i am doing to myself is very dangerous, i am worrying about general serious illnesses though, i.e bowel cancer, liver damage, brain damage, i just feel so scared for my life, yet i am torturing my body by not eating, i can't cope with the severe battle i am in, on one side i want to be healthy and on the other side i want be severely underweight.
My rituals with repetitions in the car and buying things is extreme, i have re bought the same coat 5 times this week because i can't get the right thoughts, it took us 25 minutes to get 2 minutes up the road in the car due to repeating parts of the journey over and over again.
I feel so unhappy and miserable, i feel like curling up and dying, because i can't fight all these problems. My mental health team are saying if i loose anymore weight then they need to seriously consider referring me to an eating disorder unit as an outpatient for re feeding programme, but i don't want to be told what to eat, i want to make changes myself but its too hard, i feel so stuck, someone shoot me, i can't cope anymore with these fights in my head.
My doctor said to me today that i need to fight this eating disorder, but i have no energy to fight, my mind and body are suffering so much i can't think clearly, it as effort just to get out of bed in the mornings, maybe i should just accept this is going to kill me, but i have 3 lovely children and my youngest is only 5 months old, she looks at me and smiles and coo's and has no idea that her mum is wasting away, i can't let this illness beat me.

"My ocd has surrounded many themes but paedophillia has been a main one. I have however over the years gotten alot better, but im now suffering the guilt of things from years ago surrounding it and feel the need to tell my partner. I used to be terrified of being aroused by children (still am,but was really bad when i was younger). I remember when i was 16 my younger cousin was around alot and i developed a terrible fear of becoming aroused by her.... So low and behold, everytime i even caught a glimpse of her i would get a groinal response. A very strong one. I remember one time it was so strong i went to my room to masterbate to relieve myself as all i could think abous during my groinal response was having an orgasm. I didnt think about my cousin during it or """"""""get off"""""""" to that.... But the thoughts about her triggered the groinal,and my need to masterbate. Sorry if this post is to in depth or offensive. I had learned in a way to deal with this, but just now the guilt of doing this is killing me and i feel like i need to tell my partner so he knows who i truly am and can decide if he still wants me as surely he wouldnt want to be with someone that evil. Anyone please advice and support needed. I hope im not judged by what i done. Im disguted enough as it is xx

"Hi there. I have wanted to write this for some time but have not known what to write or how to write it. I am so lost in the OCD right now that I cannot separate out the OCD and what is real. I am so caught up in it. It has invaded everything I do from the way I breathe, to the way I do things like type on my computer, what I look at and take notice of etc.
My thoughts for the last 3.5 years have been based around choosing the devil over Jesus and aligning myself with the devil. I have tried to fight these for a long time but just became exhausted by it and I could never beat it. I did rituals as a way to prove that I did want the devil over Jesus but I would fail everytime and so this would just reinforce my belief that I do. I feel defeated by this. I have had OCD for 22 years now and I had a thought 20 years ago that the devil was going to beat me. I forgot all about that thought for 19 years but in the last three years since my OCD has come back I feel like this thought is coming true. This is one of my fears that my thoughts I have about the future will come true. Only because some have! I don’t know how to beat it. It is so strong that I have believed this thought for a long time now. I continually have to test myself to prove I want Jesus but I can’t be bothered anymore. I suffer from bad depression as well.
Lately I have also had thoughts about harming / killing people and snapping and going crazy / insane and going on a killing spree. I feel like it is really close to this happening as I am feeling completely on the edge. I don’t know how long I can keep fighting the thoughts about harming people.
I believe the thoughts about the devil and therefore that means to me that I have acted on them, even if it is only in my own head. I don’t want to act on them though. So my reasoning now is since I have acted on these thoughts then I should act on the other thoughts about harming people as well. I don’t want to act on the thoughts about the devil though.
I am so lost and scared. Currently I am on Paroxetine, which doesn’t work for me and Lorazepam, which does work but I know in the long run is not good for me. I have become completely dependent on it and am freaking out about coming off it. In the last 3.5 years this is the only med that has provided me relief. I have tried so many medications and none of them have seemed to work. I am scared that there won’t be one that works. My psych says that there is really no other meds I can try as I have tried nearly all the SSRI’s.
I have been badly depressed for 3.5 years now too and I don’t know if I want to get better anymore. I don’t know if I want to fight this anymore. To get better first of all you have to want to and I don’t know if I want to. I did for a while but the thoughts are so hard to fight and I feel like I don’t want to fight anymore. I just want to take the easy way out.
I suffer from so much guilt over these thoughts but also think that I should. I guess I am just feeling so lost, scared, helpless and hopeless. Thanks for listening and sorry if I made no sense.

"I am hating myself right now. I am letting everything get worse and I don't know what to do. I keep telling myself I just need to get on with my life and stop being so fearful. However slowly but surely my life is getting more isolated. This may sound weird, because I cannot even work it out myself. Whenever I have the smallest suggestion of meeting someone eg family or volunteering. I get a mental image where I see myself not being able to hide that I don't care about any of them, that I will not care about what they have to say so on. I will see my facial expression and body language. That I will look like I don't want to be there. My nephew's mum text me recently to ask when I would be able to visit. I haven't been able to reply. I haven't seen him for 6 months and she sent a photo that made me feel worse.I also have fears around contamination which comes into play with my nephew. I wish I could just say yes I will be visiting, but as soon as I think about it the anxiety gets worse. I feel like I have already damaged my relationship with him.
I literally see no one apart from a group therapy session once a week. I can't reach out to anyone because when I have contact with others my brain goes into overdrive. I start going over questions analysing everything, I then start getting thoughts that they will die or their family will die. I also fear reaching out because then that feeds into my anxiety that I am attention seeking. I will question my motives. I have pulled out of everything. Like now I am isolated, but that takes away the anxiety, it is when I am around others that things get worse.
My nieces and nephew have always meant the world to me, but slowly I am ruining my relationships with them. It is not fair on them at all and I am resigned to the fact that they will feel I don't care about them anymore. Why can't I just be there for them, surely if they meant that much I wouldn't just walk away from them.
I am at a loss, I keep thinking I will start with small steps, like working on the less anxiety provoking rituals, but even that I cannot not do. Sorry I don't know what I am asking, but I just realise I am going to end up hurting those that I have spent years making sure we had a great relationship.","['Thought', 'Rituals', 'fear', 'anxiety', 'anxiety']",[],"['fear', 'Thought', 'Rituals', 'anxiety']",,1.0,,,
"Hello all, and Greetings from Argentina. I’m a male, 26 years old and I’m new to the forum, and I have to say, I’m glad a platform like this one exists for those who need it, like myself. This will be a long post. I joined because I suffer what I consider a severe case of OCD, which started a few years ago and as usual became worse over time. Now it affects my everyday life, my performance at work, my spare time, my hobbies, and what’s worst of all, my relationships. I look around my life now and there is almost no piece of it that has not been affected by my OCD, and I feel exhausted.
Let me explain myself. I am not diagnosed (yet) but I suffer contamination OCD. By contamination, I mean chemical contamination (battery acid and sulfation, bleach, pool chlorine, insect spray and repellent, hair dye, nail polish remover, all chemicals I can think of), “particles” contamination (dust, sand, rust, metal shavings, broken glass, etc.) and lots of common household and office items, like inks. Stepping outside my house is most times a traumatic experience. I want to give you some examples:
I am an engineer and I work in an environment where grease, oil, metal shavings and rust are a common thing, so this has become a nightmare for me. I have all kinds of rituals for the clothes I wear to work, never mix them with my regular clothes in any situation, for example. Never touch any of my belongings when I return from work before a long, de-contaminating shower. I don’t take anything to work other than my keys, which I wash when I return.
Last week I had to inspect a metal part and used gel paint remover, which is a very powerful chemical. I take all precautions, always wear gloves and eye protection, but it is never enough. Then my head says, “you probably got some in your clothes, and then sat down in the car!”I am currently just using my car to go to work and back, because I think it is contaminated and if I get in with clean non-work clothes everything will be contaminated.
I avoid most areas in my house because I consider they are a hazard, for example the laundry room and the room where I store my work clothes.I am constantly aware of “hazardous” surfaces, such as rusty metals, and even if I am far from those surfaces something in my head tells me I touched them, even though deep inside I know I didn’t.Every time I go out I watch out for sand, broken glass, all kinds of particles in the street. And when I return most of my clothes go to the washing machine and I have to take a shower to feel calm.
The most common everyday things like using a simple Pen makes me feel insecure. I feel I have stained my hands with ink and it will spread everywhere.
For example, if I come back home from work and bring metal shavings with me, and I don’t shower and touch my phone for example, it will get scratched, damaged, ruined. And the shavings will spread from my phone to my computer as I touch it, then to my tablet, and it never ends. The same for chemicals, sand, glass. If a glass or plate breaks in my house, I will not be comfortable in that room for a long time.
I regularly clean my phone with a wet cloth (even knowing that this is worse than any “contamination” it may have!).
My fear is, all those contaminants will spread endlessly and damage my belongings. I know it sounds weird, but I’m not really concerned about health issues, poisoning, or anything like that.
Photography is my hobbie. I have some nice gear and I haven’t used it in a long time because I fear it will damage it and it will lose its pristine condition. The same for lots of my possessions, I love technology and when I buy something new I end up not using it and storing it safely. 
Well, that is a quick summary of what I’m going through right now. I feel like I'm wasting the best years of my life, I am young and have a lot to be happy about but instead I am in huge pain, and the only ones who really know it are my closest ones, especially my girlfriend who supports me inmensely. My friends and coworkers probably do not have a clue about my suffering.I will probably be posting more experiences later on. I would love to hear similar experiences and know from people who could overcome this kind of OCD. And also, I would love some recommendations on the type of therapy I should get. I had about 12 psychoanalysis sessions last year and even though I know that’s not a lot, they weren’t any good for me.
Thank you all for reading, and sorry for my extremely long post. Also sorry for my English.

"Hey guys. It’s been a while since I’ve posted here. On Friday night I went to a friend’s house where I had drinks. I ended up leaving at around 3am. To sober up, I went to a café to drink some juice. Then at like 5am, when then sun came up, I drove a friend home. After dropping him off, I started driving to the main st. It was the time that birds started coming out, and a flock of small birds flew from a tree about ten feet in front of my car. They were flying horizontally across the street in front of my car. I hit the brakes as fast as I could, but by the time my car almost stopped, I saw one of the birds extremely close. It was so close that my car very well could have hit it, but I’m not sure. Now I’m thinking that what if the bird is suffering from injuries. These were small birds, so I don't know whether or not they are too light to be hurt like this, or if that makes it worse.
I know “hit and run” OCD is a common theme, but in this case it is actually very possible that I hit the bird (or maybe even more than one). Is this OCD given that I really did see the birds in front of me and that I came so close to them? Now I feel like I don’t deserve to be happy. Yesterday, for example, I was with some people who I just met, and who were interesting, but I couldn’t enjoy it because I felt I was a bad person and shouldn’t be enjoying anything. I don’t usually come home at 5am, and I was tired and had drinks that night, so I also think it was irresponsible of me.
I feel like everything will be ok in the world again if I know I didn’t hit the bird.","['drop', 'interest', 'OCD', 'joy']",['theme'],"['drop', 'interest', 'joy', 'theme', 'OCD']",1.0,,,,
"Hey,
Sorry for posting again! (As I am writing this I am thinking, your such a fake, your looking for attention)
I have been ill the last two days and totally down in myself. Feel very low.
I got really drunk the other night with friends and I cant remember most of the night. My boyfriend said I punched him a few times whilst he was trying to get me out the club. I feel so ashamed and just a nobody. How can I do that to someone im supposed to love? I feel like my mum and only she would do that.
He said he still loves me and new it was because I had to much drink. (Drank way to much) But why would I do that?? Can alcohol really do that? Some people say alcohol tells the truth in some people? What if this is me? What if I dont love him. Why isnt he mad at me?? I punched him in the face
I feel so bad and guilty and just so blah.....OCD got better when me and my ex split, the thoughts had finally gone. Now im with someone else and just longing to be happy, the thoughts are back. I just want to be happy, I want to be in love and I want to be with him.
The mental rituals have gone and its not bothering me as much but it still hurts. Why have they come back? What if they are true..
Just feel so low right now...

I ate some ham earlier and then freaked out when I realised there was fat around the outside of the meat, I showed my husband and friend and they both laughed because its the tiniest amount of fat, but to me thats really bad.

"Following a spike, which Got me anxious, I was wondering what s really the difference between having OCD and being in denial over whatever it is (homosexuality, pedophilia, insanity..)
My point is, for most uf us ut goes like this : I walk down the street, notice a pretty girl , feel a sort of attraction , get anxiety, ruminate and find relief in convincing myself that it's just an OCD effect.
So really what differentiates us from those people that are actually what we fear we are? for example a homosexual girl who doesn't want to be gay, notices a pretty girl, feels attracted to her, gets anxious and tries to convince herself that it was nothing meaningful but it was just her anxiety causing the feelings.
Which is it?? Maybe she too doesn't want to be with girls but nature is stronger than us, we are what we are and maybe I (like this hypothetical girl) also just need to accept the truth instead of hiding behind (H)OCD.
Is it even a real thing??(hocd I mean)

"Hi...hope this post doesn't seem too confusing. Just been reading somewhere on the site about clinical manifestations of OCD that fulfil diagnostic criteria. It said that the things people worry about are just thoughts not excessive worry about real life problems. Now I'm confused! Some of my thoughts I know are not major life issues...like worrying over some trivial purchase cos I need to get exactly the right thing. But...some of my anxiety is to do with things like if my hubby does something and I worry about it and I don't know if I'm over-reacting or not. Surely worrying about your life partner could potentially be a real life problem? Sometimes I just end up with undefined anxiety almost feeling like paranoia which affects my feelings towards him...and then this lifts and I feel better again. Also when I got really anxious for years about whether my diagnosis of ME was accurate or not...potentially, if they'd got it wrong, that's a real problem. Also, if I may have upset someone, then I need to try and put it right...if I had really upset them, then my efforts would be necessary...even though the majority of the time I'm apologising needlesly. Does this make any sense? I guess I'm just worrying cos having read that I'm thinking maybe I haven't got Pure O after all and I'm barking up the wrong tree... :helpsmilie: All I know is I wish I could switch my brain off sometimes...I wish I could get rid of all this fear, anxiety and doubt. I don't know how to help myself cos I don't know what's wrong.

"Hello
I'm new - my name is Matt & living near London. I've joined as I've never shared my experience of OCD with anyone other that the person I see for CBT.
If anone here is undergoing any CBT and Exposure Response Prevention as I would be interested to hear about it because I am finding it incredibly hard.
I've had OCD for nearly 25 years - mine traces back to contamination anxiety around BSE/CJD prion disease infection and all the anxiety responses/rituals it creates.
I can do the exposure work but the feeling of being' 'contaminated' never dissipates inline with the ERP model. I have to clean/ritualise afterwards to prevent a mass ritual getting out of hand - and it's getting worse. I'm now 40 and it's affecting my life now more than ever before.
Does anyone have any ideas maybe from their own experiences in how to do the response prevention. I'm really stuck in that doorway and I feel completely alone on this. I've got 25 years of thinking errors to try and unlearn but I'm at a point with my CBT where it is crunch time ( like they're about to say 'we can't help you anymore').
I'm on Fluoxetine 60mg and I don't think it's doing much for me.
Thanks for reading and I look forward to sharing/ hearing about your views/thoughts.

I just sendt it to a few persons on Facebook, to see the responses.. 2 at first.. one of them didn't know i had ocd.. but he was negative.. and thought he had """"""""a little ocd"""""""" as he said.. and he wrote lot of stuff like """"""""you're wrong"""""""".. i get anxious when its messy I did check the oven before..""""""""
And he thought i should be careful to write things like that of myself (i didn't tell my own rituals, and personal stuff)
and that i was to negative... and like """"""""you should just be more positive,,"""""""" And trust me; my post was NOT negative, THIS is negative.. Hes comment just made my cry, and i deleted my post on the blog.

"Hi,
To keep things brief Ive been doing really well. No google searches in about 9 months, no longer than up to half an hour ruminating on any given day etc.
Ive been challenged recently since my mother and two younger siblings had to stay with me due to housing problems. I always spike around them and try and carry on as normal.
The issue is, my younger brother (6) was abused by his dad. He now acts very inappropriately..he will try and touch us on the butt/chest etc, he thinks it's funny and his boundaries are kind of messed up. Needless to say this affects my relationship with him and plays havoc with my OCD. The other night he wanted to sleep in my bed and I let him at first. I was laying facing away from him and at first he was gently tickling my back and side. Then he slowly tried to go further down my back and down my pyjamas. I told him to stop. This happened about 3 times before I got so angry I took him in to my Mum and refused to sleep beside him. She is aware of what he is like. I didnt want to get too angry with him because it's not his fault, he is getting help, but it is infuriating when I tell him time and again not to touch me inappropriately because it's not allowed etc. Also, I was quite tired when this happened, and now I am panicking that I left it too long to tell him to stop. There may have been a groinal response (due to ocd, or whatever) but I think I left it a couple of seconds each time before shouting at him to stop. Like I didn't reat immediately or quick enough. So I could have enjoyed it momentarily and now feel I have done something, harmed him or been abusive.
It's really upset me. I love my brother and love cuddlng him but this makes it difficult. And now I feel terribly guilty like I did something bad.

"Recently I suppose I had one of my OCD nightmares come true.
I can't go into extreme detail; however the one thing that I had most feared, and been engaging in unnecessary rituals earlier this year happened despite everything I did. I often replayed this possible scenario in my head and earlier this year I had a celebration that I had got away with it, however that was premature. The cause of it was nothing to do with me but an OCD problem with a vehicle previously owned by someone being solved by the sale of that vehicle may have lead to the situation happening. I know that for 99.99% of the population, even those with various types of OCD that this would not be an issue at all, but it could get to the stage that I wouldn't be able to function in my own house.
It is similar to the idea that if someone the person doesn't like or for someone with radiation fears, if someone who works in a nuclear lab enters your house wearing the dreaded uniform that they wear at work, and you think that the carpet areas that they stood on and the air in the room is """"""""contaminated"""""""" then this is imperfect. If you hear that the person might have been to a certain store or you have seen them there then that building becomes """"""""contaminated"""""""" even though they may have only been in a small part of the building and you think that everything in that building, even in other rooms is now affected because the area where the person was and the other rooms share the same 4 exterior walls. the strategy I have used in the past if someone came to my house had c (6 letter word - rhymes with dancer) then I would open all the doors and windows in the house for at least one hour - the front and back doors would be wide open and all windows and internal doors to allow the air to be exchanged in the building to get rid of any bad air or contamination. I am planning to deal with this by opening all the doors and windows this weekend and then wetting the carpet or using washing up liquid to undo any damage that might have been caused by the person's presence. If I let the thoughts run, I feel that I might have to move house before I would feel right again, which I am not in a position to do at the moment.
What I really want to know is whether a building/room can be poisoned or contaminated by a certain imperfect person being there and if not how you know it is not possible. If any of you can suggest any magical rituals that could undo this it would be great. I could take all the carpet in the rooms up and rinse the walls with water and """"""""de-atomise"""""""" the room but I want to know if you feel that opening the doors and windows to allow the atoms and air to leave the building is an acceptable way forward.
However, I know that this person has been to a shopping centre and I can go in there now maybe 3 months later and not feel that everything in it is affected because as I was informed at a support group meeting there is basically no trace of them left in the centre because of all the people that have been there since, however the fact the they were there means that even items not in the centre then are being brought into the same building as the person was once in even though they weren't there at the same time.
If any of you have similar problems with being unable to live in certain houses because a dog once lived there or some very small and is to most others not an issue at all - if I come to the conclusion that the whole house is contaminated (touch wood it isn't) then does the fact that it is 100% contaminated mean that everything is on an even level and so is actually not contaminated. A twisted version of a glass being half empty and half full ends with the expression full = empty and I wonder if contaminated = not contaminated is permissible. This is a most huge issue for me and I am sorry for the length of this.

"I am trying to rationalise this feeling in my head and it’s driving me insane. Please note the following information isn’t pleasant. 
Whenever I go to the toilet it seems like there is an issue, especially if it involves defecation. In theory it shouldn’t be a problem as long as I mop up and pee that my autistic brother sprays in the bathroom. But there is always a problem with wiping.

"Since OCD is OCD regardless of its variation - what I am about to say might seem redundant. There is of course a huge disconnect between rational thinking and intellectual understanding and the turmoil caused by a misfiring brain. Having said that - invariably on an emotional level - one of the cognitive veracities I have difficulty in coming to terms with - particularly when 'in the trenches' - is the notion that yielding to a minor spike is less noxious than giving in to a major one (arguably yielding to the lesser spike should be worse - since it should be lower down the hierachy). I think this idea is one of the 'beliefs' that OCD thrives on - and lays the way for the endless cycle of symptom substitution - OCD symptoms morphing from one type to another. Lets say someone rewashes a fork - all right - is the action as debilitating as throwing away some expensive product because you think it might have been 'contaminated' or driving back thirty miles because you think you might have run someone over or asking to check the restaurant's kitchen because you think there may have been blood in your food? No - superficially not - but from the point of view of serving the interests of the disorder I think it's probably just as bad - and ultimately no less debilitating - because - it sets you up for all of the above. I'm not asking anyone to beat them theselves up - including myself - over these 'minor' transgressions - but from a therapeutic point of view - I think it's good to remember that OCD's MO is always 'give an inch...' The fact that the obvious - may at times - be hard to grasp - is the very fuel that OCD demands.

"I know its ocd symptoms but they are so relentless at times. Im back to the checking and washing rituals and its horrible. I am so disgusted when people are too close now, i truly believe they will pass on their filth by getting too close. Been on meds now for almost a year 40mg citalopram. The meds and counselling have allowed me to get back to work finally, but i can feel the stress building again. I do have the shiniest stove,kitchen, bathroom etc. Amazing how easy it is to fall back in these ugly traps and I know after hours of cleaning or washing that it was a waste of time.

Does anyone else have episodes of dissociation? Did you used to? Do you still now?
I haven't done this for a long time but today during group therapy I had an episode which lasted about 15mins and was terrifying.
I used to do it a lot when I first had my break down but I haven't done it in about 2 years until now. Is this a sign that I'm getting worse again?
I felt completely unreal, like I was watching the room from miles away and my body wasn't my own. As I talked it was like my voice was coming from nowhere. I ended up crying and I rememer getting my keys out of my bag and holding my horse keyring & saying """"""""I love ponies, I definitely know I love ponies"""""""" because it was something real about 'me' which I could cling to. I feel really embarassed now.
I used to carry a 'grounding object' when I was first ill, something to remind me of who I was and that I was real and part of the world. It was something I was taught in CBT.
I guess I'd better start doing that again.

I just thought I would write this evening as I am very upset. I have suffered with OCD on and off for a long time maybe twenty years and in particular my fears seem to be around hurting children. All sorts of ‘worries’ have come into my mind through this time and left me in some very debilitating states and despair. Anyway a long story short I decided to have a child despite all my fears and worries and thank God she is so healthy and amazing and I am so blessed to have her. I didn’t let my OCD stop me living my life. Fast forward a year and I’m suffering pretty bad with worries again. The issue is I got pulled into rumination about changing my child’s nappy months ago and had these thoughts and feelings images, whatever about doing something and the thought has proven very hard to shake as I’m so scared by it. I’m trying not to actively ruminate on it but I’m so scared of it and maybe I’ll clear my head if I do. Please help someone as this thought was so strong and compelling and made me believe that I am absolutely terrified. I feel I need to try recapture the thought to see what it was I thought but then I’m equally scared to do this. I’m so frightened of what this thought sequence of whatever told me, I mean why was it so convincing? Why did certain things feel familiar?

"Hello, I am new to this forum.
I have had OCD since I was a little child.
I have tried many different antidepressants which has helped about 70% with cleaning rituals; and other OCD symptoms. However, none has worked for my acute intolerance to selective sounds. Example, when I hear this particular lady whose knees clicks, I go into an uncontrollable volatile rage. I need earplugs, my loud music, or stay away from the source to prevent this unbearable outburst to certain sounds. I have many sounds that bother me and more sounds keep sprouting out; it's getting worse. I went to an audiologist and my ears are healthy. None of these sounds hurt my ears, I just experience mental torture.
I have been on other forums, and I have had a hard time finding someone else with the same issue as I had mentioned.

"We often talk here about therapy and whether the therapist can truly understand the horrors of what we experience. 
Some former sufferers do become therapists. Do they make better therapists? 
I have had lots of CBT therapy for OCD from various therapists one of whom was a recoveree from my theme, harm OCD. 
Did it make her a better therapist, more understanding, more empathic? 
It meant she certainly knew what I was experiencing, but the CBT therapy she rolled out was textbook stuff as taught her during her training. 
People have often said to me that I should train to be a therapist because I have learned and applied CBT and know what sufferers are going through. 
Well, training to become a therapist is for me not going to happen. I am 68 years old, happily retired from a successful career in business!
I think perhaps the biggest problem with some therapists is their belief that one size fits all - lack of flexibility. Just working to a set routine, a set pace. And not being prepared to amend their initial assessments because they feel they know best. 
I don't think that is formed as a result of not having themselves been a sufferer. I think it's partly their opinion, and partly a lack in understanding during training perhaps. 
I felt I was talked down to by my first therapist - and I didn't feel any attempt on his part to interpersonally connect with me, to build a feeling of confidence and trust. 
And when he determined a course of treatment - flooding, where you carry out intense exposure for long periods - I challenged that as being right for my circumstances, and he took offence. 
I was convinced he was wrong and terminated the therapy. Other therapists confirmed that proposed treatment was wrong for me. 
I think any failings in therapy aren't due to them not having been sufferers themselves.","['OCD', 'Treatment']",['theme'],"['theme', 'OCD', 'Treatment']",1.0,,,,
"Hi, I have just registered here. I am not sure if I have an OCD, but I stumbled across this site and found some things quite helpful (Like the 4 steps to self-treat your OCD; I am planning to try that tonight). Maybe I am just posting because I can't really talk to anyone else about this or maybe I'm just too bored to work. ;-) Anyway, sorry if this is the wrong place for this post and sorry if this post is too long and wordy.
I have had a slight OCD for a few years not regarding Germs and cleanliness. Especially hair freaks me out. Other things are public toilets, insects (especially cockroaches), checking doors, stoves, slight instances of claustrophobia, etc. If the toilet is dirty (even if it i just a microscopic speck that you wouldn't see unles you looked really close) I need to clean it instantly or it troubles me. It always has to be sparkling white. I used to think that is normal but noone else I know seems to bother so much about it. I excessively """"""""touch wood"""""""" even for the most remote excuses. Regarding the checking: I am quite absent minded and forgetful. I have lost keys, forgotten to lock doors, burnt all kinds of things on the stove, so maybe I just now try to be more careful. How do I know when it is an OCD, i.e. a biological problem?
What is troubling me more though these days is that I have an excessive need to pray. I have always been more of an agnostic than an atheist, but I have never been deeply religious or spiritual. I have always thought a lot about life, death,afterlife, etc, but it never bothered me so much like it does now. About 3 years ago, I had an abortion and 6 months later another one. I feel extremely guilty and am probably suffering from depression, stress or anxiety as well. Anyway, since then I have been obsessing about going to hell, being reincarnated as a cockroach or being punished in any way. I am scared that my dead children will seek me out to take revenge. I have never liked darkness but now when I lie in bed in the dark I keep imagining that I can see horrid images. I double-triple check that all windows and doors are securely locked. Anyway to come back to the OCD, for a bout a year now, I get these sudden urges to pray. I don't think there is anything wrong with prayer in general, but it troubles me since I get the feeling that if I don't pray something terrible will happen: God will punish me. To pray I need to prostrate on the ground and I always recant the same prayer in my mind. Sometimes after having gone to bed, I need to get up again to pray. I make up excuses like having to use the bathroom or getting a glass of water because I am too embarassed to admit to my husband that I need to pray. It doesn't take up too much time yet. Normally I need to pray once at least before going to bed. Mostly I try really hard to say my prayer just once but on some occasion I need to say it several times. (Up to 7-10 times, just to make sure that I haven't said it exactly six times, which could be considered as evil). At other times I keep saying this prayer as well without prostrating on the floor.
I sometimes keep having disturbing thoughts as well about harming others but I can still deal with that. At other times I feel that I need to do something absolutely disgusting to show penance for what I have done. Like lick the toilet brush, eat a cockroach, cut off a finger, etc. I resist now by telling myself that if I do any of these things, I would have crosed the thin line to insanity but I am afraid that these urges will only get worse with time.
Anyway, sorry for the long and messy post and I am sorry if it wasn't relevant to this forum.","['abortion', 'guilt', 'depression', 'anxiety', 'anxiety', 'bathroom', 'disgust', 'checking', 'Thought', 'urge', 'toilet', 'OCD', 'site']",['excessive'],"['urge', 'anxiety', 'site', 'depression', 'abortion', 'disgust', 'checking', 'Thought', 'toilet', 'excessive', 'bathroom', 'OCD', 'guilt']",,1.0,,,
"Hiya all,
I am worried that i may be suffering from more than just severe OCD. I know i have wrote about this so many times before but i am seriously worried i have some form of psychosis.
I have loads of OCD thoughts and rituals ie harming thoughts what if this happens and what if that happens etc which i can see are OCD thoughts but then i have some different kind of thoughts things to do with powers etc and what i think could be deluisional beliefs but because i believe these beliefs are real its hard 2 think they could be deluisional. I have never heard of anyone with OCD with these kinds of beliefs i am worried i may have some mild form of psychosis.
As many of you know my present psychiatrist is useless so anything he says i would not believe anyway and my CMHT don't know all of my thoughts etc.
I am scared am i psychotic?

"Dear all
I have been worrying for ages and thank goodness I have found this site to answer a few questions.
My OCD started when I was about 11. I would do the usual of checking doors and the oven to make sure everything was turned off. Since then I have been through many different guises of OCD - thinking I had done something during the times I was drunk, worrying that I was gay, and worrying that I would harm someone.
Last year I finally went to my GP about it and was referred to a councellor. I wasnt completely honest with him as I was fearful of what he would say if I told him i was having thoughts of harming people. He diagnosed me with Generalised Anxiety Disorder, but in all fairness I hadnt really told him everything so its not really his fault he didnt say it was OCD.
Since then I have had highs and lows, but my OCD is at a huge high at the moment. I get married in 3 weeks and I think this is maybe bringing the OCD on with much more intensity. I am permenantly worried that I am an evil person and often have images of harming me fiance while she is asleep - going into the kitchen and grabbing a knife and stabbing her or something. I picture it in my mind over and over again and until I read about it being OCD related I was convinced I was becoming psychotic. This morning i looked in the drawer to make sure the knives were still in the same place so to convince myself I hadnt got up in the night and gone and picked one up. When i picked one up to make sure the one beneath it was the knife I thought it was I instantly got the image of stabbing my fiance in my mind again. It scared the hell out of me.
Reading the posts on this forum all day today has shown me that I m clearly suffering from OCD, but I am equally scared cause i dont do any of the """"""""checking"""""""" or rituals that you would associate with it. This is worrying me that maybe I dont have OCD but am infact crazy. I am also worried that when I think about hurting someone do i find it a turn on? When reading about someone elses fear of harming their children, I am sure I felt a """"""""twitch"""""""" in my groin area, which led me to imagine the scenario over and over again to see if I felt the """"""""twitch"""""""" again. This is really freaking me out.
I am sure that anyone else who is realising they have an OCD related problem such as this, always has the fear that they actually dont have OCD and that they are indeed someone capable of harming someone else. But then it also seems that if anyone really did want to harm someone they wouldnt be worrying about it and instead would just do it. My head is so messed up.
Please help me. Please!!!!!!","['Anxiety disorder', 'anxiety', 'anxiety', 'kitchen', 'Rituals', 'checking', 'Thought', 'fear', 'OCD', 'site']",[],"['anxiety', 'kitchen', 'site', 'Anxiety disorder', 'fear', 'checking', 'Rituals', 'Thought', 'OCD']",,1.0,,,
"Hi I'm 16 years old and I've been dealing with whatever this is for over two years now if not longer. I know none of you can actually diagnose me but I'd like to hear some feedback.
i am very unorganised , and I don't exactly care if my room is a mess and I don't care about germs or washing myself repeatedly but I have a serious problem with performing rituals in my head or physically, for example; I blink and twitch my eyebrows, nose, shoulders, toes and feet (not all at once, those are just triggered areas) a certain amount of times (usually 15) to a certain rhythm until I get it """"""""just right"""""""" but I have no clue what """"""""the right way"""""""" is which is incredibly frustrating. 
Sometimes if I'm reading , a certain word or sentence will stand out for me (for no reason whatsoever) and I'll repeat it in my mind over and over again till I'm satisfied. 
I also have this certain noise that I make all the time , I can't describe it but it can be disguised. it kinda sounds like """"""""hmm"""""""" and I know that sounds crazy I hate talking about this one in particular because it's the one I do most often and it's just plain weird but I always feel literally compelled to make that noise, sometimes in between sentences and people have pointed it out to me before which is so so embarrassing 
And lastly, this is something I'm becoming very worried about because it's quiet new for me and has only developed in the last few months, but when I get really angry or frustrated I feel the need to hurt myself and I get the urge to punch and hit myself in the face, and when I do give into these urges it's almost like relief.

"Hey my name is Devin. For almost my entire life (I'm 21 now), I've noticed I've always taken significantly longer than others to complete tasks. Up until now I'd conclude that I simply like to do things in a thorough, neat, and systematic manner and that's just the way I am. It would periodically cross my mind that I have OCD but I never sought a professional to diagnose it because I didn't think it was serious and pressing enough to do so, I wouldn't want to cost my parents more money, etc.
I find myself constantly straightening things up: nearly everything in my room is arranged parallel/perpendicular to the walls. I often clear the history on browsers, messages and recent calls on my phone, and calculations on my calculator because I feel a sense of clutter otherwise. I also notice I count multiples of 3 in my head until 33. And once I start at 3 I can't stop until I hit 33. If I pass 33 I must continue until 66 or 99. When I'm writing I obsess over the neatness of the handwriting. When completing school assignments I feel that excessively check my answers to make sure there are no errors and that my writing has no grammar, capitalization, etc. errors. This probably sounds like a good thing, but I think the extent to which I do it (especially when doing it for every calculation in a problem with a series of calculations) can be a bit too much. These are just the first symptoms that came to mind out of others I have not mentioned.
The reason I am finally deciding to open up about my believed-to-be condition now and finally do something about it is because I now realize how consuming it can be and how it can have a toll on various areas of my life. For as long as I can remember, I've always felt like I spend an unbelievable amount of time on my school work. I feel so unproductive as I spend probably 2 hours on assignments that my classmates probably only spend 30 minutes on, perhaps even more extreme than that. Now, as a mechanical engineering major taking classes that require a lot of studying time for anyone, I feel this issue even more profoundly. It feels as if I'm always racing against time. It's stressful because I'm always trying to catch up in my classes and I end up not having the time to do the other things in my life I'd like to: prepare healthy meals and lift weights, hang out with friends, etc.
Again, I've never been diagnosed with OCD but I believe these symptoms point directly to it. Family and friends lightly joke about my neat freak tendencies but I take no offense to it. I don't experience panic attacks or anxiety or anything like that. Essentially, I won't freak if someone comes in my room and moves my things around. I'll simply just straighten them up. Thankfully, my believed-to-be OCD is probably not too severe and likely treatable. This is the first time I've ever considered it seriously and the first time I've ever communicated these symptoms to anyone. I'm sure there are people out there that will relate and resonate as they read this. My hope is that someone here can relate to that feeling of spending ample time working, studying, etc. but not getting much done. My main concern and the main thing I hope to get out of treating this condition I believe to have is to be able to study more efficiently and free up time for other areas of my life.","['anxiety', 'anxiety', 'hope', 'OCD', 'writing', 'symptom']",['excessive'],"['anxiety', 'OCD', 'writing', 'excessive', 'symptom', 'hope']",,1.0,,,

"Yesterday, I had a fairly ordinary day, with a nice sociable meal in the middle, quite active. But on the long drive home from the meal, I noticed I had a phrase repeating in my head. It's been happening for days (three syllables, two stupid words I wont bother repeating here), and it really bothered me enough to try Google for an answer to why it happens. I keyed in 'repetitive phrases in head' and things like that. I was shocked to read it might be something to do with OCD, something I never imagined.
The more I've thought about it overnight, the more I'm convincing myself that's what it is.
My history is that I'm 38, and have had depressive moments all the way from my teens - the worst being about 10 years ago, when I was treated for 'acute depression' after admitting suicidal thoughts to my GP. I had counseling and mild tablets for six months or so and it flattened my mood enough to feel 'normal' for ages. But depressive thoughts cloud me all the time, and I recently wondered if I was manic or not (I don't really think so, I don't get long 'highs'). I should say that I only recognised true depression in myself 10 years ago after hearing Spike Milligan talk on the radio, and reading the book he did. A lot of the same patterns were there. Another element of my 'mental life' is that I have synaesthesia - I hear sounds and music as colours and textures, and smells too. I don't mind that, and have helped in research programmes with it. In other words, I don't imagine the synaesthesia, I've had tests that prove it!! I'm an artist and writer.
Anyway, the more I've read about OCD, the more I'm interested, because it matches my mindset so much. I always have thought that it meant washing, touching things, etc. But it more accurately means any mental pattern (am I right??). The most obvious symptoms I have are mental repetitions. the earliest I can remember was when I was about 10. A little 2 second phrase of the Muppett Show theme (!!!), kept repeating over and over, for days. Though not constant, it was very distracting. There have been many others, often with a visual aspect. It seems to happen most in times of stress. The phrase from yesterday was the last straw - 'why, after a normal day, am I bothered by this phrase?' - and here I am on this forum!
I have had some superstitious thoughts too - sitting on the left side of an aeroplane ever time, and being convinced that my luck changed (good or bad) every time I heard a certain piece of music, that's lasted over ten years, that one (but these are fairly normal I think). I remember at school, during a bad time, I had to touch the top of every (Dungeons & Dragons) figurine before I left in the morning. That's the only traditional one I can think of. I get fairly obsessed by things. I also get very anxious thoughts of violence/accidents in everyday life am worried about people I love getting harmed, it's like a sort of mental flash. It means I find myself feeling troubled all the time. I could go on, but would really, really like to know what you think.","['shock', 'Suicidal', 'interest', 'symptom', 'OCD', 'depression', 'Suicidal thoughts', 'Thought']","['spike', 'theme']","['Suicidal', 'Suicidal thoughts', 'shock', 'depression', 'interest', 'Thought', 'spike', 'symptom', 'theme', 'OCD']",1.0,,,,
"Hi, My name is Marcus and Im 19 years old. English is not my first language so plz dont flame me for my bad english.
Recently I have been experiencing a quit wierd problem. I excessive swallow for some reason (I swallow so it make a sound) Its like I always have some wierd urdge to swallow and cant resist it. It often are wors in the mornings and sometimes it dosent bother me that much (especially when I dont think about it). I remember how it all began, my mouth fulled up with so much saliva so I needed to spit it out or swallow it. First i did not care so much but it would not go away. On a bad day I nearly spend all day thinking about this ridiculous problem. Now I even swallow without the excessiv saliva because of some strange pressure building up or that I feel like I need to. When I swallow frequently it builds up air in my stomach and it hurts so much =(. It causes me to blech or burp, not that funny. And if I burp to much I destroy my theeth because acid (at least thats my explanation.)
I googled this problem and I found out that the problem was quit normal. It says it due to anxiety. But I really dont think I got anxiety, I got no other symptoms of anxiety..
Another alternativ I have been thinking about is LRP(a form of acid reflux). It says you can get excessive swallowing from this? I got some other symptoms that match LRP like thickle in throat, mucus sensation, lump in throath etc, metallic wierd taste in mouth in the morning. Im going to the doctor soon to check if i got this but my mind is keep telling me that acid reflux is not the problem. Because i can forget about it and it get worse when I think about it. My theory is that I developed these acid reflux symptoms from all the air building up in my stomach from swallowing.
So my question is do you think this is a OCD? And if so do somebody els got this problem and how do you deal with the stomach pain, tooth pain and all other symptoms? And is it possible to develope acid reflux from something like this? And is it someway to cure this? Its really enoying tbh.

"Do I sound like I have SO-OCD (sexual orientation OCD). One of the users implied that this isn't OCD but that I could genuinely be a lesbian or bi! I'm really freaking out and regretting coming on this site.
This is what I posted on my previous post. I'm worried that I'm a lesbian or bi. I've had this theme for years! I'm a 29 y/o female. I was triggered by watching Pretty Little Liars; one of the main characters is a lesbian. Right now I feel very stressed as I've been mentally testing being naked with and kissing a girl and asking myself am I attracted to the female body? It's like I'm not disgusted by these thoughts (I don't know if it's desensitization- I used to be super grossed out) and it's like I'd actually want to do it and have these desires. Are these """"""""feelings"""""""" and """"""""desires"""""""" false? I keep digging and digging when I mentally test to try and gauge every reaction. It seems like I desire it when I mentally test but I don't.
I know there's nothing wrong with being a lesbian or bi but I don't want to be one. I don't come from a religious family; my mum is very liberal and I live in a liberal LGBT friendly society. I have a friend who recently came out as a lesbian but she's so happy whenever she talks about women; her face lights up and she's excited about dating women. Her mum doesn't know and is homophobic, but my friend is open about her sexuality to everyone apart from her mum. I have no desire to date women and whenever I mentally test, I feel so low and depressed; you'd think I'm thinking about something horrible but my mind convinces me that I """"""""enjoy"""""""" it and really desire women. Do you ever get this? Does OCD try to convince you that you're into something that you're not.

"Ok so horrible thought comes in...I finally realise it's ocd and know I am not to blame
Then more thoughts follow..memories of what a person posted on a forum about what they feared they did
But I feel this safety inside of me that OCD would not defeat me this time, I would never do what they did, it couldn't trick me this time
Now with that feeling of confidence for once after years of battling ocd thoughts, I felt calmed down and on top, like I just defeated the monster, as though I was standing opposite it...but i suddenly had this wall around me...that I knew it wouldn't break for once. I didn't have to fear it.
Therefor I was able to feel kind of normal and good about things.
Now I feel like I let this wall crumble a little, because I felt like I was stronger than OCD anyway...I let my guard down.
I had thoughts coming in around what that person feared they did. Then I found myself thinking, how would they do it, I won't but how, is it even possible, etc etc, all these things flooded in, I thought I was OK to think or ponder because I knew myself that I'd never do it. Its the last thing I'd want. I felt this 'novelty' Feeling of power over ocd. I have not felt like that in years. More thoughts came...I kept thinking so if someone did that they would be doomed forever, how easy is that, surely it's not so easy? Etc etc
I snapped out of this and tuned in and thought ok, OCD is trying to find something to make me panic. I know I'm OK though.
Then I felt myself picturing being close to acting, and I started to move my lips slightly (i have a fear of speaking a thought outloud against religion under a breath) I then thought. OK this is gonna make me worry later, check I haven't said anything...I replayed everything and was certain all was OK. It still won't get me.
I was relieved once more. Glad I hadn't 'messed up'
I moved away then suddenly felt this breath come out... And because I wasn't picturing it or focused it's now saying thats enough to doubt. As it was coming out I felt this spike and foggy doubt.
I feel like I let this happen, or caused it.
I don't want to have done anything wrong, it's the last thing I'd want.

"Hello everyone,
First of all I want to apologise for my bad English (it's not my native language). Also, I would like to thank you for taking time to read this and for any advice and reply. 
Now I would like to talk to you about my (possible) OCD. I believe I've been living with POCD for a year and a half. My symptoms seem to match the ones described on OCD forums.
However, there are certain things that make me believe it's more than OCD. For example, I never had physical anxiety, and if I did it was probably very mild. However, I do worry about my theme almost every day. (As I'm typing this I feel calm, maybe a little anxious, and I don't like this...)
For the past weeks I've been having really strong urges, which I believe are not a representation of OCD but the real thing. Also, it seems that they can last for a very long time (which worries me even more), even for an entire day. 
Another thing is it seems that I'm actually distressed because I can't act on these thoughts (I'm not sure if this is what I really feel and hope it's actually distress caused by thoughts). 
I've been thinking about these thoughts every day for the past 6 months, and sometimes it feels like I do not want to get rid of them, and I do enjoy living with them. Also, I can't recognise my own thoughts, and don't know what is real and what is not.
To be honest, everything I've written doesn't fit in the OCD category, but in the real one. 
I would like to know your opinions, and I apologise for any discomfort or trigger caused.","['anxiety', 'anxiety', 'urge', 'representation', 'hope', 'joy', 'Thought', 'OCD', 'symptom']",['theme'],"['urge', 'representation', 'anxiety', 'OCD', 'Thought', 'joy', 'symptom', 'theme', 'hope']",1.0,,,,

When i do go out i often feel that quite a few people do not think much of people who seem nervous, and i get hurt inside throughout the time that i am out in the big bad world because of this. I was just wondering if other people also feel this way, and also does anyone fancy explaining how they cope?
p.s. i particularly have a lot of trouble with eye contact, and obsessive ruminations about how to cope with this problem and how to 'be' with other people - this goes on all the time i am out - again if anyone has advice i would appreciate your efforts.

"My experience is .... no, they don't.
I find talking about my OCD, or even saying I have OCD very difficult and always try to hide it due to past negative reactions I have had from family, close friends, college lecturers etc.
Whenever I try to mention it to family or friends, even now they change the subject immediately. The only person, that has ever tried to understand it and is patient about it is my Mum. My ex, understood it and then got fed up with it too, which in a way I understand as it's not easy being around someone 24/7 who has OCD.
I've had OCD for 22 years and not long after I was diagnosed my oldest friend caught me out washing my hands and saying mantas... I was concentrating so hard on what I was doing that I didn't hear her come up behind me. Yes, it was VERY embarrassing. About 10 years later a similar thing happened and I couldn't get away from the kitchen sink, to which she stated angrily, ''I feel like shaking you''. Recently she asked why I don't talk about my OCD....so I tried, but she wasn't actually interested and dismissed it. I then found out what I'd told her in confidence she'd passed on to her brother because when he next spoke to me on the phone he was laughing about it. Her response, when I said ''Thanks a lot for laughing at me behind my back'' was..... ''I told him not to tell you I'd said anything''. Well, that's alright then, isn't it... no.
On the rare occasions that I have mentioned my OCD people either
don't want to know and change the subject straight away ... or as in my case say, ''Got to go now'' as my cousin did a couple of days ago...
call it a whim and dismiss it... which I find deeply insulting as a whim does not ruin a persons life as OCD has mine
or react angrily and say I should just ''shake it off'
A college lecturer once told me I should not be on the course if I had OCD when I explained my OCD to him because I'd missed a class.
I have been made to feel like a freak for having OCD for the past 22 years. The only time I didn't feel like a complete freak was when I was in an Anxiety Disorders Unit and realised there were lots of other freaks like me.

"My mum thinks beating OCD just involves going to social clubs and less time on an iPod. She is signing me up for all these things and then she says nearly every day """"""""You need to make an effort"""""""". She doesn't know that even if I do a 100 things I will still have these thoughts. Now if I try to tell her about more OCD themes, she will just start rambling about """"""""Effort"""""""" and """"""""Busy"""""""".
It is not my fault the people in my class never invite me anywhere. I spent 60 on makeup and nail polish in the hope that somebody might say """"""""Want to come over?"""""""" I signed up to Instagram but left because everybody else was invited to some party or gathering and I become depressed. I sucessfully gave away about 50 worth of that junk last night to my sister.

Even the slightest hint of an intrusive thought or doubt can change my mindset to depressed but I wonder how much is true guilt?

"Hi,
I've been getting these feelings lately which I can only associate with guilty feelings only a bit wierder.
I'm a lone parent so its natural that I feel the pressure especially because I work too and money is tight too, I'm sure many people can relate. But I get very uncomfortable feelings when I do something or don't do something, for example, in the media I always hear that we shouldn't drive as much, we should recycle more, do more excersise, eat more healthily, be clean at home, dress a certain way, be a certain weight, have your children acheive this and that and get so and so grades etc, you get the drift.
All I hear is how things should be, so I strive to do the best that I can. I eat quite healthily, I do a certain amount of excersise everyday to keep my body in shape(which a lot of the time I feel too unwell and tired), I try to do activities with my son (which most of the time I'm too shattered to do), I cook fairly good meals (which I'm usually too shattered to do), I try to help my son with home work (by which time I'm too tired in the evening to do), i read with him by order from his teacher (which I'm usually too tired to do more than 5 minutes), I usually walk to collect my son from school (but lately I get so knackered I just drive), If I drive to collect him I feel guilty for using unnecessary petrol and causing more damage to the environment. Honestly I could go on an d on. Why am I being told to live a perfect life that is so hard to acheive, then I end up feeling really bad because I can't acheive them. Its impossible to keep up, its ok for a while but how perfect am I expected to be.
I'm just beating myself up all of the time. I feel that I'm letting my son's education down and that the teachers think I'm flipping useless because all the other kids have two parents living with them and can do well in homework assignments.
I know its a long one! Sorry. I'm a bit fed up today and feeling really under the weather as always.
To make matters worse I work in a hospital with patients so I always get minor illnesses and this week I was told that 14 days off in a year is excessive, so I feel that things aren't going well there either.

If I have had a bad dream, it affects my OCD.
Everytime I get the urge to carry out a ritual, a bad thought from the bad dream will come into my head, making me do the ritual. When I really really didn't want to.
The thoughts from the bad dream will go away after a while, but then when it happens again, it's horrible. Because I find it very hard to resist doing my rituals anyway.

I'm just wondering if anyone ever suffered from or heard of the symptoms I have? I've sufferd from some form of OCD or """"""""pure O"""""""" my enire life, as far back as I can remember. I've just never heard of anyone else having the thoughts I have.
It started out when I was a child and needed an object, often a toy, to circle my enire life around. I needed to have it whith me always and where ever I went, it """"""""was supposed to"""""""" occupy my enire existence.
After a while (when I got older) the object changed to a subject or a theme that """"""""should"""""""" be the center of my existence and give me meaning. It changed from """"""""animlas in general"""""""" to """"""""dogs"""""""" to """"""""books"""""""" and sometime specific books, during one time it was another world I created i my head. I needed to learn everything about the subject, the subject was """"""""me"""""""", nothing else mattered. Not what I dressed like, not personal hygine, not other people.
During the end of high school I finally got over this. But now (I'm 21 years old) I don't know who I am since I always before have """"""""been my subject"""""""". Now I instead obsess about what style i should have, what I should be like and what I sholud do with my life. I also have a real problem with things changing. I want everything to be static.

"Hi. I am new here and have been considering posting for a while - have finally taken the plunge as it would be nice to talk to others with my condition as have never met anyone else with it! I am 28 years old and have been suffering with this for over 20 years and it affects my life in all kinds of negative ways and makes my life hell most of the time frankly. What I find strange is my OCD doesn't just have one theme, I have many different themes going on all at once which strikes me as unusual as most seem to just suffer with one main theme.
Anyway, there is this one constantly re-occuring theme I have been suffering from for years and I am not sure what to call it. I'll give you an example and see if anyone else can relate.... If say for example I am sitting in my armchair and have a bad intrusive thought my mind then tells me that the thing I am looking at is then contaminated, for instance if I am watching TV in my mind the TV is contaminated and I struggle to watch it again. Or if while having a bad thought I see my CD player I then cannot easily go to play a CD because i feel that it has been contaminated by my bad thought and it is somehow """"""""ruined"""""""". If I try to ignore it then the next time I go to play a CD it just pops up again that it is """"""""contaminated"""""""".
This kind of OCD is one of the worst things I have to deal with and happens pretty much all day every day which as you can imagine is so exhausting and it causes me to not be able to do a lot of things I enjoy as most things have now been contaminated in my home. I have come to close my eyes a lot of the time as If I see nothing when having a bad thought then it cannot be contaminated an it is just easier. I have almost tripped over even in the past due to having my eyes closed while walking. This happens whether I am in my house or outside.
Does anyone else have anything similar to this """"""""mental contamination"""""""" thing? It can also affect me a lot in the sense of I have to keep washing to try and get rid of the contamination caused to me due to the bad things that pop into my head. It is an extremely strong feeling which I cannot seem to shake and is really really awful. Just wondering if anyone else has had to deal with anything similar and for some advice if possible?

"Hi All,
I have been reading alot of peoples topics and I wanted to start one of my own by asking I know we all have ocd and the most common thoughts of harm are to other people loved ones, family, animals etc. I had thoughts of harming my children and then it went onto thoughts of harming myself.
I just wondered does anyone have this fear or is it just me because in the past I have had handwashing forms of ocd, checking, rituals which I still have and obsessive thoughts which are my main thing now. My thoughts are triggered off by reading about someone who's committed suicide in any way shape or form and depending on what mood I am in I then start the what if cycle would i do that to myself or what if i lost it and i did that to myself......etc You know what I mean sometimes I have had images when I have seen ropes and I still don't feel 100% around them or Knives but it's much better than it used to be.
I am now pregnant well 26wks and am expecting a baby girl i am taking citalopram 40mg daily and the doctor that I see occassionally at the mental health centre said i was most likely to get thoughts or harming my baby again but he doesn't make much comments about the thoughts i have had of harming myself but then maybe that's because i know if i was someone else talking to me i'd be saying look they are just thoughts that's all but hey it's easier said than done isn't it.
Thanks for reading

"Hi all
Oooh...first post...very exciting!
I am a student at The University Of Sheffield studying Music. I was diagnosed with OCD 2 years ago when I was in my final year at school. I am currently doing a project about whether I can successfully use music to distract myself from performing some of my everyday rituals.
I was just wondering if anyone would be willing to mention whether they have used/considered using music as a distraction. Also has anyone had music incorporated into their therapy?
Any information about how people use music to help themselves in their fight against OCD would be great! I wouldn't mention any names or anything.

"I love Frozen. I can't help but get the feeling though that the character Elsa is a character with an anxiety disorder; possibly OCD. I know children's films often have subliminal themes like this which are aimed at making children more accepting of those with differences. Here is why I think Elsa has OCD:
Elsa has this secret thing that makes her different (her power to freeze things) and all her efforts go into hiding this from everyone and hidig away from everyone, even her sister who she loves, for fear of hurting people. All her efforts go into concealing her power because she's afraid she'll hurt people (even though that only makes it worse), she even runs away and hides on a deserted mountain!
Whilst on this mountain alone it gives her momentary relief but the instant she's faced with the fear of hurting other people again she completely panics and freaks out, this only makes things worse. She wants so badly to be with her sister and go back to how they were as kids but her fear overwhelms the things she actually wants.
In the end what seems to make things better is Elsa allowing herself to be around her sister Anna (so this would be stopping her avoidance behaviour), the moment she stops avoiding her sister and tells her sister she loves her she finds she can control her powers.","['Anxiety disorder', 'anxiety', 'anxiety', 'Avoidance behavior', 'OCD', 'fear']",['theme'],"['anxiety', 'Anxiety disorder', 'Avoidance behavior', 'fear', 'theme', 'OCD']",1.0,,,,

"Hi
I've just been chatting to my parents about all things OCD when my mother mentioned some of the strange rituals her sister has. I remember going to her house as a kid and seeing all the canned food lined up neatly on the shelves with all the labels facing to the front.
Also, when she goes anywhere in the car, she will always take the same route, regardless of it's the quickest way or not (this is the same if she is walking through town).
When she visits her local supermarket, she takes the same route, stopping to pick up a particular brand of cake before putting it down to buy what she wants.
Do you think this is OCD or just ritualistic behaviour. Is there a genetic link with sufferers?

What I've noticed though is how comforting the thoughts can be. Even though they hurt me and I know they'll make my day a nightmare, obsessing over my ex just makes me feel warm. It's not that it's love, it's more about the desire to have affection, and my OCD grabs onto that and tortures me. So this is probably a stupid question, but it's aimed at anyone with OCD.

"Hello
Just a quick question, i am currently trying to learn more about ocd and how it happens, what it does ect.
Was just wondering if ocd makes us see things differently to other people? Are we unique or is it just anxiety that blows our thoughts out of all porportion?
At the moment my ocd is making me check things in fear i might go mad, like i could see a person and think they look like someone but if i cant remember who they look like i start to search my mind for information, is this rumination?
Same thing wth songs or peoples names, if i cant remember and inn just stuck with there face or the song in my mind i have to solve the puzzle so to speak.
Had an assesment with my local CMHT yesterday and they are referring me to see someone. I just really want to learn more about it so when it happens I understand. Cant quite sepereate my ocd thoughts from normal ones at the moment as my head is like a big jumbled mess, and everything causes me anxiety!

"Hi there. 
While my OCD is so much better after a long time of really challenging it, 80% I would say, I do have reminents that seem to flare up from time to time. 
Recently I can’t seem to help my mind plunging into events from the past, like years and years ago from when I was at school more or less and constantly analysing if my behaviour in the past was good or bad and what this means for me as a person. It’s almost involuntary it just happens and fills me with this spike of anxiety and I end up ruminating over whether I have done something in my past that could somehow affect my future. I don’t believe I have but I’m worried my mind will start twisting memories to make me believe this is not the case.
I have been diagnosed with OCD in the past and had CBT although this was not a theme I ever suffered from. 
Could anyone advise if this is a common OCD theme? And if so does anyone have any good reading material or exposure exercises they could recommend to combat this?

"Okay, so I recently finished Brain Lock by Jeffrey Schwartz, and I read a part in there, where it said that people who suffer from OCD tend to be less emotional, or something along those lines, because we are constanly occupied with our thoughts and rituals.
But I've also been reading on these boards that we who have OCD, are sensitive people. Would anyone enlighten me? I just feel like stone. I didn't cry when my grandfather died, and some family members have commented how I am emotionaly insensitive. It hurts me, because I don't really think of myself that way, I just don't let it out like a lot of others do, but then they could very well be correct, because I don't seem to feel pain, other than my own and those who suffer from OCD..... its weird
Could it be that I don't have patience for the majority of people who don't suffer from some medical ilness? Since they're usually quick to jump to conclusions and judge us upon them. It does get irritating, I can't expect them to understand, but try to believe us heh
Maybe I don't care for people who don't suffer? I'm really just shooting stuff out there :/

"Just an example of how ocd affects me. 
I'm doing something normal... Then the intrusive thought comes in.... 
I either freak out and freeze or...
I say no come on its ocd and I try and prove it wrong...
But whatever I do it says - you just did this...or that...and then says well why did you make that movement, were you acting on it, what does this mean etc.
Then I think why didn't I just freeze and block the thought, what was I trying to do, then it spirals and I believe I acted on the thought in that moment.
So if I freeze I'm trapped and if I try to be normal it says I'm evil. It makes me analyse every single movement and says its all acting on the thought and why would a good person do that. 
I just felt it moments ago with something else,  I can't even remember what, but I felt like in that moment I was wondering why I was responding in the way I did.
It sees something tiny as a horrible test. Then I have all this niggling doubt.. Have I done wrong, have I remembered it correctly.
It's like a big ball of confusing doubt. 
I see how quickly I can go from being relaxed to being totally confused by a thought and within moments I'm suddenly analysing what I've done in a single moment. 
It comes out of the blue, no warning. 
Unfortunately the time it got me all those years back has stuck in my head and been a constant rumination for years that changes so much. 
My ocd in that moment was around the fear of....""""""""speaking a thought under my breath and not knowing I'd said it""""""""
So I'm minding my own business, this horrible thought comes in, I try to cancel it out and say the opposite, which in turn triggered this whole thing of """"""""what if I spoke it under my breath"""""""" and so on, until I came face to face with it, is it possible to speak, testing to see if it was, then worrying why I was testing, trying to fight it and not run away, then analysing everything I'd done...down to the tiniest of motions. 
It's like I get the thought is it possible to speak when breathing, I automatically test to see, I realise what is happening and panic a little, I see sense and tell the ocd to go away and that im doing nothing wrong, OCD doesn't like this so it tries another angle...what if you spoke half of it, I feel on edge once more, I say no! But then find myself moving my mouth again, I panic, I replay it, no its fine, I walk away from it... I avoid it and distract myself and BOOM the first sign of breath that I haven't monitored and I fear I've made a mistake and I'm evil and it's all my fault.

"I'm used to dealing with my other OCD hangups and I am quite certain they are just OCD whether than being reality (or, as certain as I can be :roll:). I cycle between homosexual fears and relationship fears. This has been going on for 5+ years. For about 2 years now, I suspect I've added religious fears into the mix.

I have to give back story and all that because I am horribly distressed and I like to complain. When I started college, my belief in Christianity already was pretty weak. Looking back on my life, it was always pretty shallow. I'd have moments of intense emotions with praying, but other than that I never felt like I was comfortable with a lot of the things the religion taught. I could never see the justice or love in God damning people of other religions/those who had no religion. I couldn't deal with the hateful, murderous things God would do in the Old Testament....all the usual issues that many people cite when they question their belief.

My major in college was....philosophy and religion. That was really the nail in the coffin. I studied other religions and many of them, specifically the Asian religions, spoke to me far more than Christianity did. The main professor of the program was unfortunately a Calvinist and the hate that I had for that man, and still have, distanced me from Christianity even more. Alongside this, 2 years ago I started dating the most wonderful guy, who happens to be agnostic. That also quickened my distancing from my old faith.

I have some days, many in fact, where I am fine with not being Christian. When I'm okay, I consider myself a deist. I have other days with EXTREME levels of fear and guilt. Sometimes I am afraid to sleep at night because I'm waiting for God, if he does exist, to show himself and talk to me. I'm afraid that I've done the wrong thing and that I'm going to hell. I spend a lot of time on the internet researching religious matters, getting on forums, etc, and much of what I find makes my issues worse. Much of what I read are things like: """"""""you're going to hell, save yourself before it is too late"""""""", """"""""the devil is working on you."""""""" I'm waiting for the day when I start to fear I am possessed on a regular basis.

Deep in my heart I feel like that if God were real, good people couldn't go to hell. But then, I hear what my old professor, family members, and old preachers would say about that thought. """"""""There is only one way to be saved"""""""", """"""""Those who reject God will have God reject him"""""""", and all that. These lines circulate in my head repeatedly when I have these spells of anxiety.

This is all particularly distressing for me because of my boyfriend. He is very reasoned in his belief and he is comfortable with who he is spiritually. This is where the religious fears mix in with my pre-existing relationship fears. Because I am so confused and constantly being tormented with this Christianity thing, I'm afraid I really still believe and I am lying to myself (this is a constant pattern of thinking for me - when I'm not worrying about religion, I will think that I don't really love my boyfriend and I'm lying to myself). Then, this leads to thoughts like """"""""If I am still secretly Christian, God condemns my relationship"""""""", """"""""My boyfriend is going to hell"""""""", and """"""""Satan is using my boyfriend to lead me astray."""""""" I also judge the morality of boyfriend CONSTANTLY. I know that he is a genuinely great person - far better than 99% of the population - but the smallest things will lead me to think he's an """"""""evil unbeliever."""""""" It's all ridiculous.

I think this has flared up because my grandfather unexpectedly died last week and I went to his church service. I hadn't been to church in probably 3 years and much of the rhetoric outraged me.

To make a long story short, I don't know if what I am experiencing is normal of scrupulosity or not. I don't think it is, but most of what I've read about scrupulosity is about people who are definitely Christians who pray obsessively, repeat rituals, and etc. I don't do those things. Thank you for reading this, if you've made it this far. I just want some input. If you have the same problem, sharing would always be appreciated. I know I am long due for a psychiatric visit, but I live in a rural area in the American South, and I doubt the professionalism of many therapists around here. I know the chance of someone telling me to find God in order to heal myself is high. I'm afraid of what that would do to me.","['guilt', 'anxiety', 'anxiety', 'Rituals', 'OCD', 'Thought', 'fear']",['obsessive'],"['anxiety', 'obsessive', 'fear', 'Thought', 'Rituals', 'OCD', 'guilt']",,1.0,,,
"Hi everyone, I'm quite nervous about giving this information but I wanted to know if any of you identify with this. It's a long read so thank you if you read it!
I'm a 20 year old female and when I was 10, I started to randomly remember things from my childhood. It caused me a lot of guilt and worry but they weren't things that children would probably worry about. It even got to the point where one day at school I was so distressed that I was on the verge of dehydration and had to be taken home. I felt like I had to confess these memories and my thoughts (even normal ones), which I confessed to my mum. I don't know why I felt this way, and I don't know what triggered it.

Still around the age of 10 years old, I began to worry about molesting children. I had no intention or desire to do so, yet I worried that I did. My first memory of this was at a family member's house and their newborn baby was given to me to hold. As I was holding the baby, I started questioning whether I was touching the baby inappropriately. Why I was thinking about this,  especially as I was a child myself, I don't know. But from then on, if a child would walk near me on the bus or on the street, I would move my body away from them, scared that if my body touched them that I would be doing it with sexual intent. I would even be nervous to hold the hand of a young family member, and wonder how I'd cope holding my own babies when I become a mother in future. I remember once feeling scared that I wanted to sexually abuse my older sister. Once during school, the police came in to talk to us as a school safety policy, and I worried that they would arrest me for these things, even though I did not at all act on them or want to act on them at all.
At around 14, I became scared of passing on germs, diseases or poisoning others. When I went to the toilet I would spend extra time washing my hands, and even my forearms. When washing dishes in the kitchen, I would spend uneccesary amounts of time rinsing the plates, cups and cutlery. I would even spend 3 minutes rinsing something as tiny as a teaspoon. I had to get all of the kitchen soap off of the dishes. I thought that if there was still soap left on them then someone would become poisoned whilst using the dishes, it would be traced back to me that I was the one washing up, and then I would be sent to prison. When cooking for my family, I would have to pray that no one was poisoned. I feared that if I breathed on the food then 'fumes' from my nose would poison the food. So I would turn my nose away from the food and breathe in another direction to avoid this happening. There was a day that I thought the 'fumes' had poisoned a jar of sugar I had opened, so in a panic I washed the jar of sugar in an attempt to get the poison out. I often feared that I had germs or poison on my fingers, and if I had to give someone something, I used as little fingers as possible. At about 17, I started worrying about giving or receiving STIs from public toilets, even though I had never had sex. 
I would have unintentional bad thoughts that I didn't mean or want at all. These thoughts came under different categories. One of them was about wanting/wishing bad things on others and myself. For instance, I would have thoughts wishing for people to die, or thoughts as though I wanted to hurt someone who I had no intention of hurting. Once I remember writing my name down on a sign-up sheet. My surname has the word 'gun' in it, and I worried that I had emphasised these three letters in my writing as a threat of violence. I would have thoughts wishing I was ugly, evil, talentless etc (even though these are things I am scared of happening) and these wishes would be about others too. I didn't want these thoughts so I would pray for them to not come true, or for the wishes to be reversed back to normal if they had already come true. I would also feel like I desired bad things to happen to me like rape, abuse, illnesses etc even though I didn't actually want them to happen and would be scared of them happening. I felt like having these bad things would make me an inspiration, brave or special and give me attention and sympathy. I felt like I envied people who went through those things but I felt guilty for having these thoughts because I know these people would want their suffering to end. I would not purposely put myself in situations where this could happen and I would never lie and pretend that these things had happened to me. When bad things have happened to me, I've been worried that I like the fact that they have happened and that I don't want to get better. For instance, with a serious injury I had this year and am still healing from, I worry that if I pray for healing then I'm just 'fake praying' and that I don't actually mean what I'm praying. Although I have gotten attention over it, I don't ask for it or enjoy the attention or the injury. I even try to make it seem like it's not a big deal and that I can be independent despite it.  Also with these worries I've been having, they have bothered me a lot but I worry that I don't want to get better or want them to go away, even though I do want them to go.
Another category  was bad thoughts about God. While I would pray, I would sometimes get thoughts of swearing at God, and I would have to pray for forgiveness as I feared I would be punished for these unintentional thoughts towards Him.
A third category was insulting thoughts towards people. I would have random bad thoughts about people of certain races or sexual orientations. Another would also be insulting thoughts about people that I didn't mean to have at all. For example, if a close friend who I cared for was talking to me, I would have a thought towards them like 'Bitch', even though I didn't consider them a bitch at all.
To try and make all these thoughts go away I would do many things like scream 'No!', whisper 'Shhh', hit myself in the head with my fist/hand, slap myself on the face, poke my fingernails into my skin until it left temporary marks, bang my fist on a table, twist my forearm, pray for forgiveness, make funny faces, try to neutralise the thoughts by adding a 'not' in my head on the end of the thoughts. I would usually do these things when I was alone, although sometimes when my family were around I would do them without thinking and my family members would notice. But most of the time when I was in public, I'd do more discreet things that were less noticeable like poke my skin under my clothes or under the table.
Since about 12, every few years I have doubts about my sexuality. Even though  I'm sure deep down that I'm straight and am attracted to men, I would get worries of being attracted to some females I knew. I would find them fascinating, think about them a lot and want to talk to them. Although I wondered if this made me attracted to them, I had no desire to act romantically and/or sexually with them. I sometimes try to test myself by thinking of women sexually to see if I enjoy the thoughts. Recently when I've seen pictures of women, thought of women or even seen my own female family members, I have suddenly experienced sensations in my private area. Even though I've worried this may mean I'm attracted to women, these sensations are not pleasurable at all but are a bit painful. I don't feel comfortable when thinking of women in this way. Sometimes I avoid looking at pictures of women e.g on Dailymail so that I don't get the painful sensations. I do not think homosexuality is wrong at all, but I worry that my sexuality is different to what I have known it to be for most of my life.
These are ranges of different fears and thoughts I've had over the years. Some of them have reduced, others have stayed and others have intensified during these last few months. The sexuality fears, memories from childhood that cause guilt, thoughts of wanting harm to come to (or wanting to harm) others, bad wishes and some of my outward behaviours to make the thoughts and fears go away have intensified during these months. I do not like them, and I would never want to act on them.
Does anyone have anything like this?

"Hi everyone,

I'll share a little about myself. My name is Karlie and I'm 17 years old. I've wondered if I have OCD for a while, but I've always been too embarrassed to get help about it. I know you can't diagnose me here but I was wondering if you'd be able to read my symptoms, tell me if they seem like OCD and if I should see my doctor about it. I'm quite worried about seeing my doctor because I'm afraid they're going to judge me and I'm especially ashamed about talking about some of the violent/sexual things that pop into my head.

Symptoms:

I worry about germs and getting contaminated a lot. I am very concerned with surfaces in the bathroom, kitchen and science labs when at school, I feel like they can never be clean and the things on them will cause me harm. I usually wash my hands after touching those things. At one point I was worried about germs getting in my mouth and would be going to the sink to spit very often, there wasn’t really any logic behind it but I still worried about it. I also worry about house hold cleaning products causing me harm, especially bleach. After bleach is applied to something I end up avoiding it for hours and when I eventually use it I worry excessively about getting it on my skin or ingesting it. I had one point in time where I would be getting up every couple of minutes to wash myself because I thought I got some on me, I also though I swallowed some and would think that I was going to die. I would keep subtly going up to my dad and get him to reassure me that I was fine. I also go out of my way to avoid animals because I’m afraid of them being diseased or have faeces on them. A little while ago my sister got a hamster and I tried to make sure she wouldn’t get one. It stayed in her room most of the time which meant I didn’t end up going in there much because I worry about the germs it had. The thought popped into my head to hurt the hamster at one point and that made me feel like a horrible person even though there is no way I’d ever do that.


Sometimes I have really bad thoughts pop into my head. I sometimes have violent/sexual thoughts/images pop into my head and they can be very distressing because I really don’t want to think about things like that and I would never do any of the things I’ve thought about. Sometimes it’s quite hard to stop thinking about something which popped into my head because I worry that if I’m thinking about it that on some level I want it to happen. Sometimes the idea of a family member dying in a car crash pops into my head and this is extremely distressing for me because I keep going though it in my mind checking to make sure I don’t want it to happen. I know I obviously don’t want it to happen but I just can’t take my own word for it.


I also obsess about a few different things. After using the taps on the sink I must check that they’re all off before leaving the room and sometimes I end up going back to check because I still don’t feel like I definitely know the taps are off. At night when I go to get something from the fridge I always worry that I haven’t shut the fridge door properly. I have to push on the fridge door and keep doing it until it feels right. I then keep going up and down checking the seal on the fridge door to make sure it’s actually shut until it feels right and I’m happy. I know there is no need to worry about it that much but I still can’t help myself from doing it. Sometimes I try to just close the door and walk away, but every time I end up going back to check because I can’t bear not checking. When going to bed at night I obsess over a few different things. I make sure everything on the desk is aligned properly because I worry about stuff falling off the desk, someone tripping on it and getting hurt. I also make sure unused plugs are off in my room because I’m worried about them causing a fire and hurting my family. I worry that if I’m not careful and don’t check things over harm will come to my family and it’ll be all my fault. Getting ready for bed can sometimes take a long time because I end up check time and time again because I just don’t feel confident I’ve checked properly. I also have to do these checks when I’m leaving the house because I worry about fire. I obsess a lot more when leaving the house because I won’t be there to check on everything and must guarantee I’ve checked properly. For a long time I used to worry about my dad dying overnight and I would end up getting up to check he’s still breathing. When that was happening it really made sleep very difficult because I’d be constantly worrying and would have to get up to check.


I was wondering if I should print off my symptoms and take it along to the doctors with me?

Thanks,

Karlie

"I am beginning to think I have OCD. For the past few years I've had some weird habits but it was never a big deal for me. I just thought I was just extra responsible and careful. Like when I have to carry something important to work, I need to check my bag for it about 10 times before I close my bag and then about 10 times on the way to make sure I have them. When I set my alarm to wake up, I must check about 15 times to see if I put AM instead of PM or make sure my phone is not on silent. I always thought it was just a weird habit and nothing serious. I always have to check several times to make sure the door is locked or that all electronics are off before I leave the house. But in January, I had a really traumatic experience for me, and I have had a very very stressful 2 months. Because of that experience, I developed a fear of diseases and germs. I felt anxious talking to people face to face in fear that spit hit my mouth, sometimes I felt spit that wasn't there, I avoided touching people, items or even surfaces. I couldn't even hug my mother or shake my friend's hands. Basically for the past few weeks I isolated myself completely. I also developed a rash on my hands a few weeks ago from washing my hands too much and they made me even more anxious because I was afraid of infection. Basically in any type of situation I imagine the worst. I recently became educated about OCD.

"My daughter is displaying controlling behaviour. She says she feels like she needs to control what her siblings, parents, friends do to keep them safe. She has always worried about us dying from a very young age (about 2 years old from memory) she worries about planes crashing, rabies, etc etc, to the stage of trying to keep us all in sight. She is also highly possessive of her toys, when questioned she worries they'll get lost/broken by the younger children. If I enforce a 'share' she can't take her eyes off the toy and follows the sibling around until she can sneak it back, she will then hide it and say it's lost. She's now 10 years old and is great at playing with her siblings with other items ie at the park or at friends houses, she watches out for them and will play happily for hours. Does this sound like OCD? She doesn't have any cleaning rituals that I'm aware of, and I haven't noticed any counting, repeating going on.","['rash', 'OCD', 'Rituals']",[],"['rash', 'Rituals', 'OCD']",,1.0,,,
"Hi guys,
I was doing a bit better up until I went out drinking with a friend on Friday and the following day I began to have what felt like a near constant panic attack. I became really afraid that I was going mad and started fearing schizophrenia massively again. As a result I spent most of the day reading about schiz-OCD where people are really scared they will get it and so they think about the symptoms etc. Since then I keep obsessing about it and I will have the kinds of thoughts I think they would have and it is almost like I am testing myself with them and of course they cause a big anxiety spike and scare me that I will believe them as I feel like I have to have 100% certainty that I dont and I cant feel that. I dont know if any of you guys have experienced this before? Do I just try to treat the thoughts the same as any other intrusive thought?

"I feel my anxiety building since last night. I started to wonder what could be worse than my current """"""""theme"""""""" in harm OCD... Then a bible verse popped in my head!!! I won't share but it was something a mom did to her kids in a desperate time and I about threw up!
So then I thought, ok. Here's a great time to practice sitting with the thought and not saying anything to it or about it. My temptation was to just talk to myself about it. I've never got ahead of a thought like that, so was that a success? Is that ERP kind of? The thought popped up through the night as I got little sleep, and has this morning too. I thought the thought was suppose to go away if I gave it no attention.
I think in the back of my mind I'm worried I'll fear that thing.. So I thought, """"""""Yep. Current fear, not so bad!"""""""" in a kind of joking way.

"Hey everybody I have a problem and need advice from people who can at least kinda understand me So I've had OCD for a while now and I want everything to be clean. (I'm 17 btw) I have therapy and my therapist and my mom thought it was a good idea to get a dog. My brother was immediately on board with it, bit I had my concerns but I pushed them aside because I thought that my therapist would know what would help me. Now we have a dog and shes as sweet as can be but shes a puppy and has constant accidents which I clean excessively like the freak I am ^^ But I find myself not wanting to be touched by the dog. I don't want her to sit on the couch. I don't want her to lick me and I don't want to pet her. I still do it though but I really don't like it and I think she can feel it. I feel responsible for her having a great life and I just can't give her everything she needs. We've had her for one and a half weeks and could still give her back. I don’t want to „quit“ but she’s a living beeing and I feel like she would have a better life elsewhere. My mom helps me take care of her but she says that the puppy is my responsibility and I keep worrying about her and the bacteria she might bring inside the house. I clean her way too often and I really have to resist the urge to disinfect her. I am so scared that my OCD will get worse or I will just have one very bad day and then I will scrub my puppy until I think she’s clean. I used to practically boil my hands and I still shower every day but no longer with too hot water. It’s just that I sometimes feel like my mind isn’t my own and I am terrified to think that my puppy would have to suffer because of my OCD. I don’t know what to do.

I HATE DOG POO!!!! But I am now faced with a problem. My in laws dog died a few months back. To be honest it has made going there much less stressful has I worried about my kiddies who are 4 and 2 being down there playing on the carpets/floor with the doggy hairs and such. :blushing: To be honest I don't even like touching dogs unless I can wash straight away it makes my hands feel yucky. Anyways, my stepson who lives with me his 9. He has wanted a dog but mainly because of space, time and partly OCD I can't have one here. So what have my in laws done? Bought him a puppy for down there (he sees them regular). He is a lovely Boarder Collie pup 12 weeks old. But I was having a panic yesterday has they are trying to 'potty' train him. Because of this my mother in law has a baby mat thing in the kitchen to do his wees and poos on, although they are trying to get him to go in the garden. Anyways my son who is 4 has autism and part of this is he likes to walk in a little route around there house. To be horror yesterday he walked straight over this mat and it was stained :helpsmilie: I asked was the stain poo and was told it was mud from the garden (I honestly think it was a poo stain)plus there was wee stains on this mat. My son walked through it in his socks. :crybaby: I couldn't show any panic there (they don't get mental health) and didn't want to upset my son. I didn't clean his feet or anything but gave him a bath later on. My whole house feels contaminated now and now I will have to repeat my worries this afternoon has they are having the kids for a hour.
Sorry this is long winded. I guess I am hoping for some advice. I know kiddies grow up around dogs in many homes. If I hadn't seen him walking on the mat I would have been none the wiser and just carried on. I can't afford the worry everytime I go down there.

"Hi
I have had a break from the forum. I am practicing ERP on my ocd - magical thinking and thought-action fusion. I have done a lot and also horrible ones - every day I do al lot fx I went into a church the other day with my two boys and had to think bad thoughts about loosing them. I managed (heartbreaking) and I manage to touch items for longer and loger time, items which my ocd finds """"""""magical and can make thoughts happen"""""""" while thinking something bad will happen to my kids, I try to stop my rituals as much as possible and try to convince myself that when I do this my ocd gets worse for a while (the second spike), but I just have to hang in and let the doubt and anxiety pass.
But my ocd is still ruining my life, and I still fear thinking bad Things. I still fear that if I have a scenario about my kids being taken from me in my head, I need to undo it. I still cant tolerate to deliberately think that someone will take my kids or treat them bad. And I dont know why, when I know its the only crue, but it is so hard for me to stop completely, I feel guilty and in panic that I risk anything. At the same time I keep saying that it is just ocd and I have these thoughts because my kids mean so much to me and the scenarios are the Things I do not want to experience or that is so not me.
But I guess I ruminate and discuss to much in my head. And then the fear is so strong. But I am doing all those exposures so why dont it go Down in intensity?
Its so hard to have to deal with images both those popping up all the time and having to see horrible images deliberately. I just want to live a normal life and allow myself to feel enjoyment, to think anything without feeling every thought has consequences, and to relaxe and enjoy life without feeling I will somehow be punished for it. People without ocd do this, it is the purpose of life - not to be afraid of something that cant happen at all.
I just want ocd to be gone and the feeling that my thoughts can come true when they cannot.
I try not to talk about my ocd but just do the ERP in silence because I cant talk my way out of it.
I guess I need to get a new job that interests me and occupy my brain.
I just want to love and enjoy my kids without the noise of ocd. But I am so Lucky that I am able to enjoy and love them despite the noise, but it will be lovely if ocd just shut up.

"Hi
I have been having many rituals lately. Every 5 minutes, I am having to ie, touch something repeatedly while I do a ritual, and if someone says or doesnt say something to me in the next 5 seconds, then I must do a ritual. At work it is getting to me a bit and I am starting to worry that people will notice my strange behaviour. It is just a bit of a relapse at the mo, but these rituals are very exhausting. I am having to switch a light on and off and it can take up to 20 or 30 times before I get the mental ritual right, and I am exhaused afterwards. I keep thinking to myself """"""""No I must try and resist the rituals"""""""" but that is easier said than done. I am still convinced that if I dont obey the OCD, and try and resist even 1 ritual, then something bad will happen.
I have been on meds for nearly a year now and they are helping a lot. My depresssion has improved but the OCD is rearing its ugly head. Whenever i suffer a relapse, it is often the depression kicks in and the OCd improves, but now it is the other way round. Thoughts of harming others are not as bad as they used to be.

On the way home I argued with a colleague because she said I was being morose and I need to sort myself out and get off my tablets.

"Hi,
Just wanted to share my story in the hope it might help someone...
I think I started posting on these forums at the end of 2009 (username Matilda) when I started to realise that my hand-washing was becoming a problem. OCD crept up on me: constant hand-washing, checking, ruminating, avoidance (including avoiding driving). I went to my GP in October 2009 and told him I thought I had OCD and needed help! I resigned from my job in November 2009 thinking this would solve a lot of my OCD issues. The OCD loved the fact that I now had more time to obsess and I couldn't leave my flat at one point.
There was no immediate help available to me so in December, when I was feeling despair every day, I asked for some anti-depressants. I was put on an SSRI Sertraline (100mg). I felt a bit better quite quickly - I don't for one moment think this was the medication as anti-depressants usually take at least a few weeks to start working. I just think that my mood was lifting naturally, I'd gotten so low and the only way to go was up. However, I was still unemployed, didn't feel I could handle the stress of work yet and my life was still very restricted. At the start of 2010 I started to see a mental health nurse. In all honesty I don't think she knew much about OCD and I didn't find her that helpful, but it was someone to talk to, to check I was eating and sleeping properly. My nurse went on long term sick so I received a phone call from another nurse to check I was OK, at random intervals.
The following months were a waiting game. As the months went by, waiting to get my CBT referral, I gradually started to feel better. I did lots of voluntary work and I started (paid) work full time in September 2010. I started CBT in late April/Early May 2011. The CBT has been helpful in challenging some of deep-seated beliefs I have (about myself and others) but when it came to challenging the OCD behaviours, we found that most of them had gone or weakened considerably. I'm still continuing with the CBT and although I think it would have been more helpful at the end of 2009 when I was at my worst, I know that there is still work that I can do. With advice from my therapist and GP I slowly came of my meds about 2 weeks ago. So far, I feel fine.
In terms of my symptoms now, I still excessively handwash (mainly when preparing food) although nowhere near as much as I used to. I have very little contamination fear. I rarely check (appliances/windows/doors).
I passed my driving test in October 2006 and I have largely avoided driving since. I have so many fears around driving (harming others etc). On Sunday I drove for the first time in about a year and a half - my partner was in the car with me. I had never driven on my own. The main reason I am writing this today is that this morning I drove my partner to the train station and drove back on my own. It was scary but I did it and I feel so proud of myself.
I'm not saying the last 21 months have been easy, they were not. I had to wait a long time for CBT - something which still angers me. I have good days and bad days and I completely understand that I will probably get ill again at some point in my life. I just wanted to share my story because when I was paralysed by fear in my flat, feeling like no one, except the people on this forum were helping or understanding me, I never thought I would one day feel like this. It sounds cheesy but I feel freedom. I just hope that this gets through to people like me, the me of 21 months ago and gives them a little bit of hope.","['checking', 'despair', 'Medication', 'symptom', 'Food', 'writing', 'anger', 'Thought', 'hope', 'fear', 'OCD']",['excessive'],"['hope', 'OCD', 'Food', 'anger', 'fear', 'checking', 'writing', 'Thought', 'excessive', 'symptom', 'Medication', 'despair']",,1.0,,,
"Hi, 
I just wanted to share this in case it can help anybody else. I did great the first few months of lockdown, in fact to the point I felt guilty I was enjoying it. Had a couple of OCD spikes but dealt with them. I didn't drink for the first few months. Then I began to let the booze creep back in. Maybe two or three beers in the evening. Anxiety and OCD increased. I had one very stressful day deciding if I should quit my job before I went back. There were good reasons and in the end I left. I was incredibly stressed and upset and drank a small glass of wine and three beers with my dinner, went to bed early, slept pretty well. I had a dream about an OCD theme and in the morning went into a bad decline. It's be 14 days now and I'm still struggling with it. One of the worst OCD spikes I've ever had.
It's hard for me - I have OCD which I have to fight each day, I also have ADHD which makes relaxing extremely hard, I also have some difficult past issues which upset me quite often, to do with the tragic death of a family member and our difficult relationship before he died. So, it's a struggle, and booze helps in the short term.
So - anybody reading this who wants to drink and knows they shouldn't - DON'T! I know how easy it is to fall into the trap. I've thrown away a really good stretch and have had to beg for my old job back and put my Mum through so much stress. Just wanted to share that.","['guilt', 'joy', 'anxiety', 'anxiety', 'fall', 'OCD']","['spike', 'theme']","['anxiety', 'fall', 'joy', 'spike', 'theme', 'OCD', 'guilt']",1.0,,,,

"Okay, so I've suffered with OCD since my early teens, worried about being gay or had HOCD as some may call it, worried about going to hell, eating meat and I beat all of them, but I can't get my head around my current ones! These might be weird to some but I have no idea what to do! How to cope or beat them! So first thing you should know about me is I love sport and fitness and the gym and this is what my thoughts have developed around, so this is how they go.. I think of playing football for example and say I think about winning the county championship, this Is where the anxiety comes in, I think of that and the thoughts what's the point come into my head, basically with anything to do with winning anything or pushing myself such as pushing myself in the gym, trying to push myself to gain in size and look as good as I can for example and thinking what's the point, i and all of this causes anxiety. Now with my other worries I just thought 'oh well maybe I am gay' or 'oh well maybe I will go to hell' basically spiked myself as much as I could by maybe doing something which made me anxious, such as rating a male on their looks, or depicting a religious picture (I'm sorry if that offends anyone it's just what I had to do), but if anyone else suffers like that that's the best advice I could give just don't react to your thought, or don't care, but I can't seem to think how to battle what I'm experiencing now, any advice or ideas would be much appreciated, thanks!","['OCD', 'anxiety', 'anxiety', 'Thought']",['spike'],"['Thought', 'spike', 'anxiety', 'OCD']",1.0,,,,
"I've had OCD for basically as long as I can remember, but I never identified what it was until last May, and I was properly diagnosed this May. I've had many different themes and they've all been pretty **** in their own special way!
My latest theme is to do with something that happened about 4 months ago and whether I should tell my boyfriend about it or not.
Basically, about 4 months ago I was at a house party and I was very very drunk. Me and my boyfriend had been together for about 5 months, but we were temporarily long distance for the summer, and we hadn't been talking as often as I would have liked so I was a bit sad about that. Also at the party was a friend I hadn't seen for about a year, but I had slept with him a few times in the past. We had a bit of a catch up and chatted for a while and that was it until everyone all moved inside to my friend's bedroom. He sat next to me and had his hand on my lower leg for a while. I was half asleep at the time, and it just felt kinda nice, so I didn't move his hand. Since I was almost asleep anyway, I lay down and fell asleep, and only woke up when I realised he was lying next to me and had his arm around me. I knew this wasn't really appropriate, told him to **** off and went to sleep on the sofa downstairs. That's all that happened, I don't have any feelings for this guy and I had no intentions of kissing him or anything like that.
At the time I did feel bad about this but I decided not to tell my boyfriend as I thought it would make it sound like a big deal and possibly cause tension between us for no reason whatsoever. Every now and then since then I would remember it and feel guilty, but stuck with my decision.
However, about 10 days ago it came back to me massively, I think because I was in the middle of exams and as I'm sure everyone's experienced, stress can make the OCD loads worse. I spent an entire day googling about cheating and what counts as cheating, and whether you should tell your partner if you cheated, and all that sort of thing.
I've been feeling extremely guilty, and like our whole relationship is a lie, like I don't deserve him and all of that kind of thing. Currently I'm upset because he might be buying me a guitar for christmas and surely if he knew what a bitch I was he wouldn't do that! The urge to confess is incredibly strong, and although I've read about other people having this confession OCD, mine is actually an event that happened where I did act badly, so there is some foundation to the worrying. I don't want to give in to the OCD, tell him, and have a bad impact on our relationship, but I also don't want to hide things from him or anything like that.
I'm at a complete loss with how to deal with this. I find it hard to accept the thoughts like I often do, because normally I'm worrying about a “what if” whereas this time I'm ruminating over whether to tell him or not. So does anyone have any advice on how to accept and thereby neutralise these thoughts? Or should I just do the “right” thing and tell him about it?","['talking', 'bedroom', 'urge', 'guilt', 'Thought', 'OCD']",['theme'],"['urge', 'talking', 'bedroom', 'Thought', 'theme', 'OCD', 'guilt']",1.0,,,,
"Hello
My 18 year old daughter has OCD, BDD and AS, but she is in a desperate state at the moment. She won't take her meds, the NHS refuses to see her because she won't engage with them, so she is left to sink. I have spoken to her GP but because she's 18 I can do nothing now to help her medically.
She actually plucked up the courage to go out last night with her friends (which happens rarely) and the preparations for the event were horrendous, with photos and checking. Today she is beyond hysterical due to photos that her friends have put on FB and Twitter. She looks gorgeous, but says she's fat and is self-harming to a huge degree to cope with her feelings. Her arms are seriously scarred. She thinks the pictures make her look fat and ugly. She can see spots that I can't see. She sees shadows under spots that I can't see.
I am lost about what to say to make her feel better, but also don't want to get caught up in the checking rituals. No matter what I say I'm wrong. She is becoming seriously angry, aggressive and violent in response to anything I say. What she called me last night is actually beyond shocking and also totally unfair, as I do my best for her. I want to help her, but feel helpless at the same time. Do I leave her to sink or swim now that she is 18? As I mum, I struggle with this!
Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated. Thank you.","['OCD', 'Rituals', 'shock', 'checking']",[],"['shock', 'checking', 'Rituals', 'OCD']",,1.0,,,
"So first I want to say that I know I should probably go to the doctor about this but I'm scared. Which I know is silly but hmm. Haven't spoken to anyone about it before.
I've had this thing for the last three years or so where I always have to be on the left: walking down the street, sat on the bus, in bed. I have to be on the left hand side of the person I'm with or I get extremely upset. Normally this is fine for me to manage, but close friends have noticed my 'little dance' to get on the left of them when we're walking down the street. It drives my boyfriend crazy.
That in itself is manageable. But then I have these repetitive circular thoughts where I think about the same things and themes every day. In daytime it's usually thoughts of failure or being killed, then at night a thought of running away from someone chasing me in a forest. I've been diagnosed with depression but I don't know if that's right, or what I should do? Does this sound like ocd or am I overreacting? I don't know anyone with ocd to talk to about this.","['depression', 'OCD', 'Thought']",['theme'],"['Thought', 'theme', 'depression', 'OCD']",1.0,,,,
"Hi, I feel so bad recently not felt this depressed or low before. I feel so unmotivated and I've become very lazy. Any talk about work upsets me I think because im scared. If you've seen my other posts I also feel like a really bad person, I think I really am actually horrible not just ocd talking. Im morngy, moody, getting annoyed at the slightest stupid thing.
I was thinking about getting help about a month ago when my ocd spiked for like 3 weeks but that was resolved. I dont think I can seek help as I have said in the past as I am a teacher (unemployed) but if I get help it'll be on my records that im depressed and have ocd then I prob wont get a job as they do a health check on you and look at medical records.
Is seeing a pychiatrist confidential or do their notes and stuff go on your medical records? Im assuming it has to go on?
Im worried as I dont want to be morngy and moody as im ruining my familys life and one day I will think why was I such as bitch and took life for granted and it'll be too late!
I dont know how id cope without a particular family member! I dont talk about ocd with anyone (apart from here) any more as I dont want to upset them and they dont understand I also fear I stressthem out and they'll get ill or die.
I feel lost and low and depressed and I dont know what to do.
My ocd doesn't seem as bad either however I think the annoyance and irritation is part of it. I do keep getting irritated by mess and towels sorting the stupid towels!
Im worried my ocd might get worse in life if i dont try sort it now! I thought i was developing another type of ocd the other week like not remember if i did or didnt do something and i dont want that!

"Hello anonymous1
I also have the curtains closed all day, can't open windows (apart from at the back of the house & that's not always guaranteed either) in case someone walks round the back to see if we're in, i hate making any kind of a noise if i'm home alone in case people know i'm in & i have PA's if someone knocks & i hide in my own home keeping silent (even holding my breath so i'm not heard) I even worry someone will hear me typing on the keyboard as well :blushing:
I rarely go out, if i do always accompanied, i go to parents in car (straight there & back generally) i hide in their home too if anyone knocks or goes in & get trapped in a room unable to leave it if someone does go in. If someone comes to our home for my Fiancee unannounced then i get trapped in my own home as well, unable to leave one room (even unable to use to the toilet).
I can't use public transport due to bad experiences with it previously, I don't have a life at all, just an existance. Like Ruth i get snappy if i feel threatened (not @ my BF though, but with my mum & dad mainly) as they have a habit of keep asking if i'm ok..... drawing attention to my problems in my eyes & i won't say if i'm not in case others hear
Ruth i think your progress is totally amazing :clapping: I am not on meds either, i wont take them & was worried this may make it impossible for me to conquer as most do take meds with therapy, so i'm really pleased to hear you're doing so well without it..... I have only today asked a question on here about CBT & ERP as i am wondering what i'm getting myself into & I am one of those people that needs to know before hand in order to cope with things.
I need hrs to get ready & get up at 5:45am daily so i can exercise & get housework done before others/normal life begins & people could knock at the door, i used to have tonnes of rituals & get ready over & over all day & into the evening , i have cut that down an awful lot, i still have to make all appointments afternoon though, i can't go anywhere or see anyone without make up either (apart from immediate family, but even then i feel completely uncomfortable/repulsive.)
I have never been able to go out to work, i have no qualifications, just 2 friends IRL & forum friends i'm truly greatful to around the world with similar problems, i feel a total failure & hate not being able to contribute financially to the home. I think it's gret you can hold down a job :cool:
Like anonymous1 I have been poked fun at for being ugly & never got BF's, it makes mevery uneasy in my relationship now (although we've been together 8 yrs now, i'm still very insecure & intimacy is very hard for me) previous relationships (if you could call them that we're all total failures) i don't honestly think i'll ever be able to walk down the street or answere the door or go out the front door even to put rubbish out without make up on (as even to this day people poke fun at my appearance) I know my flaws are real though (something everyone with BDD says i know) but even those close to me see what i see & abhore so much, i have consulted surgeons for prices of ops but just haven't been able to afford them (i'd rather try therapy first & only result to surgery if therapy doesn't work for me) if that makes any sense?
Debra i can completely unserstand your mirror checking & crying too hun, I alos do this (whenever possible though) i avoid mirrors like the plague, unless i have to see someone or go somewhere i ted to avoid them whenever i can, makes my attacks alot less frequent (if that makes any sense?) I'm sure you look fine, like others on here, i just wish we could all perceive ourselves as the good others say we have in our appearance rather than only see what we hate. I'm so sorry that even with therapy & meds you find it all so dificult, i know it doesn't work totally for everyone, but i truly hope that you find something that helps in the very near future & that tings improve for you much more

"Hi and happy new year to all the OCD UK members. I am going to discuss on a topic that is a vital question for all the Pur-O sufferers like me and widely discussed also. I have a OCD thought of trying to remember a particular past event and based on these taking a decession that I haven't harmed a person. That thought takes a violent form time to time and then I have to get help of my clinician. He is treating me for last 13 years. I think there is nothing new in the story. But recently when I had an OCD episode, he suggested me to just stop thinking of these. According to him, the thought itself is the OCD. There is no solution or conclusion to these thoughts possible. He suggested me to stop the thought and DON'T LOOK AT THE DARK WELL OF OBSESSIVE THOUGHTS. But somebody tells that trying to stop forcefully brings excessive anxiety. They tell to accept the thought. What it means? From my experience what I learnt is that as Compulsive hand washers never gets assured that his hand is clean, a """"""""Compulsive Thinker"""""""" never gets assured that he has got the right answer or conclusion to his thoughts. This is an infinite loop. So can I stop thinking of these malicious thoughts? Can I think like this-""""""""These are OCD thoughts, don't touch them"""""""". Can I """"""""Quarentine"""""""" these thoughts as my doctor said? Is stopping the Obsessive thought at all possible?

I fear contamination now on my keys, door handles, etc etc and it goes on.

"Hello, I have had a recent spike, after maybe 2-3 years of being pretty good.
I think I have a long history of various forms of OCD. And have a family history of anxiety and ocd.
My sisters have suffered from severe depression, anxiety, and OCD, and basically had completely breakdowns. They have basically recovered though.
But you'd think this would help me, as I remember the illogical e-mails I used to get from them, asking me bizarre questions, and seeking reassurance, and me telling them they were being ridiculous. Now, I'm afraid, I've become riduculous.
I've always had OCD traits as a child (huge fears of dying, getting ill) In the last 7-8 years ago, I also started getting traditional OCD issues - checking things.
My main thing, on and off, for the last decade has been the fear that I was a pedophile. My sexuality issues started of with fearing I was gay, then to fearing I loved my sister, then to boys. Then switched to girls.
It's generally spiked, by things I've seen on television. This sends me into the checking, thinking, worrying, anxiety, checking, worrying, thing. I can't recall ever having an erection from this process, and find the thought/checking process deeply traumatic, and depressing.
I've actually had long periods of clarity, over the years, when I've seen how ridiculous the thoughts are. But, never the less, they still return.
I'm here, because, even now, I still worry that I'm not POCD. Even though my life basically mirrors the diagnosis.
I find myself thinking back to my teenage years, and my early 20s, and who I fancied. And then looking them up now etc etc. Worrying that they were maybe 14-15 at the time.
Then thinking about that movie Kids, which I probably watched when I was in my late teens, early 20s. Even though the actors in the sex scenes were all 18+ etc etc
I find myself reading the diagnosis of paedophillia, and seeing if it applies to me. I'm currently worrying about """"""""regressive paedophillia"""""""" where people start off normal, and then regress to children when they get older, due to circumstances in their life.
The only thing that calms me down, is that I never have fantasies about children. I think about them to test myself, but I find the process upsetting, depressing, and generally feel a bit disgusted by it all. I'm assuming no matter how someone gets to paedophillia, they enjoy it?
I guess I'm just looking for a few answered questions like any person with OCD. I should know better.

"I'm new to this forum, i joined today. I feel so alone and like no one really understands what its like to be a sufferer so thought id join this forum to talk to people who understand and to learn about their experiences with ocd.
I started with ocd over 2 years ago, but only confided in someone in april this year. Since then ive been on fluoxetine 20 mg to start with but after 2 months of that went onto 40 mg. I have also started sessions of cbt .. ive had four so far.
I have obsessive behaviours with counting. I count the number of letters in words and phrases and keep adding and adding until i get to numbers in the thousands. This has affected me so much that i have gone from an A to an E in my english and have now had to drop that subject as i cant read books or do my work. Im currently in the last year of my a levels and because ive had to drop my english going to uni is now out of the question next year. Im still doing biology and psychology but each day it gets harder and i often have to leave my lessons because instead of doing the work and practicing for exams i just spend all the time counting the letters and keep adding them together more and more.
I also have to check everything. When im driving i have to turn around and come home to check the house again, and often have to retrace my journey to check i havnt gone through red lights or ran anyone over. I constantly check electricals, taps, locks etc, so much so i cant really leave the house unless someone is home to lock up after me.
The worse problem and the most recent is my fear of the number three. I cant buy things in threes or do things three times. This has become such an issue that so many basic daily taks are such a struggle. This christmas i cant even get my sister a card because all of them in my local shops have three words on a line or three words inside or something similar. I have to leave any situation where there is three of something in the room or the person is wearing something with three buttons on for example. Decorating the christmas tree brought me to tears (as do many things with ocd rituals) because the baubles all appeared to me to someway be in rows of three. Fortunately some things dont click that theyre in threes but i cant bear the thought of it getting any worse because eventually everything in threes will occur to me but everyday i notice more and more things :/
The fluoxetine has helped my moods a bit as im either very high and happy or very low and teary. My therapist wants to up my dose to 60mg but that would involve taking three tablets a night and the thought of that petrifies me!! The cbt im having is aiding my understanding of why this is happening but im really in need of talking to people who are going through it and know what its like just to get by day to day.","['fear', 'decorating', 'Rituals', 'talking', 'drop', 'Thought', 'OCD']",['obsessive'],"['talking', 'obsessive', 'decorating', 'drop', 'fear', 'Thought', 'Rituals', 'OCD']",,1.0,,,
"Hello everyone.
I am 15 years old, male, and I have been struggling with Pure O for 2 years.
I should probably give you a little insight of my background first.
Ever since I was a young kid, I started to show more intellectual abilites than other kids and isolated myself for many, many years.
Eventually, around the age of 12, I noticed I could handle a lot of themes most kids around that age wouldn't stand and understand some abstract and philosophical aspects of life, something my peers weren't used to do.
But a year later, OCD struck. I began fearing my genitalia and I would refuse to touch it in any way, which had my mother help me when I needed to get dressed and made me wash my hands for too long after going to the bathroom. The reason for this was that, overnight, for no apparent reason, I began to fear germs.
My mother became very concerned and took me to a psychologist. I don't remember a lot from then, but the problem went away in less than two months.
The year went by and everything seemed perfect. I was graduating as a senior from junior high (9th grade) and I had surrounded myself with some people I cared about. I also explored my identity in ways I loved and cherished. Ranging from daydreaming, to fleshing out my creativity, learning the veracity of lust, I was okay.
However, it didn't last long.
On January 29th, 2012, I did something that would have marked me forever.
Something I do a lot (since a young age) is check IMDB on the info on movies, and, in order to see if an R-rated flick would be too much for me, I checked the parents guide quite often, even if most times I regretted it because of spoilers (keep in mind, cinema is one of my passions). Around that time, a movie that was heavily reviewed as an Oscar favorite was David Fincher's remake of """"""""The Girl WIth the Dragon Tattoo"""""""", and although I had read its contents quite detailedly before, that night I decided to do it again, since my parents were going out to see it.
For some reason, that day, its contents disturbed me in a way I can't quite explain, and little did I know, the most horrendous portion of my life had begun.
For the continuing months, my mind was constantly bombarded with the most horrific, explicit sexual imagery, of all types, ranging from paedophilia, to bestiality, incest, a mix between all these, blasphemies, and even for a short period of time, coprophilia.
The fault wasn't the movie, and I always understood that (well, almost always), it was just something waiting to be triggered.
What I did was quickly brush away the thoughts (the most common way would be have someone remove their face, revealed to be a mask, and have someone else underneath it) but, of course, it just seemed to make it worse.
When the next schoolyear began, I found myself coping with going to a new school, into a class full of people I didn't know, and nervous, because I didn't have the opportunity to rest during the summer because of pure O.
Eventually, as the year went on, all the other types of pure O came into the mix: gore, harming others, fear of relationships, health issues, etc.
The problem was I never knew I had this. I... didn't. All I could think of was that I was a horrible person that didn't even deserve to be alive. But there had to be an explanation. Well, as far as my mind went, there wasn't.
It all climaxed at the beginning of spring 2013. I couldn't take it anymore, and breakdown after breakdown, I decided to search up to see if anyone had this (which I thought I was the only one) and was instantly relieved to see I had a condition, named Pure O. I remember I cried from joy, probably the only time that happened to me.
But it kept going. No matter how much I told myself all this wasn't a part of me, the battlefield that was my brain kept getting nuked.
I stopped doing hobbies I loved, I can't focus, I can't do a normal chore without having all these thoughts.
I already tried all theories I saw online, all except CBT and medication, because I knew that would mean I had to tell my mother.
Eventaully I did tell her, since I had a breakdown in the beginning of the summer in a restaurant (because I was sitting next to a kid) and she knew SOMETHING was up. I was very brief though.
I don't want medication, because I know it interferes with your brain, even if in the slightest way, and I don't want to lose the only thing that defines me, and makes me who I am: my criativity and thinking ability.
She did buy meds to calm me down, but I don't feel any different. I take the doses, but it all keeps going on. There was one day though, that for one hour, I did not feel any interference. As soon as this happened, though, I felt incomplete, and an urge to pop everything back ocurred. Of course, this simply reaffirms the good ol' """"""""This is who I am."""""""", though I am not... or maybe I am... I don't know anymore.
I have considered suicide multiple times. However, the thought of never coming back to life, destroying my family and thinking that maybe, somehow, in the future, I would be better, has kept me going. I never tried it for these reasons though.
I am now a junior, ready to begin the eleventh grade, knowing I need to decide my future, but everything reminds me of how I am losing my teen years to OCD and it just makes me more anxious.
Incest, paedophilia and blasphemy all mixed into one are my main issue and what are killing my life, in all sorts of ways. I remember I had a wishlist for this summer and I can tell you, not even ONE item got crossed out, because of avolition, due to all this.
I also have existencialism problems, but I like them, I feel like they ARE a part of me.
I thought about joining here and explaining my sotry multiple times, but I always thought I could handle everything myself.
Thing is, I don't have the strength to try anymore. I am back to square one. And no matter how much I reassure myself everything is fine, and I am not a part of this, it all keeps coming back. I need help. Please. I dont' know if it will change my mind, but... I can't live like this, drenched in sorrow and fear.

Hi everyone sorry to make a new post but just wondering when any of you have an iffy day and you feel like your brain is going into rumination how do you snap yourself out of it? I was having a shower earlier and I nearly got into arguing in my head over what worries me. I just feel uncomfortable treating my thoughts as OCD when I am in the doubting mode as often I am. I know and am aware we all feel like this but just need to hear when you are really stuck and not believing you have OCD what helps. I guess that is the nature of the disorder perhaps we don’t believe we have it.Thanks for reading.,"['Thought', 'OCD']",['rumination'],"['rumination', 'Thought', 'OCD']",1.0,,,,

"You are walking along, singing a song, happy as a pig in poo. You think, ocd? what ocd? was I really even worried about anything at all? .... suddenly something spikes you, you worry, you doubt. You try to analyse this thought to prove that nothing bad really happened. You ignore what we know about ocd (dont try to analyse it for a second), because you feel strong enough and certain enough to quickly analyse this thought and in a minute or two, you would have 'solved' this thought..... 4 hours later, you are tired, worried, shaking, dizzy, cant eat, cant sleep and still trying to analyse this thought. Why oh why did I even start to doubt what happened? why did I just jump into that thought pattern. Ok, I should just jump out and apply what I know about OCD. Tell myself that I know nothing happened and just STOP thinking about it RIGHT NOW!.... within a minute, you are analysing again, and doubting that everything is ok. Oh, and you are also doubting that other thing that happened the other day, which you proved was actually ok at the time, but it cant be can it? if this current pattern is now a doubt, then that means that yesterday's must also be a doubt. And what about that other thing that happened 10 years ago? Surely, that must have been wrong too! You are this sick, twisted, vile 'thing', you feel you are. You are not human, you are much, much lower than that.... But it cant be? can it? You must disprove these thoughts!
Now, where was I? I have lost my thinking pattern. Oh yes! I was on that first thought, and I will move across to each and every thought, in turn, to logically disprove them and think my way out of my thoughts, and finally reach the conclusion that you are ok. You will go home, close the door and not talk to anyone for the rest of the evening. An hour or so, should do it. You will prove that everything is ok and you will be fine...... Its now 4am and you are still thinking and doubting that everything is ok. Better get some sleep. Work in the morning. Brain now fried to death and feeling exhausted. Finally nod off and hour before the alarm goes. Get up like a zombie and stutter into work, moody, depressed and beaten. Is this really happening?
Ok, end of story here.......
****!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Does this stuff really go on in our brains on a daily basis?

I'm so off with myself for constantly letting myself down, being completely disorganised. Last night I wrote down a list of things I wanted to do today to try to help me get motivated. But I just got so upset looking at it. There wasn't anything interesting on there. I wrote down 'wash hands' 35 times and considering it takes about 10 mins each time that's gonna be like 350 mins which is almost 5 hours!!
I actually kind of enjoyed being ill because I just got to lie in bed. Now I'm a bit better I have to do more things which is so hard.

But last night I had a long, meandering dream that has me concerned. I'm not a new-ager or anyone who automatically imputes any significance to dreams, but this one kind of freaked me out. I was being held captive by a marauding band of sadistic flatmates (yeah, yeah, i know, its ridiculous) and they kept threatening to kill me. But I was nevertheless really attracted to the ringleader. So I'm worried that the dream speaks to my secret infatuation with power and violence.

"This isn't necessarily a question, but if anyone can relate or has any coping tips, that would be great.
I have always had very vivid dreams, and sometimes it is hard to tell from real life experiences. For instance, it is usually pretty mundane. I might have a dream that I bought something, and then I find myself looking for it the next day.
I also suffer from false memories (and have a couple things I am scared of having done).
Where it gets bad is when I have a dream about my theme (or things I am worried about having done), but it seems so vivid that it's hard to know if it is a dream. Is this normal for OCD?
In other words, the dreams are so vivid and convincing that I'm not sure if it is actually a memory or a dream.

"Please bare with me guys I hope to explain myself but find this difficult.
Lately around here all I have heard is about young people or people who aren't old dying of cancer. :crybaby: Now as a rule I don't or ever have suffered from health related OCD. My first experience of a young death from Cancer was a few weeks ago. I didn't know the girl personally but know of her family and I would see this girl nearly everyday taking her little boy to school. Her name was Erica and she lost her battle against cervical cancer. When I would see her I would think how brave she was and things like 'what must she be thinking/going through'. She knew her cancer was terminal and the last time I saw her was just a fortnight before her death with her little boy on the school yard.
A lady who I used to bother with quite a bit and lives around by me lost her fight against cancer after only 6 weeks and I went to her funeral yesterday. It was extremely moving. She had choosen her own hymns and such. She was a single mum who has left 2 girls aged 24 years old approximately and a daughter of 17 years old. She was only 52. I knew she was ill cause someone told me but wouldn't tell me what was wrong so I didn't know until she had actually died.
Now there is a young girl just a few minutes walk from here. She only about 24 years old. She has a little boy who is less than 2. Again I don't know her personally but she has grown up around here and I know off her family. She got married at the local cancer hospital just a few weeks ago. She is now home, with a hospital bed and my neighbour told me there is no hope.
I can't stop thinking about all this stuff. Playing their situations over and over in my mind. Thinking about the sufferers, their family and friends. I also feel guilty that its not me. Of course I am glad its not. I wouldn't want to leave my children especially knowing that my time was limited. The way I feel at present it's like I almost expect it to happen to me. I know statistically that a lot of people live out their day to old age. I hope I am one of them. I have 2 special needs children and if anything happened to me or hubby there is really no one to take them. :crybaby:
I have talked about these ladies to my hubby and best mate and although they think it's sad they don't seem to give it another thought and just carry on. I know thinking on these things and dwelling on them isn't going to change anything but I can't stop or even feel selfish for not thinking about these things.

"Hello,
Recently, my math teacher noticed that I have difficulty focusing in class which may be a cause of my less than great academic performance. I got a D on his first test and I basically had an emotional breakdown in the room afterward and told him about my problems and he said to talk to my doctor. So I met with him yesterday and we decided to amp me up to 100mg of Zoloft (as opposed to the 50mg I've been taking for well over a year now) and while this bothers me a little bit I'm hoping it can help my inattentiveness which I put down to anxiety and OCD. I've always been that way now that I see it.
Also, I'm finally starting to be able to go out and don't have to feed my friends lame excuses as to why I can never do anything due to my many fears, one in particular. Cheers to hopefully having a life soon :clapping:
I'm not nearly as depressed as I was last month and see things going in a positive direction. I feel in a good mood a lot of the time which is good and On the other hand I tend to get really jealous particularly easily sometimes for no reason. Usually it can have to do with anything but especially:
-People with more money than me
-People with more of a life
-People with better grades
-People with more visible talents
-People with all of the above
Often, these can lead to feelings of inferiority that I know are false. Wishing I had what they do isHere's an example. One classmate of mine came from a school basically for people with money (which I got rejected from, causing some major mental damage), he is in classes years ahead of our year with flawless grades, money, and still manages to lead a club, participate in one, play a sport and instrument. I always think """"""""why them and not me?"""""""" I know a lot of people like that that seem perfect, that's just the prime example. I do tend to feel this way whenever someone surpasses me in anything. Although I like my school, I wish I were accepted there and always get jealous of them. I guess I wish I didn't have to face rejection. I know some of this must be OCD feelings due to the occasional lack of logic and amount of rumination, but how do you not get jealous when some people seem to have it all?

"This article was written by Professor Paul Salkovskis from the University of Bath and Ashley Fulwood from OCD-UK and was first published during OCD Awareness Week 2011, October 2011.
  Effective Treatment for an Unnecessary Illness: Where's mine?
In previous themes in OCD Awareness Week, it has been shown that OCD is a devastating and destructive problem which causes massive damage to the quality of life of both sufferers and those closest to them. It has been pointed out that, far from being an incurable disease, OCD can be eliminated with the right treatment delivered properly and with care and respect for the sufferer. We have summarised this by indicating that OCD is an UNNECESSARY DISEASE. This fact is recognised in various places, but perhaps most notably in the NICE guidelines for the identification and treatment of OCD published in 2005:
Now, this should be really good news because providers of NHS treatments are supposed to both share this information regarding best practice with service users and follow such guidelines unless the service user wishes to consider other options for their treatment once they have been informed of the options.
More than that, NICE itself specifically identified NHS priorities for people with OCD thus:
Early recognition, diagnosis and effective treatment
Information about the nature of OCD and treatment options
Respect and understanding
What to do in case of relapse
Information about support groups
Awareness of family/carer needs
And from the point of view of clinicians and therapists, NICE made the following suggestions:
Diagnosis:
Increase your awareness and recognition of symptoms of OCD - be aware of those at higher risk and how difficult initial disclosure is for many people with OCD
Ask the â€˜rightâ€™ questions â€“ assessment
Treatment:
Involve patients and when appropriate, family/carers, fully in treatment options
Offer CBT (including ERP)
If pharmacological treatment is required, regularly monitor side effects of SSRIs (self-harm and suicide)
Access to services:
Be aware of how to access specialist teams
Ensure you have access to local protocols
Training:
Identify your training needs in the use of CBT (including ERP) for OCD
Less therapist-intensive interventions have a rule to play, particularly in primary care
And for services and managers:
Actively disseminate the guidance
Carry out a baseline assessment
Develop and implement an action plan
Ensure CBT and specialist teams can be accessed appropriately
Identify professionals that require training or updating in CBT (including ERP) â€“ less-therapist intensive interventions have a rule to play, particularly in primary care
Include OCD within local education planning e.g. PTIs
Monitor and review
As usual and as might be expected from their thorough and carefully balanced methodology, NICE was spot on. At the time, all of this was fantastic news, and should have heralded a 'new dawn' for the earlier identification and better treatment of OCD.
So, six years later, have these guidelines been implemented? Perhaps here and there some notice may have been taken, but it is hard to escape from the conclusion that they have been almost entirely ignored by many or even most services. Nothing has really changed for most people with OCD and those developing it, which is either tragic or scandalous, depending on your viewpoint. As OCD Awareness Week and World Mental Heath Week comes to a close, we are forced to ask: Would such a situation be acceptable if the problem concerned were heart disease or cancer? If not, then why is it tolerated in Mental Health?
OCD-UK and others regularly hear the same message from those who contact them for help, which is that they know that treatment can be effective, they want and need it, but it is simply not available to them. With the investment in Improving Access to Psychological Therapies (IAPT) initiative there was a clear hope that things would improve for those less severely affected, and again in some places things have indeed improved, providing a tantalising vision of what can be achieved by this excellent programme. However it is now clear that OCD patients are under-represented in IAPT service provision and low intensity interventions may be over-used even when it would seem clear that they are unlikely to be helpful. Cost is of course an understandable driver, but at times it seems to be the main driver, which should not be allowed. Again this focus on starting with low intensity treatments would be fine if we were sure that this did not produce problems later when people are incorrectly regarded as having had a full course of CBT, and if the recommendations for those who do not respond to low intensity or unfocussed treatment are then 'stepped up' to more appropriate specialist treatment services. However, it is a fact that such services are very rare, usually requiring 'out of area treatment referrals' with cost implications which are unacceptable to service commissioners under financial pressure, and are often rejected at the mental well-being expense of the person with OCD.
There is a national specialist centrally funded service but this is entirely focused in the London area both in terms of units and provision of service, and is only open to a small number of people who meet overly strict criteria, including a requirement to accept several drug treatments with potentially very unpleasant side effects.   
It was noted in the previous OCD Awareness week themes that if we are going to beat OCD, then specialist and expert CBT treatment needs to be much more widely available, including intensive treatments and treatments offered in the personâ€™s locality, allowing home based treatments and involvement of their loved ones in the treatment as necessary. There is evidence that a great deal of time and effort and therefore money is squandered in a well meaning way on providing inappropriate treatment for those who, if offered the NICE recommended approach, would be able to overcome their OCD.  It is time for the NHS to stop providing ineffective and inappropriate treatment and increase the amount of specialist treatment properly delivered.
For those suffering from OCD and examining the excellent recommendations from NICE and other sources regarding what has to happen to make more appropriate treatment more available there is a question which many of us hear all too often. â€œI know treatment can work and change my life. Whereâ€™s mine?â€

"I've been on 30mg of this drug for quite a while but recently have started to really struggle. I've been doing ERP and dropping my rituals but I've found the feelings when I do are unbearable and I'm sick of doing the rituals. So over the past month I've increased to 100mg.
Is it normal to feel an increase in anxiety and obsessive thoughts when you first increase the dose? That's what's happening at the moment although I already can tell my mood has improved.
I'm wondering whether to carry on up to 150mg. That was the dose that my psychiatrist had in mind for me when he put me on the drug. Am I expecting too much to think that, on the right dose, clomipramine will make it so the thoughts don't bother me anymore and I have no anxiety about them?","['drop', 'Rituals', 'anxiety', 'anxiety', 'Thought']",['obsessive'],"['obsessive', 'anxiety', 'drop', 'Thought', 'Rituals']",,1.0,,,
"First, I'm new. Hello all. 30+ year OCD sufferer.
Can we all agree that:
- when humans repeat tasks, any tasks, we develop efficiencies. We do the task faster, more easily, with less effort.
With me so far? OK.
When we OCD sufferers feel the desire to do a new ritual for the first time, we do it in a relatively """"""""normal"""""""" way. We take a tissue and clean bird poop from the door handle of our car, for example. It requires X amount of mental activity to do it.
We feel relieved, and in our mind we subconsciously equate X amount of mental activity to Y amount of relief.
OK?
Now, 2 days later, it gets contaminated again. We do the ritual again the same way physically that we did it the first time, but this time, it required less mental activity since we just did it 2 days ago.
Now, doubt sets in. Our subconscious mind wonders if we should really be feeling Y amount of relief since we used less than X amount of mental effort to perform the ritual.
So we redo the ritual, this time trying to use as much mental effort to perform the ritual as the first time. Even though we can't see any bird poop, we take a tissue and wipe the door handle again. We concentrate more. Then we feel Y relief.
Again we associate X amount of mental activity with Y amount of relief, except that in order to do X amount of mental activity we have to increase our perfection in doing the ritual.
This leads us to a series of escalatingly difficult rituals. The pattern is that we want to use our mind X amount so that we get Y amount of relief. But to get our minds used X amount we have to continually improve the perfection of the ritual.
Yes? Do any or most of you feel the same way at this point?
One possible solution, then would be to train our subconscious minds to realize the efficiencies we are capable of while we are actually doing the rituals each time.
Recently, when performing rituals, I mentally note how much more efficient I am at doing them than I was the last time I did them. I tell myself that the thing is getting as clean as before, but it is easier to clean it because I'm becoming more and more efficient. I'm doing the ritual faster. In turn the ritual is taking up less time in my life. Because I mentally noted the efficiencies while doing the ritual, doubt is less likely to set in later.
No, this doesn't eliminate OCD from my life, unfortunately, but seems to be lessoning the impact.
Any comments or suggestions would be appreciated.
Thanks.

"I am curious about ocd thoughts being ego dystonic. I dont mean to spike anyone and this isnt distressing me but I dont think its correct to say people with ocd will never act on their thoughts as they are ego dystonic. Yes this us true for most cases, but there are grey areas. I had crippling Hocd for 2 years but also had genuine same sex attractions. I lost the fear when I went and had a gay relationship and I was happy after that, I now identify as bisexual. Ocd did open up a side of me I would never ever had explored otherwise. I also have intrusive suicidal thoughts occasionally, I know its ocd because of the fear. But I also have real suicidal feelings sometimes and have attempted it a few times. These are just 2 examples but I have heard more. Obviously the aim is to live with the uncertainty and possibility anyway, but because of the statement that this never happens with ocd, I find it quite damaging. The human mind is so complex, I dont believe its one or the other (ocd or not) because they can overlap.

So latly I have been extremely obsessing over if I pooped myself... I know it sounds so stupid but the fear is overwhelming. What happened recently was I have started this new medication and it really hasn't been going well with my stomach and I basically sharted and a little soiled my underwear and believe you me this caused a terrible spike in my ocd. I've been focusing way to much now. I don't know if I can take too much more of this. I can't even enjoy my day. All I think about is this fear. I then check myself with alcohol wipes to make sure and checking now is about every 40 minutes to ease my anxiety.

"Hi everyone. Hope your well. 
  Just looking for for some advice on this situation as I've just finished nightshift and instead of sleeping I'm compulsively googling about food safety. This morning my dad put the stew on which was in the fridge defrosting for a full 24 hours. It was stuck together I noticed which freaked me out as I thought it wasn't defrosted but he said it was and it sometimes just sticks but I think he's lying. Anyway it gets worse he then starts breaking the stew apart with his hands I felt so scared I could have cried! I never eat things he cooks or directly touches as he isn't clean although he did say he had washed his hands. So in my mind I'm now saying no way am I eating that. So tonight when I go to nightshift I'll be starving. Hate how normal people don't bother with things like this and I'm all worked up.

"My OCD was largely concerned with germs and contamination issues and exploded into my life in 2000. I was housebound for a time, spent hours every day washing my hands and cleaning and was out of work for 8 years ..... even then I wasn't 100% better but well enough to work if I made a few concessions to my fears.
I have worked for nearly nine years, in an office environment, and over those years my OCD fears have continued to wane - though never going completely.
Having left work, I now volunteer in a hostel for homeless men and women - it is probably somewhere which couldn't be further from anywhere I ever imagined I would ever be able to work. I work in the reception and have some direct contact with the residents themselves as well as contact with pens, mugs, chairs, equipment, door handles etc etc - all the things I, for years, avoided or cleaned - either the equipment or myself following even the smallest contact.  The only concession I make is to have some baby wipes in my car and after my shift, I clean my hands when I get in the car. I am then able to go on to the supermarket or wherever I need to go. i don't have to go home to wash. I don't have to clean my car keys, bag, steering well, pedals (oh yes - they were often cleaned) and so on. I have some handwash in my bag when I am there but I have never yet used it.
In the first eight or so years of my illness - particularly the first three - I never thought I would be well enough to live a 'normal' life and now I do just that!
Don't give up - it may be a long road but you really can recover. Take all and any help offered - I had years of talking therapy and am still on medication.

"I have always thought there was a link for my husband. He had very, very early onset OCD.
He was adopted, and was a sicky baby from the start. He almost died almost every night for the first couple of weeks his parents got him home. His lungs were terrible. They had to hold him in the bathroom with the hot shower steam running just to keep him breathing. They sometimes did this for hours at night. It was terrifying for them of course.
Although he got better than that, he did battle asthma and infections his whole childhood and still has a lot of trouble breathing.
I went through a wierd period in my life where I think I may have displayed OCD symptoms. For about 1 year of my childhood after having a few incidences of strep infections over the course of a few winters, I developed the need to do certain rituals before turning off light switches, etc. Basic OCD stuff.

"Hi
It's been a long time since my last post .It was a theme about bees.This one has also to do with insects and more specifically with ants.
Two days ago i fell to their nuptial flight day.Getting out of the house in the morning there was a swarm of winged ants over the stairway that leads to my garden flying as their reproduction day requires.Trying to go to my car i found a lot of them over its surface.But the worse was that they suddenly got over me.
Their practice of reproduction makes them extremely contaminated for my ocd as happened with the queenbee and the drones on my last post.I expected it was the same practice here as with the bee and when i checked it on wikipedia i found that unfortunately i was right.While i was trying to see what happens they got into my house from the door i left open.Even my ocd condition is improved with the combination of medicaments and cbt i felt the discomfort increasing.I found them even to the second floor where i sleep.
Nevertheless during these two days i didn't wash the stairway,the floor of the house,my car and i continue to wear the same contaminated clothes(it was my last clear trousers before they land on it and my central ocd laundry is far away from here) when i go out.I just threw the insects to the rubbish,and did all the works i had to do that day making room for the discomfort inside me.At the evening i went to the sea to swim and coming back i had the usual after sea shower.
The issue is the discomfort decreases slowly and today i gave in a bit and went to the all over the country congress of entomology.By coincidence it takes place these days in the small touristic town i stay the last years.I wanted to check the informations i collected from internet (yes i know reassurance.........).I found the president of the Greek entomologists and asked him as well as other members of the congresss about the ants .Their answers agreed with the internet and of course they fueled my ocd.Now i write it down, the discomfort decreases but with a very slow rythm..........

"Hi everyone
I am on my 5th week of ERP and have found it hard going, but I have been making progress. I am, however, a little stuck this week my homework is to hoover the whole house without wearing disposable gloves and not washing my hands afterwards. That in itself would me a massive step. My main problem with it aside for the fact of all the things I will have to touch to complete this task the hardest will be moving my cat's litter tray and rug. How can I move these bare handed and then not wash my hands. I will be expected later on to eat with my fingers as that was a previous homework.
Any advice, I don't know what to do, I just can't bring myself to try it, at the same time I don't want to let anyone down.

"Hi everyone!
The theory of OCD states that each time you do a ritual you get immediate relief, but this also trains your brain to respond to this situation with more anxiety next time, so doing rituals makes things worse in long term, right?
So the main idea of CBT treatment is to stop doing rituals.
I'm practicing ERP for a few years, so I refrain from doing both physical and mental rituals (mostly ), and it really helps.
However, the anxiety still stays with me.
For example if I touch a door knob in a public restroom which, as my OCD believes, is contaminated, I feel the urge to wash my hands.
So I treat this situation as exposure, and I don't wash my hands
However, as I didn't do the ritual, I believe I might just got some illness, and I feel very anxious and obsessed for some time, until the anxiety gradually diminishes by itself (everything as CBT says, right? )
So each time after I use a public restroom, I feel anxious for, let's say, half an hour.
Moreover, restrooms is not my only problem.
Fortunately for my OCD, I'm very creative in asking """"""""What if"""""""" questions, so I have lots of other anxiety triggering situations in my everyday life.
As a result I feel terribly anxious and obsessed most of the day.
ERP is really helpful in making you free from endless rituals, but how can it help with endless anxiety?

"Hi
I did CBT a while ago and, as it was a group session, I mainly only learnt about and practised ERP. I found it really effective and was told that this was the best way to beat OCD. We didn't do much taking therapy.
However recently I have decided that I need to revisit CBT and have also started reviewing the information on the OCD UK site. I started reading the four steps. However I am wondering whether the four steps and ERP are mutually exclusive I.e can you only practice one or the other but not both?
Although they both seem to have overarching similarities (not performing compulsive behaviours) they seem to approach it from different angles. ERP requires you to focus on the intrusive thought and drive up anxiety. Whereas the four steps (particularly step 3 - refocus) seems to be more a way of focusing on something different whilst creating a time delay and reminding yourself that the thought is due to OCD which is a medical condition.
Just wondering whether there is a conflict here? Am I missing something? Has anybody used both? And if so, was this effective?

"Yesterday I ;posted a piece about my phobia with heights - and escalators hanging over voids.
On a training trip to Lloyd's of London I faced up to my phobia with the escalators and , after the training, reacquainted myself with The Nelson Collection - priceless memorabilia of Admiral Lord Nelson.
It's been a desperately busy year for me professionally, but a hiatus today meant I had the opportunity to take a 90-minute break at lunchtime; so I elected to both carry out some more ERP, and get even closer to my hero Viscount Horatio Lord Nelson.
My destination would be the magnificent St Paul's Cathedral, about 20 minutes walk from my office, then a short bus ride home.
The ERP involved potential triggers to my OCD thoughts - headlines, posters with violent themes - and climbing up to the """"""""whispering gallery """""""" inside the dome!!!
The walk through the City of London waswonderful, but uneventful OCD-wise, no triggers spooked me , so great.
The cathedral has been cleaned and renovated inside and out - you would not know its some 300+ years old, it looks fabulous.
They charge £16 to visit, but there is no charge to attend a religious service.
The cathedral is an old friend to me, so I had certain targets to visit. First I wanted to see again the priceless pre-Raphaelite paining """"""""The Light Of The World"""""""" by William Holman Hunt. I found it now has become an alter piece in a lovely little side chapel.
The original picture, much smaller, hangs in Keeble college, Oxford. The life-size version in St Paul's was painted towards the end of Hunt's life.
I happen to know, as a hobby student of fine art, that the model who sat for Hunt to paint the figure of Christ was actually a girl!!!! The picture is allegorical, representing the need for people to have to want Christ to enter their lives; its well worth """"""""googling"""""""" to get the full story of the allegory behind the picture.
I then took on the ERP challenge of climbing 257 steps to the gallery inside the dome. It's a 30-metre drop from the railing to the cathedral floor below but - eureka - this caused no anxiety today!.
It's called the whispering gallery because if you say a word to one side of you when in the gallery, it will pass around the gallery and come right back to your other ear!
Down the stairs, across the cathedral quire (choirstalls0 and there is another fabulous work of fine art, """"""""mother and child"""""""" by sculptor Henry Moore - carved in stone.
Down the stairs into the crypt and I could (at last for me because when I tried before it was closed due to the 300 year celebration of the Battle of Trafalgar) I was at Admiral Lord Nelson's elaborate tomb - it lies immediately below the dome, within the crypt space.
Close by Nelson lies another hero of the Napoleonic wars, Arthur Duke of Wellington, victor over Napoleon at the Battle of Waterloo - and also close by in another little chapel lies Fieldmarshall Montgomery of El Alamein, the second world war hero.
A short walk into the chapel dedicated to the Order of the British Empire (OBE) and I could pay my respects once again to he who created this fabulous global iconic building, architect Sir Christopher Wren. Near where he lies is inscribed in latin the words (composed by his son) which translate as - famously -"""""""" if you seek his monument, look around you"""""""".
A short bus ride back to the office, without getting spooked by triggers, and a Cornish pasty for lunch completed a fabulous 90 minutes.
When I visit a church/cathedral, an overwhelming peace surrounds, then absorbs into me - I'm still in that lovely, rerlaxed place right now as I write.
By the way, its not only Lords, Admirals, Dukes, Field Marshalls, famous writers and therapists that can be my heroes.

"Hi,
Im going to write to my gp now on email. i got a mail from him with a offer about erp.
Well, some of you may heard bit of this before (sorry to repeat myself!), but here we go..
Im on waiting list to a theraphy with ocd, where you get hospitalized in some weeks and gets both erp and cognetive theraphy. They also have experience with my main issue, and i really hope this will be great for me. But it can take a year to wait, hopefully less.
The offer i got now is just erp in few sessions. I tryed a similar program some moths ago, nearly a year, and i got really really ill. i ended up moving, selling my lace, and cant touch my things from that place i lived. I sold my car and dont drive anymore.
I think erp alone for me isnt good. I think i need mostly cognetive therapy and take the problem by its roots, and off course erp could be helpful too, but nor alone.
I really dont know what to write to my gp. He said he dont know much about ocd, and seems to me very unsecure and said hes not sure if he can help me. So i dont know if i trust him to take the cognitive part. I feel safer about the hospetalizasion where they have experts on my theme, cause i have bad experiences with theraphist who dont know the subject. (religious, and a priest/theraphist i trust more)
I dont know what to write to my gp. I never told how much my last erp costed me, like i have written here. I really have found it hard to talk about because of alot of anxiety. Maybe ill find it easier to write it. (even though it seems more scary in my own language).
I dont want to seem not willing to get help and not thankfull for him working for this erp offer. But I really have a bad feeling about this, and am not sure about erp without the cognitive part is right for me. Last time i really felt we were in a hurry, and should take all my higest anxiety and ocd issues in 2-4 sessions, and i think they should taken the time to talk to me as well, and maybe the mapping wasnt good enogh either. Cause i dont think its justifiable to do like they done when i were so ill i barly could eat, but had all opertinities to get well with work, car, home.. it was a bad experience. I just dont know if i find the words to write why i find cognitive so importent, even thogh i think i have lots of arguments.
Can it be some people dont find erp usefull without the cognetive part? I feel it helpes me to get sorted my thoughts. And i feel the erp is much easier sometimes when i have talked about it. Sometimes i guess i dont even need erp, cause i will get there by changing the way of thinking..
Still, i got an offer, and im going to write an email now. I think i should be critical and take responibillity for myself after all i been throgh this year. But how far can i get to insist on getting the threatment i belives in, and to get some quality threatment. Do someone else feel they need the cognitive part as well to beat ocd.

"Just curious, I have never heard of another person with this type, maybe certain parts of it, but not the whole theme.
My OCD has always centered around a fear of something happening to my loved ones, such as my mom dying in a car crash (when I was younger) or currently, one of my kids getting a terminal illness.
However, lately it seems that my theme has kid of morphed into a general fear that I can tell the future. That somehow, my OCD is really just me being very intuitive or psychic. I feel like many of the dreams I have come true, and I have a great fear that some of the dreams I have had about cancer mean that my son will get it.
I often feel like I am so scared of my children dying from cancer because intuitively I know that they will. So, generally I feel like my overall theme has kind of become a fear of being psychic, I don't want to be, but I am constantly obsessing and ruminating and thinking about it, convinced that I am and scared to death.
I would say it's kind of a weird mixture of fear of being psychic, fear of something happening to my loved ones, health anxiety and super control freak all mixed into one.
Just wondering if anybody has come across anything like this.","['rash', 'anxiety', 'anxiety', 'OCD', 'fear']",['theme'],"['anxiety', 'fear', 'rash', 'theme', 'OCD']",1.0,,,,
"Have you ever run into someone that might also have OCD? Especially ocd that's similar to yours? I have on two occasions...that I recall. There's got to be more then that in total though since OCD is pretty """"""""common"""""""" now. It's just that some OCD behaviors are easier to hide then others so you might not be able to tell by looking at the person. I'm sure if I paid more attention I would see more people with OCD in this world. Going back to my encounters with people whom I suspect to be OCD sufferers, I'll mention the one that happened yesterday...
So last night I picked up some snacks after my gym workout, yes I know, what's the point of working out if I'm going to ruin it by stuffing my face with chips afterwards??? So anyway, saw this guy in the checkout line while I was looking at chips. He was trying to buy some shower gel and I overheard him say that he didn't have enough money and that he'll be back. When it was my time to check out I saw him again, this time in the line in front of me. He was telling the checkout guy that now he thinks he has enough and then he started counting the money. And he dropped a quarter... and he said """"""""oh now I don't have enough"""""""", and looked sad and sounded worried. I thought the coin got stuck somewhere underneath the checkout stand but it was right there on the floor, next to him, just rolled a little bit to the side, closer to the counter. And he said again """"""""oh no now I don't have enough anymore"""""""" or something to that effect. I pointed to the coin and said """"""""it's right there."""""""" And then he was like """"""""oh okay"""""""", and thanked me and picked it up. And said some blah blahs, which I didn't pay attention to as I don't usually if it doesn't concern me. It was more about money, etc. I just nod nod nod. The odd thing is, I could have sworn that he saw the coin but didn't want to pick it up because it was on the floor. When he dropped it, he was kinda acting like that's the end of it. Something inside me said """"""""Oh this is kinda familiar..."""""""", except for his loud talk. That didn't seem familiar at all. lol. But I just shrugged it off.
There was another customer in front of both of us and that guy was giving a candian or english coin (lol!) as part of his payment to the checkout person. And the checkout guy was like """"""""oh sorry but this one has queen Elizabeth on it"""""""", smiles, """"""""hehe"""""""" And because of the way he said it, with the queen part, rather then something like """"""""this isn't a US coin sir"""""""" or something more mundane, i started snickering and the """"""""OCD guy"""""""" in front of me was laughing too. When it was his turn to pay, he was telling the cashier that he's glad he's found the money and that he had bought new clothes this week so he thought he'd spent all his money. FYI, he isn't a homeless person or looked """"""""poor"""""""". He rather look like someone who would buy inexpensive clothes and would buy them frequently.
I thought hmm new clothes...and I started putting things together... the way he was acting when he dropped the money (he looked very concerned), how he's only buying one item and it's showergel, and he's talking about buying new clothes this week and just his overall mannerism told me that he probably has some degree of OCD... and it's the kind that's probably similar to mine... I just got a feeling about it. For me, these days I can pick up coins and I'm not as compulsive in buying showergels and cleaning products but I've been at a stage where I would make late night trips to the grocery store just to buy a showergel and how that trip was sometimes really hard. And I'd get anxious if I drop any money cus I couldn't pick it up. Also I would pretend that I didn't know where it went. If someone picks it up for me or point it out, I'd say thanks but felt embarrassed and even more anxious.
I wouldn't babble on like this guy did though... And I wouldn't be admitting to cashiers that I just bought new clothes hence why I don't have enough money and so on. Anyway, so I have changed from that but when I saw how he was behaving, I felt so bad for him, for looking soo worried. Also for myself for being reminded that it was kinda like that for me also. I went over it in my head a couple of times today, wishing that I could have picked up that quarter for him and exchange it for him with a quarter from my bag, a """"""""clean"""""""" one. Let him know with my eyes that I understand. I know it would't help him beat the OCD (if he has it and I think he does) but it would have been a nice gesture. I wish someone could have done that for me...but instead all I got were laughs and head shakes. And a whole lot of gossips. All I felt for this guy was sympathy and wish that I could help him. How could people not feel that too when they recognize that someone has OCD? Why don't they get it that the person is suffering soo much and why won't they try to befriend them and try to be of some help, rather then talk a lot of **** about that person. I don't mind if they help you and gossip too, as long as the help part is there. But just to gossip and spread it around just further isolates the person and hurt their feelings.
So anyway, I just wanted to get my feelings out there and vent a little bit. I hope it wasn't too boring and too """"""""obsessive"""""""". If you have any thoughts about it or want to post your own experiences, please go right ahead.

"Hi all:)
I was just wondering if anything can relate and maybe give me some help? Ok so basically most of my thoughts become rituals and I find it so hard to cope with at times. For example, i have been with my partner for nearly 2 years and like every couple ups and downs however he is such a beautiful person inside and out and i truly am mad about him. However, due to my ocd and anxiety i find myself constantly having to ritual that everything is ok and that we are fine but now that i am trying to confront my ocd i am finding it really difficult to stay calm and say to myself its ok. We communicate so well and i know in my heart that there is nothing wrong however OCD keeps these rituals going and constantly testing me:( Even my calming thoughts are becoming rituals and are making me uncomfortable. It is so hard to separate reality from ritual. This is just one example this happens with everything like my job, family and even how i eat! So i was just wondering if anyone has any advise on this or has similar to me please post or even message me because i would love too hear from you.
Thanks,

"Hi
Not been here for a while, I've been managing very well with keeping myself busy and not getting scared when I do occasionally get a nasty though.
I'm just going through an unpleasant phase now of my brain connecting lots of my thoughts/things I do with something disgusting. For example, if I move my tongue in my mouth, my brain will pretty quickly connect that to a sexual image. This happens with many, many things.
I know the only way to make this happen less is to not let it affect me, but it's just annoying that I was doing so well. It feels like a step back! Not to mention how disturbing it is. I hate that my OCD always has to latch onto sexual themes, it makes me feel so disgusting.

"This is my first post on here, and I'm sort of freakishly nervous about it... forums are usually scary places, but I'm going to try.
My boyfriend suffers from OCD, and knows a fair amount more than I do.
My thought processes I've had my whole life, match those recurrent with OCD.
For instance, """"""""If you don't do this, your car will crash,"""""""" """"""""If you don't do this, your mother will die."""""""" Thus, I automatically do it, and the voices go away - but after beginning to fight it, and realize that it's connected or is a result of my OCD, they've been getting more angrier, and scarier... something I never realized until now, because I never fought against the voices. I just thought it was normal, and everybody hears that sort of stuff - and that's why they do things?
That, or if I see something or do something, I might have to do it again because it doesn't feel 'right'... if that's understandable.
But, I'm scared that, since my boyfriend suggested I have OCD, and since I've looked more thoroughly into the subject, that I'm merely noticing rituals more because I'm paranoid I have it?
Apart from that, rituals have become more serious, and nearly every one has turned into some form of self harm..
For instance, I'll just be rubbing my arm until I feel like I don't need to anymore, but I've noticed I've been rubbing harder, until I start scratching.
Or I'll start hitting things so many times, and it's become noticeable to other people around me that I've been doing things like this now. Before, if I ever did something I wouldn't call it a ritual, because I never knew I had OCD (if I have it, I suppose)... but now, I'm paranoid everyone will find out, and ostracize me for it.
I've told my mother about it, and she keeps bringing up awkward things, trying to explain everything I do strange in great amounts of detail, trying to coerce me out of my phobias because she thinks it's all connected to my supposed OCD (which I doubt she believes I have).
I just keep getting so frustrated with myself all the time, and I feel like a complete failure.. I'm scared it's getting worse and I really don't know what to do, cos I know for a fact that my boyfriend isn't always going to be there to save me in case something terrible happens.

"This is going to be long winded post, as I've got so much going on in my head, and I just need to get it down!!
Some may be aware that I suffer with contamination OCD, especially around bodily fluids. For the past year, I have been in control of my OCD, and have been leading a happy life. I finally overcame my 'final' hurdle in recent weeks when I got 2 kittens as pets. Even though I was in charge of my OCD, I still 'avoided' having any pets because I was concerned they may trigger my OCD again. I've been dealing with kittens really well, and not had any contamination issues around them....until now!!
For the last 10 days I have been living in a nightmare with all 3 of my children down with a very nasty case of gastroenteritis. I have experienced quite a few tummy bugs in my life as a parent, but never one like this. 2 of my children needed hospital care, as they got really poorly. They got severely dehydrated, as they couldn't keep even water down, and they got extremely weak. It was a frightening experience, and I can honestly say, at one point I was concerned that my son may not make it, as he was really that poorly.
Thankfully, 10 days down the line, my children are recovering....and I am so happy to hear them arguing amongst themselves. However, my kittens now have the runs!! I have spoken to the vets this morning, and they say that it seems like my children may have passed the gastroenteritis bug. So I am now cleaning up after poorly kittens!
Anyway, things are going hectic in my mind.... The vet seems to think the children passed it onto the kittens (apparently it can happen in cats with sensitive stomachs, and kittens), so I'm now worrying the kittens can pass it back to the children, and I will never be away from this bug. Another thing that is going through my mind is that when the doctors were examining my son, in the space of the initial 10 minutes assessment, he sprayed his hands at least 10 times. Everytime he touched my son, he cleaned his hands.
So I'm beginning to wonder if now I'm in control of my OCD that maybe I have been lapse in preventing bugs. I'm feeling that maybe I should be washing my hands more often....and not because they are feeling 'contaminated', but maybe I'm not just doing enough to prevent illnesses in my children.
I'm starting to feel I have to wash my hands everytime I touch my kittens, as they may pass the bugs back onto me and therefore onto my children.
I was so so desperate not to get anxious over the cats, but it's starting to happen. Rehoming the kittens isn't an option...one because it would be giving in....there are so many people in the world who have cats as pets, and lead healthy lives.....and also because they were presents for my daughters. How can I take them away so soon after giving them to them.
I have slowly been withdrawing from medication. I am down to 10mg Seroxat. I was due to stop them last week, but with the children being so poorly, I didn't feel it was the right time to stop taking them...so I've got to do it this week instead.
Sorry I've waffled, just lots going on in my head.

"Hello,
I don't know whether I've got OCD or not, so I'm often scanning symptom lists to see how many match with what I think and do.
A word I often come across when reading information about OCD is """"""""excessive"""""""". Obviously, I know what the word means, I just wonder, in practice, how much time do you have to spend doing something for it to be considered excessive and a symptom of OCD?
For example, I once saw, in a long list of possible symptoms, """"""""excessive list making"""""""". How often would you have to make lists for this behaviour to be considered excessive? Excessive is more than is usual or necessary. I have been known to make a few lists, and the average person probably only makes shopping lists or to-do lists, so my list-making is more than is necessary or normal, but the word """"""""excessive"""""""" makes it sound very extreme, like someone's making lists every 5 minutes!
Also, the 'guideline' times some websites give confuse me a bit. In the OCD action 'Do I have OCD?' quiz, it gives you options of how frequently unpleasant thoughts/images enter your head, giving, for example, 'moderate' as 'one to three hours'. Would this be thinking a particular thought for hours straight, or is that cumulative hours during the day?","['hopping', 'site', 'Thought', 'OCD', 'symptom']",['excessive'],"['site', 'hopping', 'Thought', 'excessive', 'symptom', 'OCD']",,1.0,,,

"Hi, I just wondered if anyone else gets this or if its just me and my constitution. I was thinking it may be caused by excessive fight or flight responses and adrenal and cortisol production. I tend to need 10-11 hours sleep every night and can easily have 12
also, I have this thing where I feel so dissatisfied with what i've achieved in the day that I cant let go at night time and end up staying up till 3am trying to make up for it, otherwise if i go to bed I will feel like I've wasted my day and really depressed
the thing is, its a vicious circle because if i go to bed at 3am I may not get up till 1am and that feels terrible, then if I was to try to get an early night that night, firstly would fint it impossible to sleep till I had been up for between 15-16 hours and I would have had an 11 hour day
I can't go from waking to sleeping, I need to be up for that long before I feel ready to sleep but if I wake up after only 8-9 hours my body feels like lead and if I force myself to get up I feel really sleepy throught the day.
I have been known to go full circle before and force myself to stay up for 30 hours just to fix the pattern but inevitable it goes back round again because I cant sleep till I've had between 15-16 hours up but I find it really difficult to get up after only 8-9 hours

"I've never been officially diagnosed with OCD, but certain things in life have held me back so much, that I have always wondered if I am at the lower end of an OCD-related spectrum. While I am often over-anxious about catching a cold, especially when travelling on public transport (hate people sneezing or coughing next to me, never touch public buttons or rails, always crouch rather than sit on public toilet seats), I feel this is pretty normal for many people and it doesn't intrude on my life in any way.
However, what HAS held me back substantially from achieving all that I'd hoped to achieve, and what is still causing me great distress because of that, is my penchant for excessively tidying and ordering things. List-making is also pretty obsessive. At one time I was listing every item of clothing and shoes I have in my home, just for the sake of finding out what I need and what I dont need. The advent of computers took my filing and sorting to a new level, with endless folders on the computer needing to be sorted, and then to be sorted again within each folder. This was already the case with office files. Now it's the case with computer folders as well. And don't even mention the sorting of emails. It's basically taking up so much time in each day that I have little time left to do anthing productive, and I know exactly how crazy this sounds.
The interesting thing is that my need for order and tidiness doesn't extend to other people's things (thankfully!), so if I go to a friend's home, for example, I do not feel the need to tidy their place. It is only things that come into my possession, or that I own. So when mail comes for me, I put it in a pile and have to read it, then throw or file it. If I'm sharing a room with friends my 'place' is always ultra tidy, but it doesn't cause anxiety if theirs isn't. It I stay in a hotel room alone, I have to keep it tidy, and will even put all hotel brochures and cardboard ads into a drawer so as to keep the desks looking neat and tidy.
Being neat and tidy is a good thing, but when the related sorting of files and folders and the excessive list making takes over, is this OCD? We always hear of OCD relating to germs and washing, but very little is said about tidiness and order. Certainly, I believe that all OCD is related to excessive levels of anxiety, and would love to hear what others here think.","['sneezing', 'coughing', 'cough', 'toilet', 'hope', 'office', 'email', 'interest', 'anxiety', 'anxiety', 'OCD']","['excessive', 'obsessive']","['sneezing', 'anxiety', 'obsessive', 'OCD', 'office', 'email', 'interest', 'cough', 'toilet', 'excessive', 'coughing', 'hope']",,1.0,,,
"(Sorry this is quite long!)
I've been diagnosed with anxiety and referred for counselling but reading into it the issues that bother me seem to have a bit of an OCD crossover. There aren't any obvious rituals as such, it's purely thoughts based but excessive responsibility does seem to be a common OCD theme.
These beliefs I have have always bothered me on and off but I've always been able to rationalise it in the past.  However for the past 18 months I can't shake it off no matter what I do.
I'm also worried that this post could maybe cause anxiety in others who feel a heightened sense of responsible towards others wellbeing so please don't carry on reading if that's you!
  I seem to latch onto things I read in the media and worry excessively about them, one of my biggest fears is causing someone to have a heart attack by startling them say by making an error when driving (even really, really minor errors), or even just beeping a horn or appearing from round a corner when someone isn't expecting it etc. Writing this I can see how excessive this is but I can't shake the worry. I drudge up memories of specific events from the past from when I could've possibly made people jump (especially if they are older or weaker etc) and worry that they could have had a heart attack and worry that it would all be my fault. ? I think my anxiety has latched onto this idea as there's no way to find out if this could be a possibility or not so the doubt element is right up there to fuel the anxiety.
I've been trying to distract myself from worrying about it/going over events in my head as well as trying mindfulness and exercise and these things help but I can't seem to let go of these deep seated beliefs now.  It's totally affecting my self esteem as I feel that I don't deserve to relax or enjoy things. Like I said the rational side of me knows that other people wouldn't even give this a second thought but I can't let it go
I'd be keen to hear from others with similar anxieties, or anyone who has got over it and has any advice.

"Hello everyone
I haven't posted for a few weeks but really need to today. You might remember that I mentioned that I was going to start temping for a while. My major issues for the past while have been cleanliness and contamination (particularly, but not exclusively, accidentally ingesting alcohol).
I've now done almost 10 days of temping in two different offices. The first one was a nightmare - dingy, damp building, weird smell, generally feeling of griminess. Felt really awful and had that 'physical sensation' of contamination that is so uncomfortable. This is in addition to the stress of using someone elses stuff - computer, pens etc. Thankfully, that was only for four days. Finished up last Monday.
The second contract started last Wednesday and goes on til next Wednesday. Initially I thought I was doing pretty well. It was slightly easier than the first job since its in a bright, open-plan office. I'm not getting the chance to wash my hands as much which means that they are getting a chance to heal a bit, which is obviously a good thing.
However, I've begun to realise that the less chance I get to wash, the more my checking rituals have increased. These haven't been as much of an issue for me in the last 18 months or so, but they seem to have reasserted themselves with a vengeance. Its just become so difficult to 'walk away' from things again, particulary when its a job that other people are relying on me for.
Also, my need to 'confess' to every mistake I make is just exhausting. I just can't seem to do anything well enough. Constantly feel like something terrible is going to happen or will get fired.
I'm absolutely shattered today. Barely have the energy to get out of my seat. Body is aching and all I want to do is lie down on the bed - but can't do that because I have day-time clothes on :dry: (don't ask).
Just so angry and frustrated. But also don't really care (if that makes any sense).
Sorry for rabbitting on. Just really needed an outlet today.

"Hey everyone,

I was diagnosed with ocd in 2010 and have been struggling with it ever since.

I had a 7 week hospitalization from the 5th of December 2012 until January 26, 2013.

My ocd thoughts have always centered on the same theme. child molestation.

Atm my thoughts are about my boyfriend. He was accused of molestation but found not guilty. For the last few weeks I've been questioning in my mind all day every day on whether he did it or not. I even read through his court documents. Every time I would think I had found an answer to show he hadn't done it I would go """"""""but what if?"""""""" Now it's gotten to a place where I'm worried I believe the thoughts. I don't want to talk to him and when I do talk to him I tell him I would rather kill myself than have these thoughts about him.
Before I had these thoughts about him my thoughts were that I myself was a child molestor. I would rather hate myself than hate him. I was supposed to spend my life with him and we are so perfect for one another.

Medication has been a nightmare. I started on zoloft and this made me want to act on the thoughts so they took me of it. Next I tried anafranil. This gave me unbelievable side effects in its recommended dose so they had to cut it down. recently I've been trying lexapro and have been on it for almost four months. It was doing nothing until it was increased to 40mg. however a couple of weeks ago I had urges to kill myself and went to the hospital where I was told I had serotonin syndrome. They cut the lexapro back in half.
For the record the thoughts about my boyfriend didn't start until they cut my medication in half. Surely this can't be a coincidence can it?

Now I am stuck with a medication that doesn't work and my ocd levels are through the roof. is it possible to start believing ocd thoughts? Why can't ocd thoughts be fought with logic.

"Ok so my false memory OCD has all but disappeared which should be good news but I'm currently going through something that makes me feel even worse. I'm experiencing an out of it, dreamlike sensation that has been progressively getting worse, to the point where I don't even feel alive or human, it's like I'm doing things like getting dressed for example but it doesn't feel real, it's like I'm not real and nothing is real and it's scaring the hell out of me. At the same time I keep thinking how do I know that anything is real or is everything an illusion, I just feel so strange and unreal and I don't know what to do. I've had this feeling 3 or 4 times before but never this bad. My thoughts don't even make sense and I'm just all confused and stuff. The only reason it went away those last times was when my other themes came back. Has anyone else gone through this?

"Hi all,
Just a quick one. Has anyone ever had a fear of thinking things are real that blatantly aren't? Since suffering with derealisation recently I sometimes find myself with a spike from some really random stuff. Just now for example I saw a CGI wolf on the Twilight movie and for some reason got a spike from it. I think this is down to me having developed a fear of losing touch with reality and so I am scared to believe that daft stuff is real.
Of course OCD being what it is means that these thoughts can flash across my mind before I even realise it and lead to anxiety.
Although I had the anxiety reaction I just left it alone and it went away but it is so ridiculous.
I have also had anxiety resulting from the derealisation and a fear of psychosis and schizophrenia.
I spoke to my therapist as well as two mental health nurses about this today and they confirmed that it was just anxiety and that I was being hypervigilant because I was so scared of believing in false things and scared of being delusional.
I am not looking for reassurance but was just wondering if anyone had experienced such random fears as it is just such a far cry from my harm theme.
I am completely rational when these thoughts occur but my OCD goes mad with it at times. It is awful and I can really tie myself up in knots if I follow the existential thoughts which I know is the worst thing to do.
I am now using my CBT learnings to combat this new theme of thoughts and hope to just let them come and go and learn that they are just ridiculous thoughts that I dont need to be scared of.","['hope', 'OCD', 'fear', 'anxiety', 'anxiety', 'Thought']","['spike', 'theme']","['anxiety', 'OCD', 'fear', 'Thought', 'spike', 'theme', 'hope']",1.0,,,,
"Hi,
So as you may know from my previous posts, I went through a phase of wondering whether my entire reality is created within my mind. I think I am just about past this now, although, it does come back at times.
What's bothering me now is the whole issue of time and we only really have the present moment. Which is what got me involved in this stuff in the first place - this book my dad told me to read which freaked me out.
Like anything you ever look forward to, it always comes and it goes, doesn't it? Nothing lasts. So how can we really enjoy anything? If you listen to a song, you're just listening to moments and after moments, not an actual song.
Also, I keep getting the urge to ruminate about the whole, 'why are we here? why are there humans? Did we really evolve from bacteria over millions of years? Why was there such thing as bacteria? Why is there anything?'.
I know I need to just not think about it and refuse to engage with it, but it is so difficult at the moment.
Has anyone else ever gotten past existential themes? To a point where they can look back at it and think it was stupid? Really struggling to see how I will ever be able to let this go at the moment...","['joy', 'urge']",['theme'],"['urge', 'joy', 'theme']",1.0,,,,
"Has anyone battled with this particular theme? For me, it stemmed from my fear of schizophrenia and related crazy thoughts...I've always been a thinker in my life and pondering about the meaning of existence, our role in the universe etc. never bothered nor scared me.
With Ocd, however, it's a different thing, and these thoughts now scare me very much because I can't prove them 100% false as much as I try. Here are a few examples (possible trigger warning):
- What is life? What is a soul?
- Does God exists? If yes, what is His purpose?
- How do I know everything is real? I may be imagining everything
- How do I know I'm really alive? Maybe I'm already dead.
- What if this is a computer simulation created by an advanced race to test me?
- What if I'm the only one real and other people are an illusion, or actors, or automatons (Descartes solipsim theories)
Well I don't really believe the thoughts and I know that everything is real etc. but the nagging doubt, that 0,00000000001% possibility that things could be different makes my anxiety skyrocket, like it becomes 50% when I'm obsessing about it! Is it normal that when in the grip of anxiety the thoughts become more threatening? They feel more """"""""realistic""""""""?

"As always I'm posting from a personal perspective, hopefully sensitively (and helpfully) but with some experience as someone who was diagnosed with OCD 22 years ago, I think what I have to say is important.
I've had the A-Z of anti-depressants (some older with incredibly unpleasant side effects as do most), anti-psychotic medication and as regular forum friends know a long term dependency (being addressed) on tranquillisers.
I've read a lot of posts about specific medications and sense that sufferers of OCD desperately hope it will help which I 100 per cent respect and understand because I know the score.
In my personal life, the forum I use for my recovery from compulsive gambling has people recently talking about medication to help with the issue.
My point is please have realistic expectations about medication even when OCD is crippling you - believe me I have been there especially before forums like this existed and many useless voluntary hospital admissions. 
Positively if the medication IS helpful great.
Best wishes, Phil

"Many of you already know what type of OCD I suffer from and how much I have been suffering in the past months. So, I am not going to make this post about explaining my OCD theme. However, I would really like to discuss my emotions that are becoming highly wide ranging the past couple of weeks.
I feel like at certain moments I am clear and happy and feeling excited about the holidays and loving towards my husband. The next minute, I am depressed, desperately needing my husband around me for support and feeling like I just can't go on with my life like this. These high and low emotions are stressful. Though, the worst emotion I have been experiencing lately is anger. I'm not even sure why I feel angry. I get angry really easily at the moment and sometimes I just feel extremely angry towards my husband. I'm not sure if I'm actually angry at him or just taking out my anger on him.
I know that my OCD is causing me great amounts of frustration because I was doing well for a few weeks and now I am suffering again and feeling like it is getting worse. I'm not sure if my frustration due to my OCD is what is causing my anger..... but I just wanted to see if others here are experiencing such wide ranging emotions - like one minute feeling one way and the next feeling completely the opposite?
If you are experiencing these ranging emotions and especially anger please reply... I would really like to know how you cope with it and when you noticed it getting that way and if you feel it is due to your OCD.

"Been here a few times now trying to understand more about this disorder. What I don,t understand is how and why the changes occur and what triggers the thoughts/actions. Days go by and everything seems normal, conversations with family etc, and then boom, chit happens for reasons I can,t figure. The rituals,counting,checking and washing are brutal. Not sure how this disorder can magically appear and then seemingly disappear. The handwashing will never change I suspect as this for sure has been ever present just never been given a name in the past. But why or how I can disappear for hours into rituals is beyond me. When I finally wake up so to speak it,s amazing how embarrassing the rituals seem and the time that just disappears is frightening. I find myself literally thinking about a scenario or scenarios with endless outcomes, the whole time I am lost in a routine of repetitive stupidness without realizing what I am doing, how can something like this happen, is it ocd. I know from reading about this disorder that it can take many shapes and forms for everyone. Lost in thoughts for hours is not something I have ever done in my entire life. I have not been officially diagnosed with OCD. Was a grief counsellor that initially suggested possible ocd. Been on a fact finding mission of late and these actions/routines are frustrating to say the least.

Exploring the impact OCD has on romantic relationships
The purpose of this study is to explore the impact that OCD has on romantic relationships. This is a relatively under researched area in comparison to other aspects of OCD. OCD in its nature can be very invasive and this is often felt by those closest to the sufferer. As romantic relationships are important in terms of support and understanding when tackling a mental health issue, it is therefore prudent to consider the impact on the non- sufferer. In some cases people rely heavily on the support of their spouse and understanding the challenges that they face as caregivers there is a possibility that OCD can be understood from an alternative perspective.
I am a third year undergraduate student studying Psychology and counselling studies. I am hoping to interview five people who are romantically involved with an OCD sufferer. I am hoping to conduct the interviews face to face and they will last approximately one hour. The interviews will be then analysed and key themes will be extracted for observation. The findings have the potential to offer a different view on life with OCD, and will hopefully encourage a deeper understanding of the condition. Protecting anonymity will be paramount throughout the process.
How My Research will be undertaken:
I will be conducting five interviews with five different participants where I will ask questions and find out more about experiences of OCD and its impact on romantic relationships. The interview data will be used for analysis and key themes extracted, in order to understand the experience of being in a relationship with an OCD sufferer.

"Just posting again as I have some specific questions/recent experiences and wanted to put them down to see what others here thought.
I have posted here before relating to my Contamination issues in terms of controlling my environment and possessions from contamination (namely from anything that may or has been in contact with bodily fluids-urine/excrement).
Anyway I am currently staying with my girlfriend in Romania where she works. The thing is I am staying in her flat with a dog that is not house trained....so am experiencing some pretty intense exposure, and cannot carry out the rituals as much as at home. Fortunately for me, my girlfriend understands to a certain extent and does not expect me to clean up after the dog, just walk him. My point is that with this exposure here, those worries of contamination from less direct exposure, at home seem to be paling in comparison to this.
This exposure is quite far down my hierarchy list, and whilst I don't like it, I suspect this is doing me some good in some way. I have had cognitive therapy already and have had 14 sessions with a CBT therapist now. I still don't fully understand exposure, but understand that by gradually getting positive examples where you have combatted OCD and felt OK it then assists as you work down your hierarchy. Now that I am dealing with living with an untrained dog, and taking it outside for walks etc, and coming into contact with it, this to a certain extent seems to have made other fears reduce.
My question is will this change when I return back home, or is it possible that this will have a lasting effect, and give me more resilience to the OCD back at home? I am hoping that this will be the case, and that I will not revert back to past habits. This is a hard question I know, but just wondered if anyone has experience of this. The other thing is that the CBT Therapist said I responded better to gradual exposure rather than flooding, so that is my main reason for the uncertainty, as I feel that once I am back in my comfort zone, I will revert back and any perceived leap forward will just be fake.
One other thing, my CBT Therapist put forward the concept of visualisation, where you think about those things you can imagine yourself doing without needing to neutralise (in my case shower). So I am putting together a list, the thing is I can now visualise doing things I could not have visualised before so am hoping this visualisation will also stay when I go home.
Really appreciate any thoughts on this

"There's been lots of questions lately about Exposure and Response Prevention (ERP), including how long should an exposure take, what should you expect and how to go about doing it properly. There's also been some posts that have pointed to people only doing half of what a proper exposure should be. So here's a primer on ERP.
ERP is a type of CBT (Cognitive Behavioral Therapy) that encompasses both thinking in a new way and behaving in a new way. It is the central therapeutic method for effectively dealing with OCD.
Before one can understand how ERP works to battle OCD, it is a good idea to understand what is broken when it comes to OCD. With OCD, minor events and situations get blown out of proportion. Thoughts that should be sent to the brain's trash bin instead get rerouted to the part of the brain that reacts to danger. Warning bells go off and suddenly a thought becomes catastrophic. OCD'ers respond by performing compulsions, which only serve to cement in the mind that something was wrong with the thought -- that, in fact, the brain should be reacting strongly to the thoughts. This makes sure that the next time the thought comes up, it will sound the alarm bells even more loudly.
ERP works by changing the way a sufferer reacts to the intrusive thoughts. It is thought that new neural pathways can be created. We can learn how to not react so strongly to certain thoughts. This is done by controlling the one thing about OCD that we can control... compulsions. Every time a compulsion is performed, we reinforce the belief in our minds that there is something catastrophically wrong with the bad thoughts we get. This makes the situation worse. With ERP, we don't perform compulsions while still having the thoughts, thus teaching ourselves that we can have the thoughts without reacting so badly to them.
Is a spike the same as an exposure?
No. When you get spiked, or triggered, and end up having an intrusive thought, you are usually caught off guard and you end up responding usually the same old way, by performing compulsions. With ERP, you are prepared ahead of time for the thought to come and you are prepared to not perform compulsions. It is a planned thing. You are planning to make the thought happen and you are planning on not performing compulsions.
Set a goal
There are several things you need to do before starting ERP. The first is to set a goal for yourself. This is the overall thing you are going to work toward. For instance, if you have contamination problems, you might set a goal of washing your hands after using the washroom, before eating and when visibly dirty only.
Establish a baseline
The next thing to do is to establish a baseline anxiety level for yourself. People with anxiety disorders are usually pretty good at rating their anxiety, because they are used to feeling it in varying amounts. Think of a scale of 1 to 10, where 1 is totally and completely relaxed and 10 is a full blown panic attack. Now think about what your background anxiety level is, usually. This means, what is your anxiety level normally, when you aren't dealing with OCD intrusive thoughts and compulsions. This number, between 1 and 10, becomes your baseline. It will be used when you do the next step and when you actually perform ERP.
Let's just say, for this example, that you decide your baseline is 4.
Establish a hierarchy
The first step here is to write down a list of obsessions you have and/or things that trigger your OCD. Try to be as precise as you can. Don't write down something general like, I fear things I own are contaminated. Be more specific: 1) Dirt on bottom of shoe, 2) Touching a handrail, 3) Poop on bottom of shoe, 4) Dirt on pants, 5) Contaminated toothbrush.
Next, for each item on your list of obsessions, write down the compulsion you would normally perform. The list might look like:
Obsession Compulsion
1) Dirt on bottom of shoe Wash shoes
2) Touching a handrail Wash hands immediately
3) Poop on shoes Throw shoes out
4) Dirt on pants Wash pants immediately
5) Contaminated toothbrush Throw toothbrush out
The next step is to look at each item on your list and rate each item (on that same scale of 1 to 10) as to how much anxiety you feel it would cause you. Your list might look something like this:
Obsession Compulsion Rating
1) Dirt on bottom of shoe Wash shoes 4
2) Touching a handrail Wash hands immediately 5
3) Poop on bottom of shoe Throw shoes out 8
4) Dirt on pants Wash pants immediately 5
5) Contaminated toothbrush Throw toothbrush out 7
The last step is to rewrite your list from least anxiety provoking to most anxiety provoking. So the above list would look like:
Obsession Compulsion Rating
1) Dirt of bottom of shoe Wash shoes 4
2) Touching a handrail Wash hands immediately 5
3) Dirt on pants Throw shoes out 5
4) Contaminated toothbrush Wash pants immediately 7
5) Poop on bottom of shoe Throw toothbrush out 8
You now have a hierarchy of obsessions/triggers, from least anxiety provoking to most anxiety provoking. Now look at your list. Remember when you figured out what your background anxiety level is? If there are any items on you hierarchy that are at that level or lower, cross them off the list. There is no sense doing ERP on obsessions that don't raise your anxiety level. It won't work. Those items don't cause you much of a problem, so work on the higher numbers. We already determined (for this example) that the baseline level is 4, so 'Dirt on bottom of shoe' would be crossed off the list because it is also at an anxiety level of 4.
Understanding ERP
There are several parts to ERP. Some people think exposing themselves to an obsession/trigger is all that is needed. That is not true. All parts need to be completed in order to have a successful ERP session. They are:
1) Expose yourself to an obsession/trigger.
2) Purposefully do not perform compulsions for the duration of the exposure.
3) Allow your anxiety level to rise to its full height then wait for it to return to your baseline level.
One last step before ERP
Get prepared. A normal ERP session will typically take from 30 minutes to several hours. Set aside time for your ERP session when you will not be disturbed.
The session
You are now ready for your ERP session. The lowest item on our hierarchy list from above is ‘Touching a handrail’. The exposure part will involve touching a handrail. Better would be running your hand all over a handrail.
Think about what would normally happen if you touched a handrail. Would you run to wash your hands immediately? Well you’re not going to do that during your ERP session. You are going to purposefully not perform compulsions, like washing your hands.
Touch a handrail for a good length of time. Hopefully your anxiety level will rise to the level you wrote down when you rated that item on the anxiety scale (from 1 to 10). You actually want your anxiety level to rise.
Stop touching the handrail. Now, where you used to wash your hands, you will sit and wait. You will not perform compulsions. You will not wash your hands. You will not sit and ruminate about what could be on your hand. You sit and wait.
How long should you wait? Hopefully you can wait long enough that your anxiety level falls down on its own to your baseline level. With the handrail example, the baseline is 4. After touching the handrail your anxiety rises to a 5. You sit and wait for your anxiety level to fall down to a 4. At that point your exposure is over. You have succeeded!
What if my anxiety level doesn’t drop to the baseline?
If you’re dealing with an obsession/trigger that is not too far up the anxiety scale from your baseline, you can probably wait it out until your anxiety level goes back down to your baseline level. But what if it doesn’t? Does that mean you failed the exposure? Hardly.
Set a time limit for the exposure. Maybe at first you set the time limit to 30 minutes. Over time you extend the time limit by 15 minutes each time until you are waiting a couple of hours. Basically you are giving yourself more and more time to allow for your anxiety level to lower back down to your baseline level.
Repetition is the key
Exposures should be done multiple times. The ultimate goal is to get to a place where exposing yourself to an obsession/trigger doesn’t raise your anxiety level at all. This is where you want to be. To get there you need to repeat an exposure as many times as it takes to get to that place.
With our example above, you would do the handrail exposure repeatedly until you no longer get a rise out of your anxiety. Then it’s time to move on to the next highest item on your list.
Gain confidence
You are going to start exposing yourself to the lowest item on your hierarchy first. Then you move to the next lowest item and then the next lowest item. This is on purpose. You don’t start with the most anxiety provoking item because it would simply be too hard. You start on the lower items first, gaining practice and gaining confidence as you proceed higher up the list.
How often should I do exposures?
Exposures can be hard. You need time to recharge between exposures. You set the pace. The faster you do exposures, the faster you can conquer your obsessions. At the same time, do it too frequently and you will not have a big enough break in between. A good frequency would be one ERP session per day.
Watch out for compulsions
The whole point of exposing yourself to that which you fear/obsessions/triggers is that you won’t perform compulsions. You want to teach yourself that your anxiety level will return to normal without performing compulsions.
Watch out for ruminating. It’s the sneaky compulsion that can sneak on in and ruin a good exposure.",[],"['obsession', 'obsessions', 'intrusive thought', 'spike']","['obsessions', 'obsession', 'intrusive thought', 'spike']",1.0,,,,

"Hi y'all
With all this talk about exposure and rumination, well. It's making me want to admit a couple of things to myself; not a confession and not a plea for reassurance. I'd just like to talk about my worries because I'm feeling pretty stressed and have been for a while.
So first things first: the good news is that I am no longer praying for forgiveness every time I have a bad thought (yes, I'd fallen back into bad habits). I'm just letting them pass through me, because they're flotsam and jetsam.
As for why I'm so worried, well. This is the hard part. 
Six years ago I was just recovering from an OCD-induced depression after questioning something in my life that I liked doing and how it related to my religion. I'd got so used to worrying about it. Then I had a moment in my head of maybe making a promise that I would stop doing the thing I liked doing, based on something else that had got to me regarding my religious OCD that I knew was wrong and what's worse is that before that, I thought that it would be something to worry about. And I heard the words in my head but I don't know if I said them out loud or just thought them very clearly. 
Yeah, I know.
So. This is why I'm so haunted. I feel like I've committed an unforgivable sin against God and that the God I believe in doesn't love me anymore and doesn't want to know me. I feel I'm hearing all this stuff in my head, God telling me what to do and I feel it's wrecked me. One silly moment of madness and I feel it's made its own story, all because I like worrying so much. It's like an itch I can't scratch. I know that as we grow older we get more worries but I physically cannot stop worrying about this and I feel so alone and burdened with it all. But I was scared that if I spoke about it, it would make things worse; it was bad enough I was ruminating about it. I don't know what to do as I've had it on my mind for a long time and I'm used to worrying. I just don't feel I have the best on my OCD, essentially. Basically, I feel shame and depression over this one moment - and I know, I know we all make mistakes but I feel so guilty and wonder if come my death, I will be punished. I really don't want to trigger anyone else's OCD here but I'm so terrified my God no longer wants me. I feel like a bit of a loser; I can't seem to deal with my OCD anymore and I can't help but blame myself for it, because I feel I've locked myself into a corner I can't get out of and I'll never be free of this burden - I don't deserve to be better and I feel I ought to be punished. 
And I do not want reassurance or anything like that - I mean this as an exposure exercise, talking about my fears rather than bottling them up because I'm scared about what will happen if I talk about it. I just feel the anxiety from this has made me worse as a person and I'm terrified about my future, that I'll always be worrying because I just cannot shake this off - that I'll be an anxious partner, an anxious parent, that I may have anger issues, that I'll always get stressed too easily - and that makes me worry that it means something, that I have to do something for my God. My GP said I put far too much pressure on my shoulders but it's been tormenting me; I can't feel 100% normal and do the things I want to do because I feel I'm not allowed to do it, which makes me push forwards and try and prove I can do it, to spite my OCD - with disastrous results. Every time I try and do something, I remember this moment and wonder if it's OCD or God telling me not to do the thing and I have to stop myself ruminating to 'prove' that everything will be alright. 
I know this sounds mad and random; I just feel I can't bottle this up any longer and if I want to stop ruminating, I have to be honest with myself about why I'm so worried. I'm a bit of a mess, to be honest. I just needed a safe space to talk about it all. I hope you all understand. More than that, I hope the God I believe in understands.

"Hi guys,
Thank you for all your replies and support the past few days. I get so frustrated with myself when I ask for reassurance but it usually happens when I spike so suddenly and am convinced everything is real and it just overwhelms me. I'm sure you all know the feeling. Right now I am struggling to breathe, keep crying on and off and feel like passing out in general, but wanted to focus on some exposure techniques.
Basically, I am an impulsive person that has been known to do.....spontaneous, wild or silly things. (Mainly since my OCD became severe aged 18). I took a lot of drugs, let my friend shave half my hair off one night, spend all my money on random purchases. The first time I suddenly got a POCD spike I thought it was real an went into a cray hysterical state, got on a bus, travelled across the country and walked five miles outside a city I didn't know until the police were called and I got sunstroke. I don't even know why, I barely remember it, it was blury. I was just in so much pain and didn't know what to do, except get as far away from people as possible. It's often a self destructive thing when I am in the intermediate period between being well and really unwell. Combined with periods of being a thrill seeker, whcih can be a bad combination.
Anyway, I tell you this as an example of how I often go to extremes. When I had HOCD, which completely debilitated every aspect of my life, I didn't know I had OCD then and basically was convinced I was gay and couldnt accept it. It got to the point where I went to gay bars, came out as gay, made loads of new gay friends, and had a gay relationship. Seriously. It wasn't actually bad at all, I was mortified that I had wasted my life when there was nothing to fear. Also, with POCD fear of being a paedophile, you guessed it, I basically told myself I must have paedophilic tendencies to some degree. I accepted it, and the fear faded.
So now my fear, that has stuck, is the last taboo. I fear actually having done something paedophilic in nature. I know you dont have to go to those extremes to get over a fear, and the reason my OCD kept returning in different forms was because I didnt practice active, consistent exposure. It wasn't intentional exposure, I just got so distressed that I gave in and accepted as I thought I had no option. Obviously with this fear, I can't do anything radical to get over it in terms of announcing I have possibly sexually assaulted someone and then carrying on as normal. But I know how severe this can get, and I don't trust myself in a way not to confess to the police or something. It scares me how almost delusional it can get and how much I can sacrifice as a result. I do suffer from depression as well, but mainly as a side effect of OCD, although I did have brief depressive episodes when I was young. Sometimes I half wish this would slip over into full scale crazyness, because at least I wouldn't know I was nuts. I'd be so far gone I wouldnt care or know what was going on. Sad thing about OCD is that doesn't happen, we always have some link with reality which in a weird way makes it more painful.
Anyway, sory for rambling. I guess I wanted to vent. If you have any thoughts to share I'd be grateful.","['outside', 'stroke', 'depression', 'Thought', 'fear', 'OCD']",['spike'],"['outside', 'stroke', 'depression', 'fear', 'Thought', 'spike', 'OCD']",1.0,,,,
"Hi
I started CBT a couple of weeks ago and we got straight into exposure work. I have checking OCD and therefore any exposure work is based around that. The exposure work is going reasonably well and I am trying my best with it. I am a bit concerned that some of my other rituals are getting a lot worse (the ones I am not working on). Has anyone else had this? Is there anything I can do to stop this happening?

"Hiya,
Me again!
My OCD has gone seriously downhill I see no point in waking up anymore.
Over the last few weeks my OCD has got alot worse but within the last few days it has got beyond chronic.
I dread going to bed. It took me 4 hours 2 get in 2 bed last nite due 2 gettin stuck on my bathroom ritual. My partner was trying to help me but he gets very frustrated and angry with me he thinks i can control it but he is so wrong he has no idea what goes on in my mind despite many efforts 2 explain 2 him what will happen if i dont do my rituals. My bed time rituals r so bad i dont c a point in even tryin 2 get 2 bed anymore as it is more hassle than it is worth and gets me so distressed. Half of my stuff lives in the car so i cannot get caught up in rituals wiv it even half the linen cupboard is in the car and it has been known for a pot of gravy 2 b locked in my partners breifcase. All my underwear goes in his breifcase and toliet rolls live in the car boot.
I got no more than 4 half hours sleep last night. For weeks or even months i usually get no more than 5 hours sleep a night. I am tired exhausted sleep deperived so tired of OCD.
Need a rest need time out from it. I need 2 escape so badly but OCD just follows me. I cannot keep up wiv these exhaustin rituals at the same time survivin on barely no food (Anorexic)
This mornin it took me 3 hours 2 get dressed and 2 hours of that was spent doin my hair over 70 times. I felt hopeless and powerless.
Even goin out for a walk is not a time when i am away from OCD as i am then doin rituals in my head sayin things over and over again fightin intrusions and images out of my mind tryin 2 replace them wiv pleasent things.
Never do i sit down 4 1 min and b free from OCD. If i am not obsessin weather the back door is locked or if i have shut all the windows then i am obsessin weather i am dyin of sum illness or if i am not obsessin bout that then i am obsessin bout sczhiophrenic or what if i harm people or what if sum fink bad happens what if i am contaminated etc if its not that then i am pshycially doin rituals or repeatin things in my mind.
Never am i free not for 1 min.
OCD has got me badly and i really dont think i can cope wiv it anymore.
I do have help from a mental health team one of them is makin me worse but no 1 cares a **** so i am stuck wiv this guy. I am on medication but probably not enuf but i have a fear of drugs.
I have a fear of every fink.
Just have no life.

"So hi. 3 months ago me being AVOIDANT for many years escalated to social anxiety with an inability to look people in the eyes at all.At that time i had a mdma trip during which i convinced myself that i can look people in the yes just fine and for the following 2-3 weeks i had better than ever eye contact. But soon this faded out only to be replaced by excessive eye blinking in social situations, especially when making eye contact. (When i do make eye contact i try not to blink..but as soon eye contact is over i blink to death:P) I feel the fact that i pressured eye contact into happening before i was ready (i hadn't started cbt treatment at that time) was what led to the ocd blinking
Since then i began cbt treatment and i have made huge improvements concerning my social anxiety to the point where im much better than i've ever been....but the OCD eye blinking remains. Now i cant make good eye contact+ i keep blinking in social situations. I have understood that the solution to OCD is ACCEPTING it and some days are better than others but it wont go away. Can someone experienced please answer to this question:
Should i keep making eye contact even if this worsens the OCD blinking or should i drop eye contact all together in hope of the OCD blinking going away?

"Hi
I have been doing really well with my mental rituals lately and they are now virtually gone but I was on facebook again now and got the unwanted urge to look at a site that disagrees with something I like and the number of members is up from 99 to 102. This made me freeze. There is a category which the facebook group falls under which is Just For Fun, Totally Ramdom. But I am going away to London for a few days tomorrow and am worried that I will be thinking about the site and thinking """"""""What if it is right. What If!!"""""""" I dont want my trip spoilt.
It is a dislike to a certain type of clothing which is used as comfort wear for people, the grey tracksuit. A few weeks ago I researched and there were some very smart looking grey and other colour tracksuits which are used for comfort wear and stylish. But this site is mocking them by saying they are a """"""""crime against fashion"""""""" and the site leader is going round taking photos of people in them to later criticise them. How would you describe someone like that hey? The photos show wearers who look quite normal with a few in the baggier ones which are cheaper but the site is using that as an excuse to mock them. I see lots of people in them and most of them look very smart, casual and sporty and me and my mum sometimes wear them round the house, as do loads of others but this site is making me spike again.
I was told on here once that a lot of facebook groups are run by sad, narrow minded people.
Any thoughts?

"I've realised very recently that I've been hiding from my OCD - Quietly and subtly I seem to have managed myself and routines so very carefully to avoid triggers, and have so many rules and rituals to keep myself safe that on the whole I don't feel I'm struggling too much. So I have felt I was broadly 'over it' following a horrendous episode 10 years ago. But I was filling in a questionnaire this week and it asked me about my interests, and I couldn't think of any (because they've all been managed out) - additionally I've ended up having to accompany a group of people to London on Monday, and have spent weeks avoiding, blanking and resisting going, but now I have to, I've realised that this is a symptom of how far my avoidance and rules have gone - and reflected on all the things I have avoided doing so I didn't get anxious. I seem to have spiralled into a semi-existence devoid of anything except the game of staying safe and not triggering my OCD (which of course is a bit futile as I still ruminate and check things in my head all the time). Going to London is going to be a massive dose of exposure I expect and hopefully I can use it positively when I come back in one piece and reflect on it.

"So I know OCD can cause false attractions in people with HOCD or POCD. Can the same apply for people with OCD but not those themes?
anyone I find attractive I stress I might fancy. I am having this problem at the moment with a friend who I work with. I usually have a specific type, which is brunette. and there is a brunette woman at work who I have a massive crush on and I know it. There's no doubt. But with my friend, who is blonde, I keep worrying I might fancy her and I keep looking at her and trying to work it out. I've been doing this on and off for about a year. The idea of me fancying her worries me. But I just can't decide if I do or not. My friends say if I did I'd know. But at times it feels so real.
i should add I've done this kind of thing before with another blonde and ended up becoming obsessed with her. And it all came about because a friend made a comment that maybe I fancied her. And until then I'd given it no thought and had no feelings for her. After he said that I spent a few weeks continually looking at her and trying to test if I fancied her. But then I decided I did so does that mean it's not OCD?
im so confused all the time. I have the same problem with yet another friend but I see her less often. Occasionally I get it with a guy, even though I'm gay, but not often. I got married recently and even started to worry I fancy my brother as I saw him in photos and thought he looked nice.

"Firstly, I have just joined so hi to all the members on here.
I have had OCD since a child and, like everyone I suppose, I go through bad and good patches. My OCD has generally been quite manageable in recent years, but still displayed symptoms. Anyway one of my long term themes has been committing crimes, particularly those of a sexual nature.
As a university student I obviously go out drinking relatively often, until now. Unfortunately I have started getting more and more black outs and so have now decided that I am no longer going to drink in excess at all.
At the moment I am extremely anxious regarding a potential false memory of doing something terrible. One the night in question I went out with friends to a nightclub and, after drinking a lot, ended up walking home alone after they had already left and got cabs home. My memory had already started failing prior to walking home, and the last thing that I remember was starting the walk home. The next thing I remember is getting to my road and thinking that I had been walking for a very long time and was glad I was nearly home. At that point I was aware that I could not remember the walking home and may have been slightly worried about that. I don't remember getting home, nor what time it was, but I was supposedly annoyed that my housemates and girlfriend has left me. They say that I was very drunk, and moving like a 'rag-doll'.
In the following days I became very scared about the walk home and what I may have done. I also worried that I may have touched a girl I was talking to at the club. At this point I think I may have thought that I couldn't have done any thing because I would remember it. A, probable, false memory quickly evolved that I had touched the breast of the girl in the club, but I now think that I probably didn't.
I became less worried and functioned relatively normally in the following days. But have become more worried and have built up a full scenario of doing something terrible on my way home. Whilst I think it may have been built up over several days, at first I couldn't even decide whether the person that I could have hurt was blonde or brunette, it feels extremely real. In the last couple of weeks I have become completely convinced that it happened. I have suffered similar 'false memories' before but I feel like this one truly is real and I am convinced that it happened now.
It hasn't help that I have read things about people doing terrible things and becoming completely disinhibited through mixing SSRIs and alcohol. Could I become so disinhibited that I would commit my worst nightmare? I also found some semen stains on my boxer shorts and the smell of perfume on my jumper. These have further convinced me, although the perfume could be from my girlfriend or any one else. The boxers were, don't judge me, almost certainly already been worn, they were in a pile of clothes and I have realised that they had almost certainly already been warn. Thus the semen could have come from leakage after sex or masturbation before the night in question, which is probably likely. I should probably wash my clothes more often!
At the moment I am completely beside myself and I don't know how to even complete my exams and work. I have become convinced that I must have done something and that the thoughts that I have been debating over are not false memories this time but real. The only thing that is keeping me hopeful is that I have had false memories before that felt quite real and that I was probably too drunk to have been able to overpower someone or do something terrible. I had no injuries on me or any rips in my clothes, etc that would indicate that I had been in a struggle, etc.
Has anyone else completely believed their false memories, like almost 99% sure and then they turned out not to be the case?","['symptom', 'talking', 'hope', 'OCD', 'Thought']",['theme'],"['talking', 'OCD', 'Thought', 'symptom', 'theme', 'hope']",1.0,,,,
"Hey all,
Sorry for the absence of posting in the last week or so, I have been going through a particularly tough time of it, brought on by extreme exposure ( could be seen as flooding) and the psychological fall out from that.
I am hoping that I am finally seeing some clarity on the situation and feel strong enough to battle again after a great CBT session today.
What I wanted to share was something I wrote in my diary before I faced my exposures, when I was feeling particularly confident in my ability to fight the OCD. It was in the context of 'false memories' or things I am afraid of doing in the past.
I wrote:
'Just figured out the faulty logic of my OCD: If i cant remember it, then it must have happened""""""""
For anyone who suffers from this type of OCD, im sure these words will make sense to you, insofar as when we ruminate and try to remember everything, the very fact that we cannot remember the thing we are afraid of doing is almost used as proof to us that we did in fact do what we fear.
But if you read the sentence again you can see that it is completely bonkers and would not stand up to any other situation in life.
I dont know if people will relate to this, but I just wanted to share it, as I shared it with my Therapist today and she thought is was quite powerful and could be something to draw upon to combat ruminations.

What worries me is the memories of, groinal responce, images, fast heart, purposely putting my foot on her when we were either end of the sofa, and not moveing when her foot reached out, basically it feels like i was trying to initiate something. 
As aposed to false memory i dont know if ocd is tangling it up so that these things happened but its putting more meaning to it,
So lets say these things happened and i just became a sick drunken perverted basterd for a night, how do i deal with that, shouldnt i be taken away or something, because it realy feels like thats what i was, what sort of man could be like that, me it seems, i just dont get it. 
The memories genuinely feel that is the case, i cant eat and the stress is making me sick, trying so hard not to ruminate but because i cant put it down as false memories and because i acted on the thoughts by streching out my leg and my foot hit her bum, and the onslaught of thoughts. 
Just cant seem to understand how in anyway i can put this down to ocd, ive had real event ocd before but nothing as crazy as sort of trying it on with sister and actions.

The whole drug phobia started when i had my very first panic attack, i was out clubbing with friends, all of a sudden this felling took over, my ears and brain felt as if they were burning my heart was racing, i was shaking and felt """"""""half there"""""""" (the only way i can explain it, i was there but felt somehow like i wasn't??) anyway after the feeling stopped i had no idea what it was and could only assume that someone had spiked my drink.

"hey, how are you today? i was going to send a private message but i thought it would be better off on here! i havent been on here for a couple of weeks because to be honest i feel great, 100 times better than when we spoke last! i went to the doctors and he upped my dose of paroxetine and the gay thoughts are at a complete minimum, ive hardly even given them a thought! ive spent all weekend with all my male friends and not once did i get a spike....nothing! to be honest all weekend and for the last 2 weeks ive been completely obsessing over that girl im trying to get with, believe me you can get over this! we have spent the night together a few times lately, the sex has been great (although i still need viagra, and by that i mean more than one tablet) but im relaxed with her, and i loved every minute of it, so hopefully the viagra thing will stop as i feel a lot more at ease with her now! and you know what, i love her, i know i do, and shes told me the same! this is what i want, ive wanted her for years and im determined to make it work!
ill be honest with you, when i do get a gay thought, i check to see if i got a reaction """"""""down there"""""""" and yes sometimes i do, i do when i watched gay porn, i used to talk to gay people on the phone, internet, webcams and afterwards id hate myself! i knew i wasnt gay, it was something in my head what just made me do it! i cant undo the past, i regret it all! but as people have said to you, we both wouldnt be feeling like this at all if we were gay, because we would find it normal, and i certainly dont! as ive said before when my ocd hit the roof, i had thoughts of peadophilia aswell, incest, and we all i know thats not true!
dont let this beat you, ive fought it and im winning for once, only problem is i know when i do start seeing this girl full time, the guilt will force me to tell her EVERYTHING and that will be worse than anything, will she leave me?
but mate seriously as it stands, go to your GP, get some meds (i know they aint ideal but they have helped me no end), this can be beaten! im happy for once, im in love and im happy to shout about it!","['hope', 'regret', 'OCD', 'guilt', 'Thought']",['spike'],"['OCD', 'Thought', 'spike', 'regret', 'hope', 'guilt']",1.0,,,,

"Hello all.
  Recently (5 weeks) ago i became a father of a healthy beautiful son. Up until now things were quite ok, but i noticed that sometimes when he cries relentlessly i feel like im starting to get angry and frustrated. i try not to let it out, but it can be really hard sometimes.

Last night i slept with my son in the room separate from my wife. She was very tired and needed to catch up some sleep. But my son just would not go to sleep, he kept crying, spitting out his pacifier, overstretching etc etc. i checked everything, his diaper, clothing, fed him etc but nothing would help. 
  At some point i noticed i was starting to feel hopeless, frustrated and even angry!

So i began talking with a loud voice saying things like;


' I know your sad just stop it already! '
' Come on little one there is nothing to cry about! '

Or just making sounds like  ' arghhhhhh '


Of course i dont mean those things, but because of frustration it just happened. The thing is i also started to pick him up more roughly then usual. Like i lifted him up faster, i would lay him down a bit faster or harder. i even read online that shushing in the baby's ear quite loudly helps them calm down. Well i did that as well but did it like really loud! But nothing worked.

At some point i placed him back in his crib. made the bed went to lay down and he started again, i remember feeling this overwhelming sense of anger, and started to 'feel' the urge to do 'something' physical. but did not shake him or anything like that i just got this overwhelming feeling of wanting to do so, and thus made me handle him more roughly as i mentioned before. but while handling him i felt the urge to almost throw him across the room. (i am so embarrassed to tell this).

After this i layed him back in his crib and immediately felt huuuge guilt. Ever since i have been googling stuff like;

'' Shaken baby syndrome symptoms'' 
'' Angry fathers with baby's ''
'' Losing control with baby ''

and other stuff like that. Ive been searching the web for te past 7 hours relentlessly and it has only made my OCD worse and worse. I even posted this on Facebook into a facebook group and people are telling me i need to let the baby get checked by a doctor! this makes me even go into a bigger anxious state! thes people telling me i need to have him checked must mean that i have assaulted my baby somehow! Im a monster! i need to go to jail for this!

Right now i am constantly going over last night in my head over and over and over. trying to find evidence of me shaking the baby or anything like that. im so lost right now I feel like the worst dad alive! and that while i love my son soooo much!

Im at my work right now, but i cannot concentrate. all im doing is googling and stuff.

I also told my wife about what happened and she is questioning if it was ocd or not. As i understand she really is very protective of our son, and because i kept bringing this thing up the whole time she now thinks i might be hiding something or not telling something. This of course aggravates my OCD even more. i mean the thought that my wife is questioning it means i need to question it as well right? 

I understand why she is questioning me tho. I told her last night that we better call the doctor just incase 'something' did accidentally happen to our son. But to be honest the only reason i said i wanted to contact the doctor is because i need reassurance that i did not harm our child. But this of course my wife does not understand. (she really has a hard time understanding OCD in general). So everything  i question about myself most probably due to OCD she also a lot of the times starts to question me, because she does not recognize its my OCD talking which in return makes me question my OCD / self even more!

I could really need some help here ASAP! i feel like a terrible monster!


PS: This Wednesday i have my first appointment with my new psychologist. 

PSS: My ocd is also trying to recreate things i might have said to the baby, or the way i picked him up, held him, layed him down. Because i was so tired and half asleep its hard to remember everything, which is now also causing my OCD to spike really bad. What if during that 4 - 5 hr time frame i did something terrible but i cannot remember now because of sleep deprivation, etc???

"My OCD changes quite a lot and I worry about multiple themes at once, the reason I'm looking for advice is that I'm now 27 but when I was 21 my psychiatrist mentioned that I may have borderline personality but was not officially diagnosed, when I read his report I hadn't even heard of bpd? This shocked me at the time and ever since its always been in the back of my mind. Now I know the symptoms I'm always on alert and I look out to see if I'm acting like someone with bpd? I honestly get sooo scared I do get urges to flirt with other people but never do it, I've been with my partner for 10years and not cheated but have thought about cheating but not with intent nor do I wish to cheat, It scares me because I'm scared that people with bpd are dangerous? (This is probably not the case? Just my perception of what I've read)
Am I worrying over nothing? I do feel my emotions are up and down and iget unstoppable racing thought but I thought that was related to my OCD? My thoughts can be severe and time consuming and I do feel that I'm losing the happy loving me I just want to be me again:(

"I just came across this website and regsistered. I figured it might help to feel that I can talk about my unwanted feelings (and they ARE unwanted- i wish I didn't have them, but I can't help it. Plus I have to do routines, which make me feel reassured, although I hate the consequences and....
I won't go into too much extensive detail about my history, but I will say that I'm 17, in Year 12, and I've pretty much suffered from OCD since I was about 7 ? It really came to head when I was 9 and I felt physically worried about throwing up- I had physical symptoms which led me to believe that I was actually going to throw up. I never did, of course; in fact, I'm rarely ill *TOUCH WOOD*- that's the OCD talking bad joke. My anxiety stemmed from when I threw up in the middle of the night- I've gone through it with my therapists before, and I can determine that my feelings of acute anxiety; feeling out of control, because I had just woken up, thought nobody would realise (attention seeking-primarily, I have always sought reassurance about bodily ailments from my mum) Anyway, to cut a long story short, I've felt the need to do routines each night before I feel able to lie perfectly still in bed. I used to be terrified of throwing up, but I then I vomited twice and felt I """"""""could cope"""""""", though ofc nobody likes being sick. So I suppose this main anxiety has now shifted to being scared of having appendicitis (I hate writing the word, even!) My morbid fascination has led to me looking up the symptoms on the internet, firing questions at people who have suffered from it. My latest therapist even asked me if I wanted to see her scar...to which I hastily declined! On a day to day basis, I will often poke my body if I feel a """"""""stiffness"""""""" because I feel it is a pain, and then I will be in pain, and won't be able to control it. (That is my greatest fear), mainly on my right side, because that's where your appendix is. I occasionally make bruises, and hate them...I put cream on them to make them disappear quicker. I've also read stuff on self-harming, and talked to my therapist- I think this is a form of self-harming. Although I don't do it all the time- it's occasionally in intervals of the day when something triggers my anxiety, or just leading up to bed because that's when I feel the most anxious (I'm worried something will happen) At the moment, because I am so busy and independant (I like to go out with my friends and boyfriends like anybody else and I've just passed my driving test- HAPPY), I am only really having serious problems controlling my rotuines, rituals and anxieties at bedtime. I'm very tired, because I can't seem to get into bed without doing them. Or maybe I feel that I'm not trying. I'm in the midst of my AS LEVEL EXAMS (****) and my mum is getting annoyed. Her bedroom is udnerneath mine and she shouts """"""""Get back into bed! Go to sleep, please"""""""" when I'm trying to do them quietly(it's not intentional that she hears them), which is a little humiliating for an almost-18 year old. I want to go out in the evening without a) doing rotuines till 12/1 in the morning when I've come back late and b) her forbidding me from going out because I disturb the family, or bombarding me with texts saying """"""""get home"""""""" Unfortunately, I can't see my therapist till June (We live in the Channel Islands, and it's inconveninent and expensive to go to England regularly)which seems to give me some relief but I know that it all comes from me at the end of the day. I have to help myself. I'm not stupid, but I'm not depressed either. Life is generally good and I'm content with the way that it's going. I just want some support, help/suggestions..maybe motivation tips? I hate being bound by OCD. I know I think too much, but why do i have to pay this price? Plus it's so taboo to talk about to people who don't understand- I wish it had more awareness. People don't understand it. They're like' """"""""Oh yeah, I have OCD, I need to wash my hands all the time."""""""" Rubbish most of the time! People have no clue of the real symptoms, I believe. They seem proud that they have this """"""""problem"""""""" I feel it's embarrassing and debilihatating.

"I have a fear of using toxic household products such as bleach as I get scared that they'll get into my eyes. My mum made me clean the toilet with bleach. I didn't use gloves. I just took the cap off and poured some into the loo. I washed my hands after even though my hands didn't come into contact with the bleach I don't think. I don't think that the bleach got into my eye. I was wearing my glasses. My eyes felt a bit sore and dry. I worried what if I really got bleach into my eye.
My mum said that if I got bleach into my eye that I'd be in a lot of pain and I'd be sensitive to light and wouldn't be able to see. I keep testing my eyes to see if I can see properly. My eyes don't hurt but they feel dry and a bit sore, maybe because I feel a bit ill and my eyes are always sore and dry when I'm unwell. I don't know if I'm only noticing it more now. My eyes were really sore yesterday as well. My eyes look ok and aren't red. They are a bit itchy though. I touched them after washing my hands after using the bleach though I don't think that I got any on my hands. I just removed and put the cap back on. I'm just scared that bleach got into my eyes and don't know it.

"Hi all,
Just wanted to get this one off my chest. I haven't had this particular spike for nearly a year (since I've been on clomipramine). Instead of this, I've been consumed by contamination fear which of late, I seem to have controlled but now this horrible harm ocd fear has resurfaced
As a result, I havent spoken to my therapist about this spike as it hasnt been troubling me. My big fear (I live with my mum and dad) is that I would harm them with knives/tools etc. I recognise it is one of my biggest fears, but the thing that's scaring me is I'm thinking, not """"""""what if I go mad and do something"""""""" but """"""""Do I want to do something?"""""""" Im kind of looking to judge my feelings to prove that I'm repulsed by it and then get scared if I think i'm liking it a bit - does that make sense?

"I am desperatley trying to find someone else with my symptoms. I am to begin CBT, but still am unsure if this really is OCD. I do not know if I'm actually ill or just reacting normally.
The thought of someone having a bad opinion of me is terrifying and debilitating. I try never to say anything bad about anyone, even if they are in another country and know none of my friends. I always worry that my innocent comments about someone to a friend etc. might get changed around and get to that person sounding completely different.
I have big urges to chase the person down (about who the comment was made), and explain to them what I meant, in case they got the wrong impression. Often I spend some of my day working out and executing how to get in touch with someone to tell them what I meant by what I said, and not the false version I fear they will hear. Once I've spoken to the person I feel relief, but this only lasts until the next episode.
I am also very scared of intimidation. I try to never offend anyone or have arguments. I worry that if I upset someone, and people came round my house intimidating me, I would turn into a quivering shaking mess.
I do have rituals of checking locks, cooker off, switches off before I go to sleep, or going out.
Has anyone else had these symptoms, or heard of this??

"Hi,
New here, just wanted to find out if anyone else is dealing with the same as me or similar.  I get the intense fear of slipping into a delusion or I will hear an external voice in my head any moment, that brings lots of anxiety. It will get triggered if I think I see a shadow out the corner of my eye, or a flash or something weird in my vision. Also if I can make a face out of inanimate objects, whilst looking at a tree or bush or something silly like that. It can even be triggered if my inner monologue is chatty & I start to think what if I dissociate it one day as my own voice. So my ocd basically themes itself round losing control of my mind, not having a grip on reality. Or devolving schizophrenia. 
  I would like to make very clear that I don’t have anything against people that do have schizophrenia or psychosis. Or that it should even be feared in any way.

"Hi,
I haven't posted here in a while, as I've been doing much better, but since my relationship ended a couple of months ago some thoughts have been starting to creep in again - not enough to bother me that much, but I am getting anxious about the future for several reasons, and worrying a bit about what I may have done in the past too.
I was incredibly anxious about my OCD when I got into a relationship with a great, understanding guy a year ago, and he helped me through a lot of my fears (which were mainly about being attracted to children, hence I guess feeling attracted to him may have felt like a """"""""safety blanket"""""""" guarding against those fears). However, looking back now I'm not sure I was in the best place to enter into a relationship and I'm starting to worry about whether I only went into the relationship because it was a comfort against my fears, even though I know that this probably isn't true. That possibility makes me feel like a bad person, because although my boyfriend helped me a lot, I know that I made his life more difficult and our relationship was by no means easy as I developed ROCD a few months in. I had CBT earlier this year, which really helped with that at the time.
Since we broke up and I don't have that daily confirmation that I am indeed attracted to men, I've started to worry again about, firstly, being attracted to children (to a lesser degree) and an old theme of mine, being attracted to women instead (to a greater degree). At the moment I've begun to notice myself analysing people I see in the street (men and women), and imagining scenarios with them and how I would feel in those scenarios, trying to analyse what I feel or think about them and whether I am or potentially could be attracted to them - it almost feels like I don't know what I """"""""truly"""""""" think any more because I overanalyse everything. I am most scared that I just will never be attracted enough to anyone and that I am too much of a perfectionist to ever be """"""""happy enough"""""""" with anyone, as well as being afraid that no matter how amazing someone is, my thoughts will always get the better of me and I will still begin to question whether we are """"""""right"""""""" for each other. I know, thinking logically, that if I enter into a new relationship and it does come to that, I can use my techniques learnt in CBT, or if it gets worse I can go for CBT again, but the """"""""what if"""""""" thoughts are starting to make me feel anxious again. I am also guilty of looking at other people's relationships and wondering if I'll ever have something """"""""like that"""""""", then worrying about it.
I'm wondering if anyone had any similar experiences or could suggest anything that may help - sorry this was long!

She knows I suffer from OCD as all my family know. Anyway I told her I have a fear of when I'm staying with the Kids I will stab them in my sleep. Obviously she is extremely concerned and needs to know if there is any chance whatsoever of this happening. This is the very worst thing I could think of when I'm down there and for some reason that's why it pops into my head when I go to sleep, causing me to perform rituals.
Since this all came up my anxiety about it has increased so now the next time I go down its going to be even worse. The advice says horrible thoughts are normal and are never acted upon but she needs more reassurance, as I have explained the fear is when I am asleep and have no control over it.

I am constantly arranging my life around things I must do in order to keep other people happy. and it never seems to get reciprocated. For example I never ever go out on a Sunday because I know my parents are expecting me round and expecting me and my partner to do odd jobs when we are round there so I just can't plan anything on a Sunday. Yet last Sunday I turned up and they weren't there. I phoned them to check where they were (I have a key so I can let myself in and wait) yet when I phoned them I got """"""""we're at so and so's, don't knwo how long we'll be"""""""" in a really snappy tone, yet one sunday in 3 years I didn't go round and I got a phone call asking why not and all the old """"""""I'll remember this next time you want something"""""""". It's really getting to me now and I don't know how much more I can take.","['anxiety', 'anxiety', 'OCD']",['spike'],"['spike', 'anxiety', 'OCD']",1.0,,,,
"hi guys.. im so fed up.. my main ocd theme is surrounding my gf and whether i love her.. even though i know i do!! which pises me off more but its been constant for the last 8 weeks. it has briefly changed.. a few times i have obsessed about being gay which used to be a massive theme when i was younger.. and just today i was worrying what if i had feeling for my ex girlfriend who i didn't want to be with and who i haven't seen or spoke to for over 3 and a half years.. it just popped up because a friend mentioned her...
then tonight my parents came down and we went for a meal and for a brief 5 minutes i worried what if i had feelings for my mum in a sexual way which is just stupid.. that passed rapidly... but i know at the time they were repeating just as much as my main worry about my girlfriend but this one just wont shift like the others... its stupid.. their is no reason for it.. we get on perfectly. we have been together 2 and a half years.... she is perfect for me.. we spent ten months apart in different countries and both stayed loyal as she ws studying in japan. this literally popped up one night out of nowhere and that just doesnt happen in relationships grrr! the main issue it focuses on is do i find her attractive enough... and the annoying thing is she is probably out of my league looks wise... but i literally cant walk down the street without seeing a good looking girl and feeling terrible and in my head that means i dont love my girlfriend... i even feel like if i look at a celebrity like rihanna and find her sexy it means i dont love my girlfriend whic is just blood ridiculous.. every time i see a girl now i will look and if i dont find them attractive im happy.. but then if they are good looking i feel so bad..... i dont even watch porn which most men do and i havent for the majority of our relationship as i feel bad for doing itt...... its just their constantly on repeat in my head.. if she doesnt have her make up done now it will be a big thing in my head were before this kicked off i never even thought twice about it.... i remember when it changed one day to if i had cheated on her on a false memory i made up over two years ago the other day,... i thouht she looked beautiful as i wasnt focusin on my main worry.. then the same day when it changed back and she looked no different i was worrying about her looks again
Just what the hell am i meant to do!!!! when is this ever going to bloody end without ruining everything.... its just not normal for this to happen... yet objectively its so obvious its ocd but i cant just accept that and even if i can it doesnt make me feel better.. i dont like keeping anything from my girlfriend but i cant ell her this stuff as it would break her heart....... i just need some advice as its killing me. and i cant cope i just want it to stop","['Thought', 'object', 'OCD']",['theme'],"['Thought', 'theme', 'OCD', 'object']",1.0,,,,
"My theme at the moment is overthinking everything and not understanding anything! It's so draining and confusing. Has anyone had this theme or do you think something else is going on here?
  i also change my mind from one moment to the next. My boyfriend and mum dislike eachother and some moments I agree with my boyfriend and then the next I am angry with him and feel bad for my mum. 
  I also get stuck on silly things such as my boyfriend used to like pictures of trashy girls and he's always told me he isn't like that - so I get confused and think maybe he just liked them in the heat of the moment but wouldn't want them as a girlfriend. But I feel like this hasn't clicked or reassured me. And the more I obsess, the more confused I feel. 
  I also watched a programme on pedophiles and I thought to myself, I understand they did it because it's taboo and excited them - I always try to understand why people do things and now I'm worried that makes me a pervert. Even though I never have perverted thoughts when I'm not in this mood. I think I had a fantasy thought once that I made love with my son (I don't have kids btw and my son was actually my boyfriend but younger in this thought)   and now I think that makes me so weird but I know I would never do that in real life. And I get stuck thinking how can I understand it if I think it's wrong. 
Its like my mind never lets me think my own opinions, I'm constantly unsure. My boyfriend has never had anxiety and he talks so much sense and knows his own mind completely and I envy that so much. His able to be rational and tries to give me advise such as just squash the thoughts straight away and I know it all makes total sense but makes me more anxious because I wish I could do that but when I'm feeling like this it seems near on impossible. 
Sorry for the long rant. Sometimes I feel like all I do is obsess and get stuck on things and it's no quality of life. I never want to harm myself but I kind of feel like I don't care what happens to me or think of the future because of this. I want more than anything to be better. When I get so anxious it's like a massive insecurity attack and I think all bad thoughts like my boyfriend is cheating, doesn't want me, is going to go off me. I'm not normal etc. I know these thoughts don't help but once I'm in that mood I can't snap out of it. 
Ive noticed my anxiety is worse when I am in a relationship. I think partly because I think it's off putting and worry they will find out and go off me. He also wants to make plans like to move out and have kids and my anxiety tells me I can't do any of this. That if I fell pregnant I wouldn't be able to cope etc. I'm mentally drained. And when I obsess it's like I'm trying to get the right thought so I think so hard and repeat it over and over and sometimes it makes my mind feel so stuck and confused it's hard for me to even keep my eyes open because of the heaviness of the thoughts / tense feeling in my brain. 
  Can anyone relate? Do you think this could be something worse than OCD? I used to have all the normal touching and washing hands etc but I got over that once I understood it's OCD but bevause no one else seems to relate to this I just carry on ruminating and I'm wasting my life  being stuck in my head

I've come a long way as I used to throw all items of clothing away if I though semen had got on them. Now my main issue is (excuse the detail) about old dry semen. I sometimes keep a cloth to wipe up excess semen after sex and it can get a bit crusty and smelly, but I though that It came into contact with my phone or shoes and panicked. So instead of panicking about this I decided to do my own form of exposure therapy by touching the cloth then touching my phone or other personal items that I didn't wish to get contaminated.

Does anyone else feel they just ahve no choice but to ruminate and let there mind go round in circles. When a trigger comes up for me mental rumination is such a knee jerk reaction. As sooon as i get the intrusive thought there i am starting the rumination ratehr than just accepting the randomness of my mind. It very hard , draining, exhausting and is beating the cr*p out of me these last few days. I feel like giving up on trying to beat it but i have the most wonderful therapist who i now feel like im letting down a bit as im struggling with NOT seeking reassurance in any form and even when i do it does not lower my anxiety..

"This morning is not going well.  Feeling very anxious. Everything feels contaminated and I don't know what to do. About 3 and a half weeks ago I was helping out at an event where children were playing on the floor.  Later, one of them showed me he had cut his finger before arriving at the event and there was dried blood around the cut. This meant that some of his blood was likely to be on the floor. I have avoided going back into this room but, of course, others were walking all around and then walking into other areas of the building, spreading the blood into other rooms, which I have then had to walk into. The floor of the  original room has been cleaned now, but there was plenty of opportunity for the blood to spread before this happened. I now feel that I have brought the blood into my own house and that of the family etc I have visited - I take my shoes off as soon as I enter houses, but others step on the hallways, doormat etc that I have trodden on in my shoes and then walk into the houses. My daughter and nephew also play on the floor and then touch things around the house, so everything feels contagious. I'm trying so hard not to tell my daughter to keep washing her hands and to keep away from the floor but it feels so wrong not to protect her.

"Hello reader,
I recently had a bad OCD spell and I've started to find relief and feel better. The thing is that I feel a bit of a hollow feeling and don't feel like much that I say or do has much meaning or emotion.
Perhaps I worry that what I say or do is just to justify and disprove my previous OCD experience, so it doesn't feel genuine.
The situation is that I flew into town to visit my family and all was going well and I was having the best time ever, but then I had a bad OCD episode, so now I just want to say and do what I feel still, but can't get that darn puzzling situation out of the back of my mind.
It seems like I'm some sort of overall life-experience perfectionist... For example if I go on a vacation for 6 days and the first 3 are good and full of peace of mind, then I have a spike on the fourth day...I consider it a bad vacation because I will be afraid that I will only remember the vacation by that OCD incident or a certain thought.

"Hi
I've tried to stay away from the forums for a few days as have been having a few ups and downs.
Went to therapy and have been given ERP homework, a recording of myself speaking the 'worst case scenario' of what might have happened on this night I am worried about. But I listen to it and the words don't make me anxious, it's like listening to a story. I've also been given a recontamination phrase to use when I start mental rituals. But I'm saying this thing and I'm feeling relief from it almost as I finally have an answer rather than feeling anxious. 
I have almost reached a conclusion that I've done these things because everything in my mind points to the fact that I have. The one thing that told me it hadn't happened and now I'm convinced that I made it up and lied to everyone.
I'm trying to stick with the therapy but it feels like it's a waste of time, how can you therapise someone who doesn't have a disorder to treat? 
I suspect that I'm on the verge of a breakdown. I almost walked out of work today and my first thought was just ending my life. It doesn't even upset me to say it anymore, the idea feels like release. I'm sick of the thoughts day in day out. I'm sick of the battle. I'm sick of not knowing. I'm sick of trying to work out if I've always known. I don't want this to be the norm and if this passes, what will it be next?

"Hi,
I haven't been around on the boards for quite a long time now. I have been extremely busy trying to get my OCD under control.
I have suffered with OCD for the last seven years....mainly comtamination OCD, and through the help of medication and CBT I feel I have come an awful long way. This time last year I was at my worst, unable to leave the house for days on end, forever cleaning, and 'uncontaminating' myself time and time again. Life was truely a living nightmare. Over the last year, my life has become amazing. I have gone from washing my hands over 100 times a day to washing them maybe once or twice (other than for the normal things, like after going to the toilet, changing my sons nappy etc...). I can happily leave the house for hours on end wandering around town and not worry that I am being contaminated. The list is really endless of what I have overcome, the best way I can describe it, is, this time last year I was getting through a tube of handcream every other day due to how sore my hands were. This winter, I have not applied handcream once, as my hands are smooth and soft naturally!!! I will never say I am OCD free as I still get the thoughts, but am able to just shrug them off and not think about them, or place any importance on them.
However, this is my problem and my worry. Something happened today while I was out wandering with my son, and I got one of my OCD thoughts. For the last 6 months, I have been able to just shrug them off, but today, I can't get this thought out of my head. I keep thinking over and over again about what happened. I'm starting to get the dreaded contamination feeling that I haven't had for months. It just keeps playing on my mind.
I am deliberately not writing down what happened, as I am not looking for any reassurance, I haven't asked for any in over 6 months, and I am determined not to ask for it now. I have also not completed any rituals associated with 'decontaminating', I am just really thrown by the fact I can't get rid of the thought.
Is this a normal thing to happen to someone that has been getting on with a normal life for the last 6 months? I know things in my house are a bit stressful at the moment, but things have been more stressful over recent times and I have coped fine.

I have been trying to lead normal life, and wasn't doing too badly for a week or two. But, lately I feel so low and guilty and I just don't want to live like this anymore. For those who know me, you will be well aware of my ruminations. For those who don't, it's to do with my dog who passed away a few years ago, she was a yorkshire terrier and she was 17 years old. I smacked her when I was a child/teen when she was considered to have done something wrong- like going out into the back garden snd barking at passers by. I feel so guilty about this and the fact that she didn't have regular walks. I think because she was so submissive (whenever you called her name her ears went down and she would look away and put her head down, she wouldn't maintain eye contact with you- always averting her gaze). She liked to go out and bark, she did this several times a day, therefore I might have gone out and smacked her for this 'wrong' doing several times a day. With her being a small dog I might have smacked her too hard too.
I feel I dont want to carry on, nothing helps me. CBT didn't help at all. I'm at work and haven't been able to do anything yet- I have been searching on the internet looking for evidence that a significant proportion of dogs were very submissive like her (I haven't seen many dogs at all out and about that were as submissive as her) but I am not convinced.

"Hi guys,
Last night I did a major exposure, something I've been considering for a while. I've done a decent amount of exposure in the past 6 months and I'm functioning generally fine day-to-day but this was the one thing I was still very unwilling to do.
I went to bed and left sharp objects (nothing major, just a a cutlery knife and fork) in my room the whole night. Given my harm-ocd fears and how my anxiety gets much worse at bed time this is a huge deal for me. I was able to do the whole exposure and sleep without removing the cutlery from my room, clearing them up along with my glasses plates and taking them downstairs the next morning... But I felt awful the whole time! I didn't feel my anxiety decrease like my other exposures I've done, it just waxed and waned but wouldn't subside . I was so freaked out that I had nightmares (the nightmare themes weren't related to my OCD themes, but they were probably set off by the anxiety).
I know I should be proud but I just feel tired, irritable and miserable now since my anxiety didn't decrease. For the umpteenth time I feel like I'm taking steps back rather than forward. How am I supposed to cope when I'm done with CBT if I can't even manage this?

"Hey guys,
Feeling really awful these last few days, i have been doing so well at CBT with my checking behaviors, i have been learning to trust myself that i have locked the door, and that the violent thoughts are just thoughts. But now the OCD has a different theme.
I went out on Saturday for a friends leaving do, me and my girlfriend went along, we all ended up in some bar that was a bit cheap and tacky. after our first drink two girls who were obviously employed by the bar started dancing on a table in the window to get lads into the bar as it was quite quiet.
These girls were wearing next to nothing, and of course all my friends were staring, in my drunken state i tried not to look but found myself having a glimpse now and again. My girlfriend was upset and she fell out with me, as i was drunk i shouted at her as we argued. The morning after i felt absolutely awful, i apologised over and over and we made up, but she is really insecure now understandably so. I would never cheat on her as i love her so much.
Anyways i started obsessing over the incident and getting depressed again, going over the past and analysing everything ive ever done wrong in our relationship.
Then i remembered a conversation i had with a friend before i went on a first date with my now girlfriend. It went along the lines of my friend asking me 'is she fit', i replied something like 'no shes just normal, but really nice and really sexy' i cant remember the exact conversation, but i feel guilty because it was before our first date and i shouldlnt have been so shallow.
I absolutely adore my girlfriend, weve been together two years this week, i can honestly say she is the most beautiful, amazing, caring, loving and sexy girl and i love her so much it hurts.
Knowing that i have upset her by looking at those girls makes me feel so shallow and worthless, i just feel like she would be better off without me and she deserves someone who wont upset her. But losing her would be the worst thing to happen to me, she has changed me into a nicer caring person, being with her makes me so happy. I just feel so bad for what i said to my friend before we got together, i had only seen her in work clothes and i shouldnt have been so judgmental and shallow.

"I feel like I'm at an all time low as far as OCD goes.
I've had contamination OCD for just over 10 years now.
About two and a half years ago I had been out of gainful employment for some time, trying to change careers after a layoff the year before. It failed miserably and I had to get back into IT work to keep my apartment/condo. Yes, the same place that has dog poop in the hallways... But I digress.
My first job back in IT was full of triggers: gasoline stored in the warehouse, field techs putting on insect repellent in the office, dogs coming in with their owners, my cubicle by the toilets where I heard everything including the lack of handwashing (surprising to me), and a few people with other personal hygiene habits that caused me concern.
I would wash my hand a lot there. There were jokes made at my expense about the soap bubbles left behind. I ended up leaving for various reasons and have a new job that is leaps and bounds better in all respects. For that I am grateful.
But while I had that previous job I had to go home one day to find some information. I normally would have had a shower before touching things in my home. I had to go through things that are important to me, of sentimental value, to find this card I needed. I'm having a very difficult time as I feel, even though I washed my hands, everything I touched when I went home is contaminated with these things from that old workplace whether from the sleeves of my shirt or not washing my hands well enough. It has been two years since I had to dig through those boxes and I haven't been able to touch them since.
I don't know what to do. If they had no sentimental value, I would just pitch them. But these things, while not a lot in quantity, are momentos of my childhood (birthday cards from my deceased grandparents, Granda's watch, one teddy bear, a few books, etc.) that I pared down to a few boxes when my marriage ended and I wound up single with my daughter in my little apartment. I just want things to be okay but I've struggled for the last two years to feel anything that resembles okay.
I feel so discouraged to the point that everything I touched or bought during the period that I worked at that place is contaminated and, even worse, contaminating everything else in the process.
I feel so irresponsible for taking this """"""""step forward"""""""" of not showering before I went through these things. I feel irresponsible for taking this job in the first place but I was at risk of losing my home. In reality, it feels like a thousand steps backward. I know, I've had some accomplishments in the summer with exposures, but they feel all for naught.
I feel very, very stuck and terrified of doing anything to """"""""fix"""""""" it for fear of making it worse. As it is, I feel like the foolish optimism I felt at the time to get on with life while I had this job was fooling myself into """"""""flooding"""""""" and I haven't been able to shake it in spite of being at a new job for a year and a half.
Sorry for the long post.

"Some things I've learned from my therapist and in my experience with this crazy little thing called OCD:
- Feel the fear and do it anyway. Make your life based on choices independent of how you feel. Don't wait until you feel """"""""better""""""""
- Your feelings are broken and will continually attempt to deceive you. Just because you feel something doesn't make it real
- Give up. Not on life but on your grip on trying to avoid spikes. You will always want to find an excuse why just one more ritual is needed. Give up now and save yourself the trouble of realising it later on
- Spiking more and feeling worse aren't signs that you're """"""""doing it wrong"""""""". The more scary spikes the better
- There is no solution to be reached by analysing a spike
- Accept that maybe everything you're doing is wrong

"Hello,
I came off medication 3 months ago. I received ocd-CBT therapy for almost three years.
I do not think I feel bad. Most people here are in much more difficult situation than me.
I just feel so exhausted sometimes. Most of the time I just do not feel very good.
When ocd thoughts come, I do not have panic attacks any longer, I can recognize them, but they still make me feel uneasy and nervous.
I am sometimes not sure if this is OCD thought or just excessive thinking, but I have the same approach: not to fight the thoughts, but not take them at face value, since they do not really matter. Nevertheless, they still bothering me.
It is possible to learn to fight ocd to the extent, that I can really feel good in normal life?
:flowers:
Or should I accept the fact, that I will be always feeling quite nervous, stressed and sometimes exhausted because I have ocd?

"Hi all
Going away on holiday with my dad and brother over the next few days, so just though I'd post ahead.
I'm doing okay, but feeling a little unwell. I'm coping better and easier at work without the flood of thoughts and feel I have more control.
But I still feel very, very sad. I feel in some ways, as though I have a 'crack' right across my brain that's hurting me; I feel my whole head is hurting me and I hurt on the inside. I know the answer might be to have some more tablets, but I can't. I can't do that again; I want to deal with it on my own. I know there's nothing wrong with it, but the Prozac did, I feel, take away my creativity to some degree.
I feel very sad from the inside out and I don't want to ruin the holiday for my dad and brother. I hope to be able to chat to them both. I feel I've done this to myself, but I realise our thoughts are thoughts. I've been crying a lot; I cried this morning getting ready for work and I had a wobble today. I was very, very frightened that I was going to do something bad and harmful. I don't want to do that.
Part of my worry is losing my conscience; to some degree, I feel my OCD forms part of my conscience and I don't want to not be aware of harmful things. I don't want to be an unkind person, but I don't feel very kind at the moment as I keep having horrid, unkind thoughts about others and wish i could just bury myself somewhere until I feel alright again. I wish my Mum was here. I know I can talk to my Dad and brother, but I just feel so sore and wish the feeling would go away. I feel pained and sick and anxious easily. I don't want to let anyone down, but I'm scared I'll always be a worrier and I'll never be able to let go. I feel very alone and isolated; like I have my knees up and the world is moving around me. I don't know how to make myself feel better and am struggling to socialise; I feel as though I have to 'come up' from my head to get to where I need to be.
I just feel very, very afraid. I feel I'm adrift, with nothing to ground me and I want to find safe space. I've found distraction is more helpful than anything (oh gee, you think??? ) but my mood can fluctuate, minute by minute; one minute I'm fine and the next I'm going downhill. I just don't know if I can trust anyone enough to open up, but I feel in desperate need of a friend. I just want to feel safe and secure inside myself; I want to know for certain that I'm not going to hurt anyone, that I'm not going to get overwhelmed and that things will eventually be okay. I feel ashamed from the inside out and feel I hurt so much. I've felt like a failure for a long time and I hate feeling like that, but I can't describe how alone and isolated I feel. I don't even feel close to God and that makes it even worse. I know I've been told to focus on recovery, but I want to maintain my Christian beliefs. Maybe part of the problem is that I'm not doing what I'm supposed to do; maybe there's something I'm not doing that I need? I just can't enjoy the world and anything in it; it feels like it's hit a dead end and sometimes I feel I don't want to be part of it and where it's headed; I don't think I could enjoy continuing to live in this environment. I don't think I'm a very good friend or would make a good girlfriend or wife, and it makes me feel lonelier than ever. I know I'm not alone, but I feel I'm inflicting myself too much on others, me and my problems, when they have problems of their own. I feel so empty all the time and though I find some joy with my writing, I just don't know if I'll ever be full again and if I am already slowly dying to a bad life. I've felt empty and sad for a long, long time and wonder if I'm living some factors of my life wrong and don't know how to approach the subject without getting caught in a constant cycle of rumination and overthinking.
Things just feel different to the way they did years ago when I was okay. I know it's silly and childish, but I feel I want to go home until the bad has passed. I miss my Mum and just want to be at home where it's safe with my Dad. I didn't want to leave my dad last time. I just hope and pray for understanding and compassion from God and that everything I do is enough and that i can show understanding and compassion to others in turn. I just feel like I want to throw a blanket over me until everything outside is less scary. I feel trapped and unhappy and I can't stop crying and feel ridiculous that I've let my OCD get on top of me, that I've let it get this far. I'm a worrier by nature, but I'm scared I'm enjoying it; that I do these things to myself to worry and to give myself something to mull over. I wish I wasn't like that and I could do better with myself. I've spent years mulling over thoughts and I wonder if it was just for the sake of rumination. Maybe that makes me a stupid and bad person and so maybe I am just a bad Christian for not doing better. I can't let go and I wonder if there's a reason for that.
I'm sorry to sound so down and awful; I don't know exactly how to let this bad out of my system and how to feel free and relieved. I'm scared about talking about it, in case something bad happens. I just can't trust myself, or trust that I deserve good things and to be happy.

If he touched fluids and they were on his hands before our encounter maybe im now infected. Obviously i know its highly unlikely but i cant stop thinking about it. Feeling pretty crappy.

"These past few days have been really horrible. I'm not going to repeat the story as I posted before. See previous post. 
I feel so sick and disgusting. I feel so depressed and I can't think of anything else. I feel like I've committed a crime. I can't stop going over what happened in my mind. 
I obsessively keep thinking and trying to remember what happened but I can't remember clearly what I was thinking. I keep trying to replay the moment the little girl sat on me and rubbed against me. Was I mentally testing that it was a woman rubbing against me, was I imaging she was a woman? I wasn't turned on and this had nothing to do with the child. I wasn't aroused and have no sexual interest in children. What bothers me is that I associated with the girl rubbing on me (the girl was playing and climbed on me and was playing a bit vigorously) with a woman rubbing on me and ruminating about it with a child on me. That makes me sick. I don't think I felt comfortable with the child on me. I feel like I shouldn't have had those thoughts and rumination with a child on me. I feel sick that I kept replaying the scene with the little girl on me in order to gauge what was going through my mind and what it was about it that made me associate it with with a sex act. Did i imagine the little girl was a woman rubbing me? I cant remember. I was not turned on by the child rubbing on me and feel disgusted that I associated it with a lesbian sex act and that I ruminated in my mind with the child still on me, whether I would want to have a woman rubbing on me.

"Hi everyone
I haven't really been around a lot this last week - not sure if that's a good sign.
I wanted to write in because I've felt a lot better, for the first time in two and a half years, and haven't been putting pressure on myself. I don't know what happened - if it was a mixture of admitting to myself what was going on, putting the mindfulness into practice (and also reading another book, Manage Your Mind) and something suddenly 'clicking' into place. I haven't ruminated for a week; for the first time in a very, very long time, I haven't been stuck in a pure O cycle. I took a list of all the anxiety symptoms I was suffering from, reconnected with my beliefs - felt like I was running from them because I was so scared - and it seemed to click in I was holding on way too tight and resisted the rumination: I thought about other things instead. I also made a point of not doing what my OCD had got me into the habit of doing - before I had been trying to make myself do things to try and prove a point; 'if I can think like this and mean it, everything will be alright.' So I began distracting myself, began doing other things, threw myself into finishing the course; just a couple of assignments to do now.
And I don't know. It feels like everything has changed overnight, somehow; I woke up one day this previous week and it felt like something had clicked. I didn't have to govern myself. It was as if my mind had gone into overdrive and then we'd just got to 'right, no more of this' state. Now I feel my mind is freer; I had been feeling trapped, exhausted and desperate and was losing sleep. I don't know if what I feel is relief, but it is something better. I feel less trapped, hemmed in and closer to God. I feel as though I needed to turn around and not be afraid to reconnect with my beliefs, because I don't want to give up on them. It feels as though I've accomplished something; faced something I was scared of.
I do feel awful, though. I wish the common sense had clicked in earlier, because I feel it's all been very, very ridiculous. I feel a thought caused the OCD and the OCD caused the depression and I can't forgive myself for the lost time; it feels like it's made a misery of my early twenties. I was thinking of suicide most days, even though I wouldn't go through with it. The last week I've been pretty overworked, picking up extra shifts and my colleagues have been telling me not to and to not be afraid to say no and that I need to take time for myself. I've been feeling rather lonely down here in Wales; feeling as though I didn't fit in and as though I didn't really have any friends.
My grief for my Mum has rather, I feel, tinged my mood; I burst into tears at a colleague's New Year's party, nine days after she died and well, even though that colleague is always friendly towards me, I haven't been invited to any other of her events since and while I know that sounds silly, I wonder if I've isolated myself more than ever, especially as I've not been in the best mood. I've been missing a close confidante, feeling a lack of purpose in the world and feeling as though there's not really anything for me. I wouldn't mind a close friend I could just talk to, because I had friends at Uni and even after, but now with the deaths of my Nan and Mum, two years apart, I feel I've lost the two people I could always talk to and I've become distant from many of my friends by time and different paths. I could tell my Mum anything; we often went out together; I did a lot of things with her that I might have done with a close friend, if I had one. I've always been very socially awkward and this year have found it especially difficult; struggling to make conversation, and feeling awkward and withdrawn. I even felt resentment at how easy it seemed for everyone else to laugh and talk and socialise and make banter, when I couldn't seem to. I don't want it to be Christmas in four months, because it'll mean a year since Mum died and I still think about that night and how frightening and terrible it was. I miss her so much and don't feel I've really been living since. I wonder if my OCD and depression became worse after she died; I think I was trying to deal with it, in a kind of 'carpe diem' thing and it backfired. I just feel so alone; I know I have my Dad and brothers, but my Dad is very stiff-upper lip (although he has rather softened in that area the last year or so), and both my brothers are married and have their own lives. A wife to go to at the end of the day and be their companion and comforter. And I have no-one. I know I'm a little difficult; I like time on my own, but recently it feels as though I've been drifting, pushing myself and then wilting at the end of the day. I feel as though I want time on my own, but once alone I feel isolated and lonely. It's an odd paradox.
Yep, anyway. *shrug* Thanks for reading,

"I have come a long way on my journey. I've used many different positive methods to get to where I am now and I believe in them, I live by them but I just can't shake this sense of bitterness.
i feel bitter that I'm a fixer. I came to this forum like a drowning person looking for a raft and then bizarrely try to offer advice to everyone else, because I can't stop trying to fix. This is fixing is unhealthy and part of my problem. So even something good for me is turned into something messed up.
I'm bitter because of all small things I can't do, like babysit for my friend tomorrow because of how I'm doing. Or get a job helping people. Or drive a car. Or go on a plane. 
And I'm bitter because even now I have no formal diagnosis. And I've had to live with this from being a child. I'm so high functioning that even I didn't know how messed up I am. A process that I'm still uncovering in onion like layers. I work so hard but I'm still this broken head that I'm trying to fix (sense a theme). And I'm tired and I'm sad all the time. And I'm looking for validation from strangers which is also a silly idea when the slightest bit of criticism makes me spiral. 
I didn't ask for this.  I'm trying so hard for myself and my family. I'm committed to therapy. I'm committed to loving kindness and forgiveness methods. But at the end of the day I still have to be me.

"I'm feeling very confused about everything ocd at the moment and just need to get a few things off my mind.
My ocd is about counting/checking/touching or something 'bad' will happen, usually that someone close will become ill or die and I have always been able to see it that way but after learning more about this illness I now realise that it has been a part of my life much more than I previously thought. When I read about the various forms of ocd - contamination fears, magical thinking, the need to have orderliness etc, I can see myself in almost all of them, even if it is on a small scale. Sometimes I cannot throw away certain items that are of no use - does that make me a hoarder as well? Is this normal for every sufferer, to not fit into just one type of ocd?
In the past I have put certain things about myself, such as excessive shyness and lack of self esteem in my earlier years, down to school bullying. I have also suffered a certain amount of anxiety and depression on and off, I had a complete mental and physical breakdown after a bereavement, I have a lack of trust in people which I really hate and I cannot cope with any kind of change, not even positive change (after my son was born two and a half years ago I had post natal depression for over a year). I used to think all of this was down to past events but I am now having to question this. What a mess!!!!!!
Something I have been concerned about recently is that ocd might be taking me down the self harm route. This is very hard for me to admit to but I cannot share it with anyone else. Over this past year, on a few occasions and only when under the influence of alcohol, I have felt such self hate that I have slapped/punched myself about the head and on one occasion I even pulled out some of my hair. Each time, the following morning, I have felt completely disgusted and couldn't believe that I could do this to myself as I have never been a violent person. I am now very worried where this sort of thing can lead. Is this how SH starts?
I feel that I have so many things that need to be addressed, I don't know where to start.
Sorry to be such a misery but I really needed to clear my head and ask a few (no, a lot!) of questions.

I'm a little confused. I am currently doing some ERP. I haven't eaten with my fingers for years I always use a fork or spoon. This week I am to at least once a day eat something with my fingers having NOT washed my hands. I have found this really stressful but over the last week I have been doing it. However, today not only is there something in the press about our athletes, during the Olympics, not to shake hands to prevent illness, also some University Professor has brought our attention to the fact that money and credit cards can carry as much bacteria as a toilet seat and lastly I've just watched the BBC 1 programme """"""""Food Inspectors"""""""" who again say we are not washing our hands enough. This is where I'm confused how am I now supposed to continue my exposure when everyone around me is saying WASH YOUR HANDS. I'm also worried as I stroked my cat today before eating my sandwich, now I regret it.
What do you all think, should I continue with the exposure?

"Hi all
Been having a bad couple of days, feeling depressed and down in the dumps since my trigger earlier this week. Been struggling to stay positive at work and people have been asking me if I'm okay. Been going through mental ruminations but been trying to keep it at bay.
I had some friends over this evening and we had a lovely time. But I'm struggling to settle down to sleep and never seem to get enough rest. I thought I would write down some of what was bothering me and it's just made me feel worse because I wrote about how I've been feeling this way for over four years and if there's nothing to worry about, why did I worry for so long? And I feel I completely ruined my Mum's final year; she was terminally ill, I was stuck at home and trying to find a job and wrapped up in my own thoughts. Right through Mum's illness it was there and I just didn't engage with her because of more trivial matters.
This has all hit me at once and I hate myself and feel in a not great place; I've been feeling rubbish and stupid and worthless all weekend and feel as though I shouldn't be here. I feel no matter where I go the OCD will follow and continue to ruin my life and I'll let it. I fear never being happy because I'll never be able to engage. I don't like myself at all and feel I'm kidding myself every time I try and let go.

Just got a call and I'm being offered CBT - but it's an eight month waiting list.
I'm worried because a) one of the reasons I decided to self-refer is because I'm going through a particularly awful recent spike. What if, when I finally get seen, I feel ok - the CBT doesn't seem to be needed - and then I spike again once the CBT is over, but don't have the CBT to help me through??
And b) in the meantime, how do I get through - scared of the thoughts popping up? Do I just continue reading self-help books?

"Hello. I'm in a bit of a quandary. I'm a lawyer, and in this profession there are two big things lawyers can lose their professional license over: stealing money from clients and lying under oath. Sometimes I think my OCD might play into my profession a bit by making me think that I have to be ethically flawless in order not to feel like a hypocrite in front of a judge. For ten years I've been only licensed to practice in Massachusetts. It's been my goal for a few years to get my license in other state. Finally, I decided to fill out an application to get my license in a state outside of MA. The paper work and process has been taking a while. Because I've practiced in MA for at least five years, though, I wont need to take a new bar exam. Anyway, there is a part on the application which asks if I've ever been suspended from school (not including elementary school). In 1993, when I was 13 and in middle school, I was sent home for a week for pulling the fire alarm. A group of boys who I ran into in the hallway were challenging me to do it (which is not an excuse for me to have done it). I felt really bad afterwards when I realized the disruption that I caused. Anyways, I think that being sent home is considered a suspension, but I checked the box that said """"""""no"""""""" where it asked about prior suspensions and signed it under oath. 
Now every day I am feeling bad about it. How can I represent clients, I tell myself, and talk to judges with a straight face when I've said something untrue under oath? On the other hand, I tell myself well I'm honest when I work in court in front of judges, and I am fair to clients, I don't rip them off, I don't steel from them,  etc. Part of me says why should they be asking people about things that happened in middle school, and  how could they deny someone a license because of something that happened at a very young age so long ago. I can't figure out if OCD is making a big deal of not reporting the middle school incident, or if I really now need to write a letter to the board that received the application and tell them about the incident. I could say that I remembered it afterwards. If I do this it will also be a lie because I remembered the incident before signing the application. At least, though, I'd be letting them know what happened. If I write back and tell them the complete truth: i.e. that I got suspended and didn't initially put it on the application even though I had remembered it at the time, then the consequences could be severe: they can not only deny my application to practice in their state, they can also contact the board of bar overseers in my state and inform them that I lied on an application. If that happens, I could loose my law license permanently.  Please let me know what I should do.
I have no other way to make a living besides practicing law. My family and I moved into our first single family home last January, and me loosing my law license now could be a disaster. At age 39 it wont be easy to remake myself. 
Btw, loosing my law license is a big theme for my OCD in ways other than this as well. E.g. I think of all kinds of technicalities that could potentially lead to me being disciplined by the board of bar overseers.
Thank you.

My brothers met up with my dad the other day (he had come to London for the day for a meeting and met them afterwards - I couldn't get the time off work to go) and my dad was already quite drunk when they met him, then he just carried on drinking and got through about a bottle and a half of wine and a few pints of beer within the few hours that they were with him. He's drank excessively for many years and denies he has a problem because he """"""""can go without if he wants to"""""""" and he """"""""only drinks on a night"""""""". He rarely gets hangovers so that's not even a deterrant.
He becomes verbally abusive sometimes when he's drunk and he's just really irritating and being around him when he's like that makes me cringe. Apparently he was wobbling around on the platform and my brother had to take him to the station to get his train home. I'm 32 and my brothers are older than me.
There is nothing I can do about him drinking, but my brothers and I don't particularly look forward to family events because it's always the same - he gets drunk and acts stupid. My mum is sick of it too but she's glad because he's cut down somewhat recently. I don't know, or want to, how much he drinks nowadays but it makes me angry and miserable to think about it at all. Since my brother told me about the other day, I've felt really low. My brother is an alcoholic but he managed to stop drinking 4 years ago and hasn't had a drink since. I was drinking too much a few years ago so stopped drinking for 18 months and can now have the odd drink without feeling the need to continue.
I suppose I just wonder if anyone else is in a similar situation and if so, what strategies have you developed for coping with it? Am I over-reacting? Should I try to accept it and be less judgmental? Any suggestions/comments welcome.

"Feeling pretty discouraged.
I thought I was improving after having a bit of a setback a couple of months ago. Increased meds, trying to continue with CBT methods, but I'm just feeling a little defeated.
Seems like every day I encounter some trigger and I'm doing my best to just ride through with the anxiety but I'm so tired of the anxiety.
Main theme remains contamination.
Seem to be improving on a daily basis if nothing out of the ordinary comes up....well sometimes...actually yesterday I found I was triggered by a nothing encounter. I could see it was nothing and did my best to just let the anxious thoughts be. Today was an encounter with a more obvious trigger and I end up excessively cleaning.
I'm not sure if this is helpful but I'm trying to look at what I'm actually afraid of, rather than just letting it be 'contamination.'
So am I afraid of getting sick from encounters with poo?--e-coli? salmonella?
On a level I can see I can deal with those things if they were to happen. I don't have a big fear of vomiting...so what is it exactly? I don't have a compromised immune system so I should be able to deal with that stuff.
I know I have a fear of blame and responsibility for harm--so that's definitely a part of it. I fear I'm not being responsible enough in dealing with things.
On another level I think a lot of this is just a deeper existential fear. Here we are mortal, vulnerable...does it all just come down to a fear of death?

So depressed today. I have been dealing very well with my pocd lately but over the last few days it seems to have returned with a vengence. I seem to be finding it harder to deal with new spikes. What i have been trying to do is just to breath through them and not engage with them but the anxiety is so bad. Why would this start to happen again after i was doing so well?

Before when i got a spike i would be totally sucked in the millisecond i engaged with it. The inevitable then followed. Whatever it was i was thinking about at the time would become almost totally real to me the more i thought about it. Many times i would tell someone i trust on how i feel, because of how real these thoughts were. I really believed it. But In the past year i have managed to not engage with my thoughts so much. Sometimes successfully, sometimes not. But when i manage not to engage, i often get some clarity sometime later. That could be weeks, months later. Out of nowhere. My thoughts then feel absurd and i feel so embarrassed and vulnerable. Especially to those i have told. Not sure if this is common in ocd.

"I've had OCD(various themes) for most of my life and am learning to live with it.  A recent incident has left me feeling really guilty all the time and I'm wondering if it could be a different strand of ocd that I haven't experienced before.
I live alone and love cats. I live in a flat now and really miss the company of my last cat.  So I've just rehomed a cat. I chose this particular one because she's 18 months old and has always been happy  indoors and has never tried to go out. Also her previous owner said she would be happy in her own company while I'm at work (another of my concerns). I've only had her a day and it is taking her a while to settle in (which is to be expected). Problem is I'm feeling really guilty about giving her a home and worrying she won't be happy here and thinking she should be with someone who can give her access to the outdoors.  It's making me feel really miserable and anxious and I don't know if this is normal or if it could be ocd related.
Anyone have any advice or experienced anything similar? Would love to hear from you.","['guilt', 'OCD']",['theme'],"['theme', 'OCD', 'guilt']",1.0,,,,
"I did something very stupid over the weekend. Please let me try to explain. I am a filmmaker, and I am also someone who likes to listen to film score soundtracks. For some reason, I imagined that the music I was listening to was for a film where the plot had terrorists defeating their enemies. One thing led to another. I ended up doing Google searches for """"""""victory of the terrorists"""""""" and """"""""victory of Al-Qaeda"""""""". In terms of the second search, and because I had thoughts of going on hateful web sites, I feel convinced that the searches were for the purpose of going on hateful web sites for the purpose of acting suspiciously, which I did not do. I thought about it, but I never did it.
Now I am scared that these intentions were criminal, and that I was trying to do something illegal, even though I never went on any illegal or hateful web sites. At one point, I felt scared to enter the word """"""""terrorist"""""""" in Google because I felt like I was trying to search for hateful web sites. Even when I did the searches for """"""""victory over terrorism"""""""" and """"""""how to defeat terrorism"""""""" I felt like I was covering up for everything. I never meant to do these searches for any intention. It was just a stupid, horrible mistake. I wasn't thinking. My judgment was impaired, and my thoughts were racing. I feel like such a horrible person. I had just gotten over my POCD theme and now I did this, and it was just a horrible mistake. I wish I hadn't done this. I feel like someone will find out, and I will have to tell them that it was for a bad intent, and I'll get in trouble. I just wish that this would all go away.

"Hi y'all
It's my last day off for eight days, so here I am, making the most of a lie-in. I'm also really struggling with my feelings.
The last month I've been dealing with old OCD themes and it's been popping up at work, exacerbated by the fact that I've been put on shifts with not a great deal to do. My brain has been running over the same thing, over and over again and I've been stressed out. The crux of the issue is this: although I'm not a devout Christian, I still worry about my relationship with God and I've been into some pretty unconventional things that have caused me to worry - nothing harmful, just things that perhaps your average run-of-the-Mill Christian might not be into.
Anyway, I've spent a long time worrying about this. I made peace with the fact - pressed by my first psychologist, who is a Christian theologist - that I shouldn't be too rigid and it's good to be naughty, which is something pressed further by my darling late Nan, who was a Catholic and who was always quite cheeky!  But I've always struggled with how much is too much and wanting to set myself a line. 
Now, at work, I've discovered that two of my Christian colleagues are into the same thing; unafraid, unashamed, matter-of-fact. They believe in God and I've had conversations with them about it and it was just so...'what the heck.' I've spent most of my twenties worrying and they're fine with it. I know, I have OCD and that makes a difference but I'm just struggling to digest and feeling so guilty over the things I've done to myself; like I've made a fool of myself and over the bad thoughts I've had. I just worry about everything and it's getting to the point where my colleagues are starting to notice - my friend and manager spoke to me the other day, asking if I was okay because I've seemed stressed. But I've always been stressed, right from when I was a little girl.
It sounds stupid, maybe, but I can't help thinking it's not fair. Why is it so easy for everybody else? Why does everyone else get to worry about the ordinary things while I worry about the things inside my head which aren't really a problem? Why can't I stop worrying for one minute over the small stuff? Why is everyone else carefree while I have this weight on my shoulders?
I just feel like a complete moron. Why do I do this to myself?

"Hi all 
I hope you're all doing OK. 
Unfortunately I am not doing well at all I'm feeling really hopeless right now. I think I am maybe even verging on depression. In many ways I lack motivation to feel better because the moment I stop feeling low then ocd just comes roaring back. 
I have many themes but generally they revolve around one topic: am I monster, am I acceptable, etc. I especially obsess over this in relation to my marriage. I also obsess over our relationship itself, whether it's ok, etc.  I find it very hard to accept fault either in myself or my partner who I tend to put on somewhat of a pedestal. This is black and white thinking, I know. 
I am looking for a therapist now and I am also starting a course of fluoxetine  because I can't go on like this. 
At the moment I am stuck on an argument my partner and I had nearly two years ago. My partner has I think long forgotten about this. But I am totally obsessed with what was said, what it means about us, what it means about me, wanting to talk about it but not wanting to open it up again, feeling like there is this huge elephant in the room. 
It is completely destroying me. I can't imagine ever feeling at peace about it. 
I often feel like I can never relax again. 
Anyway I'm sorry for this huge ramble. Didn't know where else to turn.

"I sometimes worry that I may never find my way out of this wilderness that is OCD. I think it's being fuelled by past mistakes (really awful mistakes) which have trapped me in this mindset of 'Im a bad person.  I've tried to say to myself """"""""the size or scale of the mistake doesn't matter, mistakes are still mistakes""""""""  I've made these mistakes quite a few times, which then makes me think """"""""surely if I kept on making these mistakes, I must be a bad person?"""""""" I suppose this all falls into the rumination category, but I really need to get to the bottom of this as its starting to eat away at me. 
I need to leave a relationship as its making me unhappy and anxious, which is also causIng anxiety as if I leave then I will look at myself as a bad person for causing sadness in another person. But if I stay I know I will continue to feel how I do now; unfulfilled, under appreciated and abit depressed at times. None of this OCD stuff was happening before this relationship began, so I think this is a huge part of my problem
  For the first time in ages, I feel like I'm without hope. Alone. I'm worrying about the ramifications of calling time on this relationship and I'm driving myself into despair. please will someone just tell me what I want to hear. Trying to deal with these feelings of guilt and self loathing and anxiety and fear is proving to be a big burden.

"Hi everyone,
So it's 23:48 on the 31st December 2018. I'm sat here absolutely in bits. 
I'm 26, supposedly with my whole life ahead of me. A few weeks ago I managed, somehow, to wrestle myself to A&E because I was on the brink of committing suicide. Today, I still feel like I am at the end of the road. I begged them not to send me home but they did. My life is a catalogue of mistakes. The only thing that has kept me from ending it all is the love I have for my parents. However, it is becoming increasingly difficult to hold on to that.
I have been like this since I was 19. I have not had a good nights sleep for years. I dream vividly. From around 2:30am every morning, I wake up periodically. Every day I am shattered. My eyes are black.
It is my own fault, I accept. I have done some truly awful things. I am haunted every single day. I can, however, hold my hand up and say I truly sorry. I can also say, in all honesty, that that stuff is all in the past and I really cannot explain why I did what I did. Apart from it being some sort of effort to try and accept who I thought I was, in an attempt to try and stop the constant fear and rumination. It spiralled and I did things I am really ashamed of.
In more recent times I have found comfort in small things (even in typing this, I feel as though I don't deserve to find comfort in anything. Indeed, when I went to A&E, I told the doctor that I didn't know why I was there, because I don't feel as though I deserve help. Sure, 99.99% of the world would probably agree I don't deserve any comfort).
A few weeks ago I developed tinnitus from playing in a band. I have never felt comfortable on stage playing an instrument in front of people, however, it is a source of extra income. It has taken me to a depth of hopelessness I never thought possible. I can't do anything for it. 
This is probably a fitting punishment. I accept. But what is the point in living like this? 
If this is my life, what is the point of going on?
I'm not sure how many of you are aware of the works of Eckhart Tolle. In fairness to him, his teachings are very interesting and do offer a lot of relief for a lot of people. I like the idea of living in the now; it stops the cycle of rumination. And what he writes about the destruction of the ego makes sense. But then if you go along with everything he says, I just struggle to see what the point in anything is. Do I just sit in a bare room every day, staring at a wall, living in the 'now', as to not have an ego...
A life of mistakes. A debilitating condition. Every day struggle. What do I do?
  Happy new year. God bless you all.

"Man, i feel so so so so bad today. Last Friday morning i got a strange phone call, from a job that i had applied to about 4 weeks before, so i went to an interview the same day, was panicking real bad during it, when i told the guy i had ocd he says, real strange and confrontational """"""""whats that !"""""""" and this goes on for a few minutes untill he realises its the """"""""washing hands thing"""""""". but anyway, after having a panicky time at the interview i come home, and in the late afternoon i get a phonecall from this guy offering me the job and start a trial period.
Now this is a big surpise to me, and i was pretty worried at the time, i don't think im ready to be starting a job. It starts on wednesday 9am, and my ocd is to do with going to the toilet and what if i cant get acces to the toilet etc etc. Recently i've been really down anyway, after getting some bad news that i didnt get into my college course and have just been so down.
So this morning i woke up early, o i could get used to early mornings etc and head down to the tax office, and start panicking real bad and run off to the nearest toilet i could find. And all the way home im panicking, how can i stay 8 hours working when i cant go 15 minutes waiting in a line, so i get home and im really down...contemplating suicide because this is just getting rediculous, i feel like an invilid and wont amount to anything...
I actually got all the tablets i could together, and put a razor blade to my wrist, then the small part of my mind that is still rational just pops up and i run out of my house. I rang my GP, not my therapist because he only works on thursdays/fridays, and made an appointment.

"Hi Everyone
Last week my mother-in-law came to stay with us to visit with her grandson as she lives in another city. She has been down previously and seen me washing my hands etc my husband told her since I had the baby I became very anxious.
Over the last couple of months my husband has been telling me he has had enough of my ocd as it prevents me from doing certain things, going places and makes me difficult to live with he even said that there is no passion in our relationship.
This morning I broke down as he has been having a go at me again over the last few days. His mum came over to comfort me which was nice of her, whilst she did this she mentioned a few things that are very private for example my medication. I realised then that my husband had told her everything about what """"""""he's"""""""" been going through living with me, really personal things I felt so humiliated, ashamed, embarrased and helpless. I couldn't believe that he would betray me this way. I had asked him a few days ago if anything was said between them and he assured me that he had not said anything.
Nobody hates the OCD more than me or struggles with it on a daily basis and I acknowledge that I'm not quite the person that I was when we got married due to this condition. It is an illness that cannot be seen, I wonder if I had cancer and was debilitated if he would have a go at me.
He says that he can't put up with it anymore and needed to talk to someone, it still doesn't mean he had the right to devulge such personal information.
Life at the moment is really difficult because of some hurtful things he has said to me.

"I am feeling so rotten at the moment. My mind is going non-stop. I am questioning everything. Whilst at work I am trying to workout why I say certain things, how I look at fellow staff, if I am quiet etc. So I am accessing whether I am acting up, am I being genuine, am I choosing what words to say or not say. Then on top of that I have stories play out of conversations and interactions with staff. That go on, I find when it happens I try to question why I am entering into these stories, what am I gaining from it. It doesn't make one bit of difference. I just feel like I must be a very messed up person. Then on top of that I was given some bad news regarding a close family member....things are not looking good, but have to wait for confirmation of test results. I am gutted deep down and when I do start thinking about possible outcomes I just breakdown. However I am having some crazy thoughts go through my mind. They just come from nowhere. An example is - will they leave me money if they pass away/I hope it is bad because then that is more accepting to others. Then when requesting their partners contact number (to be there for them) I start thinking I don't care about them, I am just pretending and want to look caring. I cannot take it, my worst fear is losing people close to me and seeing people suffer. Yet I am having these thoughts.
I just hate myself for all these thoughts, I feel damaged beyond repair. I cannot do anything without questioning my motives. I like to believe I am there for others, that I am kind and caring, but I cannot be certain it is genuine. Is everything I do for self gratitude. Its like if I meet one of my parents for a coffee, I start getting thoughts like """"""""if I sit down first they will then be forced to order and pay for drinks"""""""", which again it hurts me so much. This is pretty much consistent and always has been, but it is kind of the norm that I feel that all these thoughts are evidence of being selfish and self-centred. I have tried allowing the thoughts to happen and then just continue with what I need to do, but it is seriously affecting my views on myself as a person.
I struggle because I want to have proof that I can be sure of my motives and being as a person, but everything is based on opinions. Even an action can be made for different reasons, it is easy to hide true intentions. It happens all the time in life. People say one thing but mean another, people can come across as sincere and well meaning, but then say something completely different behind your back. I am just so stressed at the moment, my mood is low, almost miserable to be around. At work I am finding it takes almost my whole shift before I can engage in a decent conversation.  Sorry for the length of this, just offloading. I find these thoughts hard to discuss in person, because I fear it will just show how selfish I am and that it is hard for others to comprehend. I recently began to discuss certain rituals I have to follow and how it is affecting work... I got no feedback (this was in a group session) at all and straight after the topic changed.

I couldn't even sleep last night with everything whizzing around...... I hate feel like I'm gonna have a breakdown and lose control of myself and reality
Any advice on how to accept this feeling and move on! It only started yesterday after the cbt, oh and the fact that I walked down a real long corrider to shops and thought I was dreaming and this has now stuck in my head
Any help would be appreciated.

"I feel so shaky and sick, I'm feeling so anxious. I can't help ruminating and thinking what if I'm a lesbian? At the moment I have no interest in men. I spiked when I saw a programme and there were these two gay guys who were in love but one of the guys parents didn't approve of him being gay.
I know my family and friends wouldn't have a problem with me being a lesbian, I'm the only one who has an issue with it. I've never been in love with a girl. I've never been in live before for that matter. I don't know what love even feels like. I don't know if I even believe in love. I've been infatuated with guys and have crushed on guys. I've only ever crushed on guys sexually and romantically. I think I've only ever admired females like celebrities because they're pretty or have a good figure.
I keep thinking what if I'm in denial and repressing my true feelings. I've only ever once had a lesbian experience but I was drunk and felt upset and confused afterwards, I didn't feel good. I was drunk and scared and wrote on my yahoo account that I """"""""enjoyed"""""""" the experience but I don't remember enjoying it or maybe if my mind altered the experience out of confusion or shock. I know it sounds like I'm making excuses.
But having said that when I'm drunk I always have the worst judgement. I've gotten with guys who I font find attractive in the slightest when I'm sober, but I get with them when drunk. Like when sober I wouldn't want to date them or have sex with them so maybe being drunk isn't the real you and you just do crazy **** and do people you wouldn't dream of when you're sober. It's like being on drugs, you don't know what you're doing and are not in control.
I'm also a commitment phobe and am scared of being in a relationship because it's so much drama, time and effort. I keep thinking what if it's because I'm a lesbian? I've always wanted a boyfriend but at times I'm just happy being by myself and I feel that having a boyfriend would cause too much agg. At the moment I'm happy being alone. At the moment I'm depressed and don't really want to be around anyone. My sex drive is low and it feels like I've gone off men . I feel like I want to sleep all the time and I don't feel like doing anything or going anywhere and I just keep on eating junk food. Is this a sign of depression? My head also feels fuzzy.

"Hey guys, how are you all doing? Good, I hope
I'm feeling a bit strange this evening, and was wondering if I could grab any advice?
Basically, what's bothering me is that the past few days, my setback in POCD appears to have subsided a bit and I have been applying the techniques I learnt in CBT and tried to stay calm and collective. So my POCD thoughts have really calmed down a lot, along with a few harm OCD thoughts that have been consistently prominent throughout my experience of the disorder. I still get them a little, but I'm feeling a lot better. Anyway, this evening I've just been relaxing and I put a film on to watch for some light entertainment. The theme of the film isn't one that I find particularly disturbing and I've never really had any problems with this kind of thing before, with the exception of when I was very young. To be honest,it's kind of embarrassing, but I might as well just get it off my chest anyway, hopefully it'll give you a chuckle But yeah, it's a typical film about alien invasion- bear with me for a moment. Anyway, so while watching it I began thinking about the possibility of life on other planets, which then led to thoughts about the nature of life in itself and morality and all the rest of it. Anyway, again, this isn't something that particularly bothers me and it's certainly not foreign to my mind. I used to think about that kind of thing from time to time, I'm sure everybody does. Yet, I began feeling anxious for some reason and just really weird... I've felt like this before, but this time it's over something so trivial and it barely even makes sense. I mean, one of the OCD thoughts I used to have that came with the harm thoughts was thoughts about the nature of morality, which the OCD targeted because I was so scared of being a bad person. I guess what I'm asking is: Can a thought that triggers anxiety be basically ANYTHING that your mind can perceive? Because this isn't the first time I've had weird anxious feelings over thoughts that don't make sense- I'm not talking about the typical kind either. Like, I used to obsess over philosophical questions like """"""""what is the meaning of life"""""""" and it caused me massive anxiety as well. I know this is just a phase, but I was wondering if anybody else feels like this sometimes, when you have a random thought and it causes anxiety? I wouldn't necessarily call this one an OCD thought, but I suppose it could be because I'm already obsessing over how I feel and why I feel like it. I think it might be because I bounced back from my POCD and now my mind is just so used to being anxious that it'll just find ANYTHING to be anxious about.","['talking', 'hope', 'anxiety', 'anxiety', 'OCD', 'Thought']",['theme'],"['talking', 'anxiety', 'OCD', 'Thought', 'theme', 'hope']",1.0,,,,
"Hi
i just wanted to post as im feeling quite bad these days (not that i want to bring anyone else down :a1_cheesygrin: !), my mood is much lower and in turn this is making my ocd rituals even worse, its a never ending cycle. im crying a lot more as well so i reckon i will have to up my dose of anti ds. (appointment on monday)
i was out on saturday night, had too much wine and ended up crying at the state ive got myself into with these blood type obessions (see previous post). i told my mum i was going to go home so i didnt spoil everyone elses night but they all ended up seeing me, so i then felt bad at spoiling their night but couldnt tell them why! i know alcohol is a depressant but it was the first time i was out and actually enjoying myself in a long while. anyway i cried myself to sleep and it so wasnt worth the sore head from crying and hangover the next day!
im now feeling even worse about burdening my mum with everything cos yesterday she forgot i was working and got quite upset when she couldnt get a hold of me, when i eventually spoke to her on the phone she was crying and said she was worried. i knew i had been putting a lot on her by telling her everything but i didnt realise how much it was affecting her. she keeps telling me shes there for me but i now think its really not fair on her for me to do that.
at my last appointment with """"""""psycho"""""""" man i had to write a list of things/goals i want to gain from this therapy, i came up with a list of 13!! so i hope that when i start working on these it will help with the overall situation. i really cant deal with becoming any worse than i am already.
anyway thats a long story short im just really concerned about my mum now, i cant keep doing this to her!
hope everyone else is well

Basically my theme this time seems to be a little of most classic ocd traits but the one that is causing me so much pain and anguish is basically being accused of of being a paedophile..even written down like this scares the heck out of me ?
Each time I seem to get over one thing, I find myself torturing myself over something else. I once looked after a neighbours 2yr old and helped him use the toilet as he was potty training. At the time, this was just a natural thing to do. However, my ocd has got a hold on this and has now convinced me that the police are going to come and arrest me as I have been reported by his parents for touching him inappropriatly. It doesn't help that we as neighbours fell out almost 2 years ago so I'm thinking they would do this out of spite. As much as I try to dismiss these thoughts, I can't as they are going around my head constantly.
My wait for therapy is at least another 10 months away and I'm so scared that my life is spiraling out of control.

"I don't really know why I'm even writing all this down as it probably won't help, and I don't really think there's anything anyone can do or say.
I am just feeling so low right now, I wish I wasn't here anymore. Everything is getting too much for me to cope with and I don't know what to do to make it better. I'm sick of fighting to just get up and get through every day and keep going through it all, when there's nothing left to fight for. I'm just totally losing my grip on everything. The way I feel now is that I'm going to be stuck like this for the rest of my life, and things are never going to improve no matter how hard I try.
I've been seeing my psych for a few weeks now, but haven't had an appointment for a while as she's been on leave - and I had to cancel my last one as I had to make an emergency Docs appointment because I was unwell and thought I might need to go to A&E. I've got another week to wait until I see her, as she's on leave again next week.
I've been implementing all the things she wants me to do and keeping up with my challenges - cutting down on the handwashing/checking my body for signs of illness, I slipped up when I was ill - but seem to have got back on track since.
But my anxiety has been really bad since I got ill, and it's not going down any, it's making me so depressed and exhausted - and it's caused me to start with some new illness related checking rituals which isn't good.
I am also really struggling with eating, it's getting to ridiculous proportions now and is making me feel more depressed, on a purely vacuous level - I look absolutely awful, bony, thin and drawn - just utterly disgusting, ugly and deformed. On a more serious level it is actually making me physically ill now as well, I am terribly underweight, worn out and suffering other health problems - but no matter how hard I try I just can't force a full meal down, just because I am so frightened it will make me ill.
I'm constantly stressing about food, eating and illness and it's ruling my life. My psych is going to tackle it all with me over the next few weeks, but I just don't think I can cope anymore - I've had enough and feel ready to throw the towel in. I've suffered for so many years and this now just feels insurmountable - like too much of a challenge to get over. I'm going to be 30 at the end of this year, and I feel like I won't get there - a big bit of me doesn't want to, I am just so tired and feel that there really isn't anything worth fighting for anymore. I'm not well enough to work, can't use public transport, can't drive as I'm too scared to get back behind the wheel, and am just utterly trapped in a routine of utter drudge just to get through each day only to wake up in the morning and find that yet again I've survived another night and have to do it all again.
I'm not really getting a great deal of support at home, in fact things are bad here at the moment - constantly walking on eggshells and being told I've got a bad attitude. When I was ill the other week, I was told in no uncertain terms I had to 'prove' I was ill (won't go into what I had to do, but suffice to say it was utterly insulting and embarrassing) as it was felt all round that I was making it up, depite the fact at one point I was on the floor, crying with pain - I wasn't making it up, and at least the Dr believed me.
I'm really sorry to rant on, I don't even know why I'm doing this I just can't see a way through or a way out anymore and I just can't cope anymore - I don't know what to do, feel like I'm being slowly smothered.","['writing', 'Thought', 'anxiety', 'anxiety', 'Rituals', 'disgust', 'underweight', 'Food', 'checking']",[],"['anxiety', 'disgust', 'writing', 'Thought', 'Rituals', 'checking', 'Food', 'underweight']",,1.0,,,
"Hi everyone,
I am looking for some help as I am coming towards the end of treatment for OCD and feel lost at the moment.
I’ve lived with OCD for about ten years, with the six in the middle being the most difficult. My problem relates to hoarding memories, mainly through a diary, and to writing and editing. I was diagnosed two years ago after finishing university, and put on a waiting list for CBT. I moved to London, began my first full-time job and managed to control a lot of my ritualistic behaviour. I have coped by keeping myself busy and distracted for the past two years.
Then, in the autumn, I began CBT at the Centre for Anxiety Disorders and Trauma at the Maudsley. My psychologist and I agree that my case is relatively mild. I am able to hold down a job and lead a normal life in certain ways. But although I have minimised my compulsive behaviour, I haven’t really addressed my obsessive thinking.
To give myself the best chances of improvement, I would have to destroy all the diaries and notes I have accumulated without looking through them, and make a massive decision to commit to tackling my OCD. I don’t think I can do this, and I feel very alone with the pressure of making this decision. I keep mulling it over, and find fault with every reason to take that leap for my own sake. Though destroying my records of the past in order to ‘live in the present’ seems like a great idea in theory, the concept doesn’t really mean anything to me. I don’t know how to do it. Then I look outside myself for a reason to change, but I don’t have anyone who really depends upon me getting better.
I’m very aware that the Maudsley is one of the foremost centres for OCD treatment and research, and that I’m extremely lucky to be receiving treatment there on the NHS. My rational self understands the truth of what I’ve learnt from CBT, and I don’t want to waste this opportunity I’ve been given. Since starting CBT, though, I’ve felt more confused and depressed than I was when I was keeping busy and distracted, and am on a higher dose of my medication than I have ever been. I’m not sure if the ambivalence I’m feeling means that I’m not ready to deal with my OCD, or if it means that I’m not trying, that I need to get a grip and make a proper effort.
I have two sessions left with my psychologist, both this week. I’d really appreciate any ideas or suggestions for how to deal with this. Has anybody else been through this kind of situation?
Thanks for reading,
Emily","['writing', 'Anxiety disorder', 'anxiety', 'anxiety', 'Compulsive behavior', 'outside', 'Medication', 'OCD', 'Treatment']",['obsessive'],"['outside', 'anxiety', 'obsessive', 'Anxiety disorder', 'Treatment', 'writing', 'Compulsive behavior', 'Medication', 'OCD']",,1.0,,,
"Hey guys
How are we all? My best friend came down today and took me out of my head for a while, so that was really lovely. We had a wonderful time.
It's my thirtieth birthday tomorrow and I'm feeling overwhelmed and a little ashamed of myself. Over the past few months I've fought a difficult OCD battle and I'm scared about the impact that the disorder is having on me. But I'm also scared that on some level, I've just given up and will let the OCD take over completely because I don't think that I deserve to be happy; happiness is something that belongs to other people, not to me. But on another level I've grown used to an OCD way of thinking. I have a lot of rumination in my head at the moment, a vicious cycle of thought and I'm scared of sabotaging myself.
But more recently, I've exposed myself to people who have made me feel as though I don't deserve to be happy - that I need to try harder as a Christian to resist temptation, obey God's voice, make sacrifices, etc - and feel like I don't deserve to enjoy the things that I want to enjoy. Even crazier, it's like on some level I want them to be a bit forbidden, a bit taboo? I know that sounds mad. I just feel very sad and more than that, I feel like I don't make an effort; the words of these people have been rattling around my head for days and months and I'm worried I'm quietly letting myself become brainwashed without a fight and keep wondering 'what if they're right?' and seeming to deliberately make life difficult for myself. I've been very, very tired. I've had a lot of love - and birthday cards sent - for tomorrow and yet I feel I deserve none of it and that I won't get out of this. It's just making me want to curl up quietly and die, before I make things worse for myself.
I know this is a depressing post the night before my thirtieth birthday, but I feel like I need to be honest as I'm honestly feeling frightened that I have nothing left to give; I'm scared of self-sabotage and of good things in case I ruin them. For example, I was looking forward to seeing my best friend today, but I wouldn't let myself get too excited in case I wrecked things. I forgot once or twice that it was my birthday tomorrow at all. 
I know this is a weird post; I'm a worrier and I'm used to worrying, which makes me doubt myself. My best friend was pointing out all the good things I have and I feel bad for not making more of them; it makes me feel ungrateful and fixated on one or two things and to that end, that my family would be better off without me if I can't focus on the things I have. 
Lots of love and apologies if I sound strange. Thankyou for all the support even though I sound like a maniac.

"Hi all,
Really wanted to take the opportunity to get the stress that I have off my chest. I feel like I need somewhat of a refresher. Been on Aripiprazole now for about 6/7 weeks which has been pretty hard going over to but starting to come out the other side despite being on a weak dose. My OCD has been somewhat exacerbated since the change over and I find myself doing some things that I haven't done a lot of in a while like washing my hands a lot more than usual. I'm wondering if there are other things that I can do...
One thing I have noticed that the hierarchical system that has been suggested where you rate things by how difficult they are and then take them on one at a time but I find that system difficult because a) there are so many and b) I just don't feel like doing them is not progressing anything. 
I think one of the sheer problems really is the number of different OCD problems from struggling to walk past a dirty walk or a bin to wondering whether I have urine on me. I genuinely don't know for example if everybody pees themself a little after they go for a pee. I always seem to have wet patches and then I spend ages avoiding anything touching my lap. I am constantly aware of anything dirty on the wall or doors and because of my brother there are a lot of stains on the wall from his food or drink that he spills. 
I actually feel like I have to ignore the feeling of worrying about  touching things that I know aren't clean. Like, I know my brother pees, poos and touches himself and doesn't wash his hands and I have to handle the same things. The only other way around it is not touching anything. But feeling that I have touch them makes me sick. I can't even touch my used underwear without washing my hands and panicking and if I touch my privates, I really panic. I can't really touch my privates at all in any way. Or my bottom actually.  It's all a mess and I'm really embarrassed, angry, confused, upset and other feelings.

It was brave of me, and now I know that nothing bad will happen if I do resist or stop doing a ritual altogether.
The 4 steps is good, but now I am learning to attack these rituals head on. I enjoy this forum and am glad to be a member of OCDUK and long may I continue on these boards and I wouldnt have got to where I am if I hadnt sought help.
A tip from me is, try to stop doing a ritualistic procedure ,ie, have to turn the taps on before you turn the light on and dont let the urge niggle away. Then after a while, you will know that nothing bad will happen if you dont. If you can, tyr and resist the 4 steps. If a mental ritual comes into your head just think """"""""It is OCD again. Nothing will happen if I resist it"""""""". It is a long way for me, and I am in the early days but I am gradually learning to resist these dreaded rituals. CBT will no doubt help me further.

"Hi all,
I recently called a support group and spoke to an advisor who listened to what I had to say. Whilst he did state that he wasn’t a Doctor, he did say that what he had heard from me did point towards OCD. My partner always thought that I had OCD and I think I have now accepted that I probably have.
My ‘thing’ appears to be security, protection of my family, hoarding, organising and doing everything to perfection… if I know I can’t do a literally text-book ‘perfect’ job I very rarely bother trying or delay a task until I have the best tools / equipment / materials. I recently erected a fence at the rear of my property… it looks like it was engineered and installed by NASA. Considering it was only three panels / 4 concrete posts it took me a very long time and caused me some sleepless nights. It is however ‘perfect’ even if I do say so myself! :-) I will busy myself doing trivial / pointless tasks if I know I can do them ‘perfectly’ rather than get started on a job that I know will take me an age to finish.
I recently erected a shed and have fitted three high-end insurance grade iron hasps & staples to the door each with insurance grade ‘15’ (maximum security) motorcycle padlocks, specialist high-security hinges, hinge-bolts, reinforced the door with steel plates, double-skinned the inside of the shed with high-tensile steel mesh, tremor sensor alarms to door, window and panels, wireless ‘silent’ alarm linked to house alarm (ADT) and various locks and anchor point securing property inside.
Four 24/7 recording colour cctv cameras, safes, ADT alarm plus secondary Yale alarm with literally every single door and window covered, wireless smoke / heat alarms linked to ADT, drop-in steel braces to side and rear doors, tremor sensors to outer doors, anti-climb razor spikes to prevent intruders reaching rear of property, wheelie-bin secured to wall so cannot be used as a climbing aid and two dogs; Venus the Rottweiler and Leo the Shar-Pei.
I have recently left the Police to hope to re-train to become a Paramedic. I was of course familiar with criminals who live in my local area and obviously got to hear and see a lot more than what Joe Public may be privy to. I can assure you that in this case ignorance is indeed bliss! However, I recognise that fortifying ones property to such an extent isn’t ‘normal’. Especially to how much money I have spent doing so.
I understand that the following may not necessarily be a symptom of OCD but I also have ‘fads’ which involve buying and collecting things to obsessive levels. This so far has included; Wooden Thomas the Tank Engine toys for my son, (live)Marine fish and corals, marine fish equipment, carnivorous plants, cacti, tools, turtles and terrapins, gym equipment / free weights, ‘Adidas Originals’ trainers, Star Wars Lego for my son, mountain walking equipment, getting tattoos etc etc
I will spend vast amounts of money on ‘fads’ like the above and strive to by the very best I can afford (or more often, can’t afford!) and the fads only tend to last a month or two before I find something else. This of course adds to the hoarding!
I also have a deep interest in theology and religion. I am not a religious nut, do not go to Church, do not hold any radical opinions on things but like reading religious theory and new ideas. I do hold a belief in a Creator though but like to try and tie in my beliefs with evolution and science... Anyway, long story. I will also soon be Freemason! I mention this as I have read that religious / theoretical interests can also be a sign of OCD
I feel crazy writing all this stuff for complete strangers to read but would appreciate the chance to talk about it!

"Hello All
Well I don't know where to start. This is taking quite a bit of stress writing this, please forgive me if I ramble. I have never ever in the 16 years I have suffered with OCD actually tried to face up to it, always pushing it aside, thinking talking about it will make it worse and making excuses for all my stupid, stupid acts. But I have read so many of the posts in here (through tear filled eyes) and phoned and spoken to someone at OCD-UK (yes crying then too) and I have decided to take the plunge.
I have just come back off holiday where I found my OCD to be probably the worse it has ever been and I broke down when I got home to my friend, my Mom, then finally my husband. My OCD makes me touch things over and over, counting - endless counting, retracing steps, reading sentences over and over and over. In fact, doing EVERYTHING over and over.
Anyway, to get to my point. I have booked to see my doctor (who's on holiday, utterly selfish of her) but it seems there are some very positive people in here and I have spent the last week forcing myself to just STOP IT. That's all I've done. I've picked up on certain things people have said and watched the second half of the Channel 4 documentary and i am going to keep reading all the posts people put in here for inspiration (and hopefully help anyone if I can!) Now in the past, when I've tried this, something will happen to make me think it's because i haven't been doing my rituals (even the washing machine breaking) and this is where I would like to ask if people know it can be beaten. Please, please could someone give me inspiration because it is what I am clinging too (ok, I am now close to crying and my contact lenses will have to be changed yet again).
I have no doubt I shall spend the next few days stressing that no-one will answer or care (did I mention paranoia was another part of my anxiety???)
Take care

"Hi,
Finally my search for a therapist yielded a result. I found one and went to a session this afternoon. I felt that i can trust her and she was really patient with me, warm and sencere. I trusted most of what she said to me and she showed an excellent understanding of my situation.
I will be seeing her twice a week (upon my request) because i feel i have many things to tell her. She also appreciated my openess and honesty, i told her that i want to get the most out of each session.
First of all i want to apologize if what is written down here will make some people spike. I totally dont mean to make anyone uncomfortable on this forum, particularly people who suffer from HOCD who may read this.
What surprised me that she asked me to stop the exposure am doing. I view pics of nude men and ruminate daily about senarios involving me having intercourse with another man. She says in her opinion and the school of thinking she belongs to that such exposure will create habituation, then acceptance, then will lead to action! she thinks that what i am doing is connecting chains of new behaviour to eachother and this will result completely in a new behaviour (belief) that eventually will lead me to practise what i used to fear the most.
I discussed with her that the exposure is a very common way of treating HOCD and its been used by many therapists but she said it doesnt mean always its the best way especially when there is cultural differences.
I do trust her and she is very nice in contrary to other therapists i saw and i will keep seeing her, but i like to hear different opinions from you guys on this forum about what she said.
Any suggestions or thoughts will be appreciated.

"Hi all,
I'm very nervous to be posting this as i have never really spoken about my possible OCD! Ok My background is, i am 23, psychology graduate (irony) and i have always been a very anxious and worried person. Since i a child i have always wanted to please people and i can remember as a child having rituals to ensure bad things didn't happen to my family , like touching something many times or saying something over and over to a picture of a family members. Now i am older , its isn't like that any more , now it is more thought rituals than physical ones even though they are still present. For example i will need to have the same thought going round my head 10000 miles an hour to stop me thinking bad things will happen. I am exhausted with contently living on the edge of fear that my thoughts control the safety of people and prevent bad things from happening to myself and people i love with all my heart- when i know these thoughts do not control that:(- It is so hard to go day by day trying not to allow these thoughts to control me. I have a good life with troubles that everyone faces but the smallest thing can set these thoughts off then i am on edge or sometimes i even find myself looking for things to put me on edge. MY family and partner know i am an anxious women and are very supportive but they do not know the full extent of how deep this goes as i do not want them to worry and to be honest as i am wanting a career in the field of psychology i feel totally embarrassed by this. I just really want people to talk to and to share this burden with who can relate to what i am going through and i hope in some way i can return the favour.
Thanks to you all,

"Hi Everyone
My daughter suffers badly from OCD, she has been in a psychiatric hospital for 8 months with it last year and is now in mental health supported housing, which is pretty useless in terms of recovery
The NHS professionals she has seen so far have been pretty limited in their knowledge of severe ocd, especially mental rituals, ruminations, which is what my daughter suffers from most, and have not been able to help her. She is being referred to London, yet again, but not sure whether that will happen or not.
So we are looking for a therapist in Manchester area, psychologist hopefully, someone who has worked with OCD before. My daughter wants to break all her rituals herself, but fears a breakdown or further deterioration, so needs someone reputable who understands the condition well and can work with her through it.
If anyone has any information, please let me know as we are pretty desparate now, and want to avoid a further hospital admission if she gets any worse again.

Similar theme to my last post, I'm still struggling with motivation to get better.
I was wondering if anyone could share where their motivation came from to get better? I've dealt with the main pressing concerns of OCD which were stopping me from functioning daily. But now I am just completely ambivalent about the rest of my OCD issues.
I tried to motivate myself with """"""""it's not fair that I can't do X Y Z because of OCD"""""""" and that sort of worked a bit, but it quickly ran out of steam.
I've tried goal setting, but I just couldn't really make any.

"Hi All
I have just had the most terrible traumatic last couple of weeks. My step dad died after going into hospital for what we thought was just an operation. He was only 56. He was in for a few weeks and I have had to travel up from Birmingham to Lancaster then onto Barrow several times. One minute we were told he was improving, the next minute he was deteriorating. I have had to try and hold it together for my Mom, brother and step sisters and step brother. The emotions have been up and down and up and down. I have been trying not to cry in front of my Mom as she is upset enough yet I want to sit and cry for a week.
Needless to say, my ocd is through the roof. I've been telling my Mom I'm ok. I can't have her worry about that too. But I've lost all my strength. I was fighting the ocd so well. I always try and and advise people to force themselves to combat the rituals etc. But I can't do it myself.
I could really do with a bit of advice of how to get the strength back, if anyone knows.

I had my first appointment on Tuesday, after about 10 months of waiting. It was a very one sided affair, with me talking excessively. But I know what people mean when they say that therapy can cause anxiety... after about 30 minutes my OCD (Pure O) kicked in a little and I began to worry that I would blurt out something fictional, hurtful, a false confession... anything that would make me look like a nutter.
As a test I'm trying not to drink for 10 days - not with a mind to giving up, but just as a 'mental strength' exercise. For too long, I've taken the easy way out and it has often led to 5 drunk nights a week and the occasional incident of getting high.

"Hi all. I have been suffering with OCD for about 20 years but just thought it was me, so now after relising and being diagnosed with ocd i am starting to understand it. I really think i am going to learn a lot from these forums and i will be thankful for any help and advise you can give me. I am suffering from bad thoughts ocd and washing hands.
Edited April 13, 2010 by Darren","['washing hands', 'Thought', 'OCD']",[],"['Thought', 'OCD', 'washing hands']",,1.0,,,
"Just a few words to introduce myself.
I haven't been diagnosed with OCD, and at this point I don't really want to involve any professionals, I think I would rather try to get through this with more informal support.
But at the moment I am going through a bit of a sticky patch, so I looked around online and thought maybe I could get a few ideas from here.
All my life as far as I can remember I have used numbers, colours, patterns, in odd ways. I could never wear a watch when I was younger, always had to have my socks even, used to touch things a certain number of times or touch things unnecessarily. Most of it I forced myself to stop as I grew up and realised it wasn't what everyone else did. I can now wear a watch, wear uneven socks, and although I still see patterns and have difficulties around certain numbers, it's more annoying than debilitating. Other stuff like curtains, duvet, cushions need to be arranged in a certain way, I am particular about various things being in their place, but really it's not too much of an issue.
My main issue is cleanliness. I used to have a few issues with cleanliness, but recently it's got worse. A recent period of stress has seen me washing my hands far too much, taking too many showers in a day, cleaning my home too much, that sort of thing. Going out in public is very difficult because everything is dirty, I fear public transport and avoid going out if at all possible. What really made me sit up and think I need to do something about this, is a few days ago my kitchen was so """"""""dirty"""""""" that I had to throw away all the food and most of the equipment. I then had to bleach and scrub everything that was left several times, and can now only use a small area of my kitchen as the rest is still too dirty. I am having trouble eating because everything is contaminated, even items which were on my """"""""safe"""""""" list (such as vegetables which have been frozen and then boiled, my mind used to be secure that the process of freezing and boiling killed any contaminants). I know this is all spiralling out of control, and I'm not quite sure how to stop it.
If anyone has any thoughts, I would be very grateful to hear them.","['OCD', 'washing hands', 'fear', 'Food', 'process', 'Thought', 'kitchen', 'boil']",[],"['boil', 'process', 'kitchen', 'washing hands', 'fear', 'Thought', 'Food', 'OCD']",,1.0,,,
"(Warning - philosophical content, may trigger some)
Hi everyone,
I am not currently diagnosed with OCD, but I think I do have it. I've had excessive rumination about a certain theme for nearly a year now. I constantly question what life is, what I am, I think stupid things like as I am pretty much a bundle of cells what if I were to fall apart right now? I think things like what if the ground fell beneath my feet at any minute, both things which I know won't happen, they are just irrational fears. I think things like what is the point in life if I am just a bunch of chemical processes. Do I really control me? Most of me I don't control like if I could choose whether to sleep or not, I wouldn't. But I have to and it's out of my control. I've sort of gone beyond the whys and how's of universe creation and I seem to really get into the nitty gritty of things which GREATLY affects my life. Right now I have been unemployed for years from anxiety and it's only getting worse. I need to change if I do in fact want to live a worthwhile life. I've started responding to each thought with """"""""No no no no no, this is an OCD thought"""""""" and it stops them in their tracks, and I don't know if this is right or wrong at all, but it's certainly been showing be how often they happen. Sometimes it's 3 times a minute. I am just flooded with these thoughts and I'm afraid the NHS will think I'm psychotic or something, and I can't afford to go private.
I would love so much to take life for granted again and not question every little thing! I'm not enjoying this journey. I'm not appreciating it like I should. Everything makes me ruminate because I can't escape my subject of rumination. I do wonder why I am still trying with this thing called life. But I guess part of me says """"""""You will get out the other side of this - I know it.""""""""
I think what would help me more than anything is a worthwhile occupation. I would love to start volunteering, having been too anxious to do before (now I am just fed up of the anxiety and want to LIVE before I go officially nuts ) which will give me a nice thing to fill my mind in the mornings and at night. Those times are when my rumination is the worst. I used to love that delicious feeling you get when you lay your head down at night and can't help but think of the busy and positive day you've had, with a smile on your face. The last time I had one of those nights, it's got to of been when I was an early teen. I am now 21.
I would say I have been significantly impaired with anxiety for 7 years. Most of that time I have been living with my now husband (who i started going out with at 15) who has been my carer in many ways.
Underneath is all, I am nothing like what I am on the surface. I am a bubbly, sociable, fun-loving, risk taking go-getting person who has been reduced to the sofa in her house at one point.
I have gone from having lots of potential and support from friends to having no friends, no support at all, no qualifications, nothing to my name. I am essentially a blank canvas, a little broken but I figure I can be repaired and painted on. I just want to learn what to paint and how I should paint it.
Thank you for reading this and I would appreciate any advice you could give me on the topic I started this thread about (before my ramble!)","['fall', 'fear', 'joy', 'OCD', 'anxiety', 'anxiety', 'Thought', 'process']","['rumination', 'theme', 'excessive', 'irrational']","['rumination', 'anxiety', 'process', 'fall', 'fear', 'joy', 'Thought', 'excessive', 'irrational', 'theme', 'OCD']",1.0,1.0,,,
"Hi , this is my first post here. II have battled with OCD for about 12 years ,all around HIV concerns and discarded needles . During this time I have kept z good job and had 2 kids and had gone from being more or less trapped inside my head to living a normal life and had been more or less free of OCD for about year and then had a spike a few months back and been in free fall since then.
I think I saw a syringe at a train station , this brought my OCD back to the forefront of my life , it was absorbing me . To ease my pain I spoke to an HIV expert in London. Who told me even if I got injured by the needle there is no chance of HIV , it just can't happen and no one ever had got HIV from a needle world wide .I still had s blood test to ease my fears , I felt fine was over my little blip I though but then I was out with my kids and came across a small capped insulin needle - panicking i picked it up , threw it away . An hour later OCD had to know , I got it out of rubbish stared at it for hours...... Next day I even uncapped to reveal the needle , this sent me crazy . I started panicking that ice hurt my kids and given them HIV , it got to a point where I considered having them tested even though I know nothing happened to them. In despair I called an OCD expert , unfortunately their treatment was suited to me . I have since gone back on meds and are booked in to the priory next week , I'm seeing Anne potter to help me .

"Hi, this is my first post here. I registered a while back, but I had to spend ages trawling through member profiles just to convince myself there was nobody here that would somehow recognise me - stupid I know.
I've been suffering from a number of problems since as long as I can remember, and it's only recently that I've managed to admit that to myself. I guess I'm posting here to try to make it official to myself that I do have problems and I probably need help with them. I've read through a lot of websites on mental illnesses and it seems like OCD is the closest thing to what I have, but I really don't know for sure. I get disturbing thoughts and pictures, but I don't really have any cleansing rituals. Usually I just have to snap myself out of it like make a conscious """"""""stop it"""""""" thought and then I'll be ok. Sometimes I have to place my hand on the top of my head. I don't know why, but I just find that relaxing. I've had problems sleeping recently too. Sometimes when I'm trying to sleep I'll feel myself drifting off then panic for some reason and jolt myself up suddenly. It's like I can feel my breathing slow down and for a brief moment it feels like I'm dying. It doesn't happen every night, but whenever it does it'll happen several times before I can get to sleep.
I keep telling myself that I'm really ok, I'm just being stupid and if I pulled myself together I'd be able to deal with it. Sometimes I can, its not like it affects me all the time or anything, but there are always some bad days in amongst the good ones. Over the last few months I've done pretty much nothing with myself. Every time I have a bad day it's like I need a few days rest. Even though I've been resting since the start of the year I feel shattered all the time like I need some time off. What on earth is time off when I'm sat on my **** locked away in my room all the time?
I guess I should seek help, get a formal diagnosis or whatever. To be honest I don't think I even know how I'd get one. I certainly don't like the idea of trying to explain all the stupid things in my head to somebody. I'm scared they'd tell me I'm crazy, and even more scared they'd tell me there's nothing wrong and I'm making it all up. Most of the things that scare me and upset me I don't think I could possibly put into words, and if I can't understand it myself, how could I make anybody else understand?

"This is my first post. I am a 17 year old girl and have had HOCD for the last couple of years, though getting significantly worse to the extent that I found myself not able to walk through doorways normally, forever touching things etc. my symptoms have recently taken a horrible turn into POCD (OCD concerning peadophilia for those who don't know). This is absoltely horrible and had made me so down over the last few months - I have tried to avoid children at all, which is hard beause in my job there are often children around. I feel helpless and hideous. Reading the help thread concerning sexual OCD, the """"""""upstairs downstairs"""""""" thread has helped, but I still am scared that i actually do feel things for children as they seem very real to me and this appals me. i have horrible mebtal images which make me feel like a disgusting person.
Until relavitevly recently, I have been able to bear the whole """"""""am I gay"""""""" rituals, but ver the past months they have gotten worse and worse. my family has obviously noticed and I could tell they are worried. I have had boyfriends in the past who i have really liked, but am now feelingi would be a fraud and whatnot to go on dates with boys and stuff when I feel liek this. i really has taken over mylife so, so much and is not helped by the fact that my friends seem quite homophobic, constantly using """"""""you're so gay, oh wht a gaylord"""""""" as insults.
I eventually told my mum about this OCD after she picked me up from a late shift at work where, under stress, due to being busy and all sorts of OCDs, I had been tapping things, puttign things up/down all night, to the extent where I was sure customers could notice. i felt horrible; i could bear the """"""""gay"""""""" OCD but not the POCD. My syptoms include: horrible mental inages that I can't get out of my head, opening/closing doors a certain number of times, touching things, turninglights on and off, getting in/out of bed (and then as soon as I touch it having to go walk in/out of the door again), getting in/out the shower, knocking on the door a certain amount of times, i used to be afraid of teh number 3 but gettign over that, crossing words out or deleting them after I type them and then writing them again. thids is worse in stressful situations such as signing up for somethign online, or exams, like right now, where I have to cross out so many words and write them again, soemtimes more than once, so am wasting vital time and probably making my work unreadable to the examiniers!! the list goes on...
I went to see my GP and she has referred me for consulling, but I don't want to tell her all this; she probably thinks its a simple case of stress or somthing, but the images and things I get are bad i couldn't tell her. I would just like somebody to give mea comment, anything really, especially sommebody who has been through what I have would be great

Is anyone else like this, everything I do is tainted with my OCD. I am worried that she will say that she wont be able to help me.","['Rituals', 'Thought', 'surprise', 'writing', 'OCD']",[],"['surprise', 'writing', 'Thought', 'Rituals', 'OCD']",,1.0,,,
"Hi
I've been quite calm the past couple of days, had slight rumination which wasn't bothering me anxiety wise but still had the belief which has been concerning me. I don't know if it was because it has been the run up to my first therapy session so I've been doing better so that I'd cancel it. But I haven't cancelled it.
Anyway I'm due to see a therapist tonight after work and I'm finding that I'm starting to panic again. The thoughts are here, I'm pulling them to bits again. I'm scared that it's going to make me feel worse when I come out of there after the past few days where I've not been great but not been suicidal like the past few weeks. I'm scared that I'm making everything up or trying to justify a bad thing using this as an excuse. What if this therapist thinks I'm making things up and I'm just some stupid girl who's had ocd in the past and using it to justify a night out where she's got drunk and forgot. Will he be able to tell if I'm making things up, would he tell me? 
I feel sick, I feel like I want to split with my partner because it's never going to be normal again. What if I am saying I'm waiting for this 'mood' to lift to see clarity when really all I'm doing is waiting for myself to believe the lies I've told myself before now? I remember thinking that if I found out my partner hadn't cheated, there would be no going back and it wouldn't be good again. Why would I think that? Maybe all this is one big lie and I'm so disappointed in my actions that I'm trying to convince myself it never happened. 
I'm so sick of this. 
Even writing this I feel like I'm lying. I'm questioning the fact I'm questioning it. I'm getting the urge to contact people from the night, I had this for a while but it went away because I knew it could make things worse as the people involved are not good people and they could possibly lie and I'm not sure I'd believe them anyway.

I've had OCD since I was 19 - I'm now 38 - I thought I'd had it beaten in a way, back to where my life was making sense. But over the last 4 months its come back - to the point where I'm crying all the time. It scares me because I don't want to be like I was when I was 19.
At age 19 OCD reared its ugly head. I thought I was going mad, I started thinking strange things, wanting to wash my hands, have more showers, at first I coped and then it got to the point where I copuldn't go out of the house. Thank God my family were supportive, I drove them round the bend, and they didn't know what on earth was going on, but they did everything they could tohelp me. We eventually saw something on Oprah Winfrey show back in 1988 - where people where suffering from OCD - i'll never forget, one per person in America had to keep checking envelopes, he thought if he didn't open the envelope his daughter would die. There was another girl who was washing her hands time and time again. Luckily my mum was watching this and clicked that this is what I was suffering from. Mum and I went to the Drs, they didn't know what on earth we were talking about. Then we heard about this other GP who might help. I went to see him as a private patient first of all. I explained how I was feeling, I cried loads, went through 2 boxes of tissues. After speaking with him, I felt better. He knew where I was coming from. Thank God. I saw him as a private patient for a while and then as NHS patient. He was so good. I started taking Clompirimine - Anafranil - over the course of time I started to feel better. I didn't see a therapist, I couldn't face talking to anyone else, it was hard enough teliing my family and the GP. Anyway, the GP and the medication helped. After 2 years I was back socially, going out with my friends, started working again and was able to COPE with the OCD. I went travelling round Australia, and bought a house. Fab. Everything has been ok, yeah I 've had OCD hiccups along the way but life was OK - until now - at the moment I feel like I'm losing it again. I feel like I'm going mad. Everthing is getting too difficult. That's how I found OCD UK - i went on the web in work looking for more information about OCD. OCD uk was the first listing through google. I've become a member, get the newletters and am now on a chat forum. I just feel a little better knowing that there are other people out there who know what it's like. I'm at the point now where I'm going to do some searching for CBT Therapsit - I want to beat this thing AGAIN - to the point where I'm living instead of existing.","['checking', 'washing hands', 'Medication', 'talking', 'Thought', 'OCD']",[],"['talking', 'washing hands', 'checking', 'Thought', 'Medication', 'OCD']",,1.0,,,
"Hello everybody,
This message turned out to be really long, but I have kept this inside for so long and it all just kind of burst out, so if you get bored, big apologies.
I'm finding it really weird to be be writing this to be honest. But here goes. I've had OCD and problems with paranoia for a few years now. On the outside I think most people think i'm pretty together, but that's the problem really, I keep the truth completely hidden as much as I can.
I smoked cannabis for 10 years basically heavily and every night from the age of 13 and took a few other drugs frequently in my late teens, but managed to quit smoking cannabis last year.
For the past couple of years I have been gripped by one particular OCD which I have never heard of in anyone else, despite loads of searching on the net. It basically revolves around the idea that somebody has spiked/'contaminated' my drink or food (it sometimes even extends to an aversion to surfaces) with drugs, particularly ecstacy and lsd. It's weird because having become so used to this constant wiping of beer can mouthpieces, watching of drink when at the pub, or split second decisions that the sandwich I have just bought is 'not OK', I follow the behaviours that my brain has become used to because I know that it is easier to just go along with the OCD. Honestly the amount of food and drink I waste is ridiculous. The behaviour peaks with stressful times, but never actually goes away. It's now at a stage where I genuinely know that it is of course ridiculous to imagine that some unknown person would have bothered to do such a thing, but the behaviour I use to deal with it is so ingrained, it has become like washing your hands after going to the toilet.
The big trouble is, or actually was a lot more than it is now, is that when I get the thoughts, which are involunary, it induces a panicky feeling, adrenalin, which unfortunately is pretty similar to the beginnings of how you feel when you take certain drugs. As you can probably imagine, the phrase 'vicious circle' pretty much sums it up.
Another, much less constant aspect of my behaviour is the onset of paranoia, or anxiety attacks. These often revolve around the idea that unknown people, usually gangsterish, are out to get me for something that I have done, sometimes for a reason that may have the slightest faint place of origin, but most of the time, it's just that a car has been behind me for a while, or that I see someone tough looking at me. I think it's important to say here, I have absolutely nothing to do with any part of that world, but have been exposed to it when I was younger, which i think is maybe part of it, I just feel so different from that whole way and I am terrified by it.
But anyway, I'm basically sick of being scared, I feel like there is so much that is beautiful and interesting and fun to be experiencing, but i'm too busy concentrating or whether or not the ice cream I just bought has been laced with something.
If any of you have any words of help or advice it would be massively appreciated. Just to give you some idea of how it works, in the time that it has taken to write this, I have wiped the mouthpiece of my can of beer, heard noises from the (fairly busy) back of my apartment building and been vaguely scared of it being someone 'coming to get me', and been struck by the idea that what if someone who wanted to do me harm could be reading this forum and somehow identify me by it?
Anyway, hope you have something to offer, thankyou very much for reading.","['syncope', 'writing', 'outside', 'washing hands', 'toilet', 'Thought', 'anxiety', 'anxiety', 'interest', 'hope', 'Food', 'unknown', 'OCD']",['spike'],"['outside', 'anxiety', 'washing hands', 'OCD', 'interest', 'writing', 'syncope', 'toilet', 'Thought', 'spike', 'unknown', 'Food', 'hope']",1.0,1.0,,,
"Does anybody ever get random memory flashbacks when they are in the midst of a strong obsessive-compulsive behaviour?

I do. It's always really trivial memories, like a certain snippet of a cartoon I watched when I was a kid, or a section of road I walked down once in recent months. It's always very detailed, specific and vivid, and I feel the exact flavour of the whole experience of that moment.
Whatever the memory, it always feels so familiar and just like yesterday that I feel """"""""Woah, I can't believe I ever forgot about that"""""""", but also I feel it's bizarre because it's the first time in my life I will have ever revisited this memory, so Im like """"""""How the hell did THAT memory come into my mind...how is it even still IN there..it's so tiny and random"""""""" I also often feel like I've just been thinking about it a second before in a more blurry, vague way, and that this flashback is it clarifying. Like when you start falling into a dream at night, then forget it, and then it comes back and you're like """"""""Oh yeah!""""""""

I wonder if anyone else has similar? Maybe it could give us a clue as to what is happening in the brain when we're ocd.

"HI
Some of you know that i dont have ocd, but my husband of nine years Marc does, he has pure ocd in the form of intrusive sexual images, and has to do a ritual to neutralise these thoughts. He also has a problem in the shower, he sometimes has to do several rituals in the shower to actually get out, and this causes him severe anxiety.
We went to see his psychologist last week and he actually opened up and told her that he has a few good days, then its starts to go downhill and he has two really bad weeks before it starts to get slowly better again.
He also started talking about numbers and times, and his psych and I both said at the same time 'magical thinking' which he has never had before - his psych doesnt challenge his rituals, and this is bugging me, as i think by not fighting it hes opening the floodgates of ocd hell - as last night he was complaining that his hands smelt differently and he was worried about things getting into the pores of his skin and sprayed it with computer keyboard cleaner.
This time last year he started going downhill and this resulted in a total breakdown, where he couldnt get out of bed and was suicidal for virtually 5 months.
i dont quite know what to do, i dont want to end up in the situation we were in earlier this year, and yes his meds Effexor has helped his mood, but it hasnt helped his ocd, and i think the psych doesnt seem to be applying any kind of cbt - she just asks him how he is and whats happened. He sees her every 6 weeks.
Any suggestions, advice would be really gratefully recieved.

"Hello,
I haven't posted for over a year as I had my OCD under control. I had been on meds for over a year and a half and started to reduce them in Feb. Everything was still under control when I came off the tablets completly in July but things started to change slowly. Only small things, like I started to doubt myself. For example I have a fear of shoes, incase they have blood on them from the street. When I get home I take them off and wash my hands straight away. While I was on meds I knew I hadn't touched anything between taking the shoes off and washing my hands, but after July I started doubting myself. Did I touch the bathroom handle?, did I touch the banister? even though I knew I had't I felt compelled to clean these things with anti bacterial wipes to wipe the blood I belive is there away. Get the picture???!!!!
Things like this now happen all the time, the doubting, the cleaing, the vicious circle. I have been back to my Psychologist and he is being very supportive. I hadn't seen him since April this year untill I went back to him two weeks ago. He had even written a letter to me to suggest I be discharged because I was doing so well.
I found out I was expecting my secound child in September, so think that the combination of morning sickness, feeling lowsy and tired, coming off my medication, being hormonal and having my son start school has all contributed to the OCD getting out of control.
When he was here at home with me we went out to music group, the local playgroup and kept busy. Now he is at school all day, I'm lonely and finding it hard to adjust to not having him here, so the cleaning and fretting now fill my days (untill Thurs/Fri when I go to work).
I feel guilty that I havn't been on here for so long. I was doing really well and should have been on here helping out people who had been where I was a few years ago. I really don't want to go back to how I was back then...a gibbering wreck, to scared to go outside or leave the safety of my duvet incase the blood got me. You may remember I had to go and live at my mums for three months because my husband couldn't cope with me and I was unable to care for my son who was two ad a half at the time.
Hope Legend, Flower Girl and my old friends are still here and doing well and maybe could give me some advise?

I was just wondering what people thought of the SSRI Fluoxetine?
This is my first try on OCD medication and ive been on a 20mg dose for about 2 1/2 weeks. Although it totally knocked me out in the afternoons, after abit of tweaking, my general mood and been able to deal with the OCD seemed great. However, the last 2 days ive felt like im in a bubble. Completley fatigued, headaches and just generally fed up! I spiked the other evening (first time in 2 weeks)and had a rough day yesterday.
How should i be feeling on this medication?
How do people feel on other SSRI's?
Thanks for any replys guys,

"Hello
I have recently started taking fluoxetine again at 40mg. I've took it before but have never felt this way before. This will be my second week of taking it again.
For the past two weeks I have been waking up with a dry mouth and feeling shaky and anxious. OCD has magnified....I can barely walk down the street without checking for syringes and constantly compulsively explaining myself and saying sorry, washing my hands a lot more.
I understand that when I get stressed OCD gets worse, but the physical effects are horrible. I've been sweating a lot more and I've been signed off for work as I came into work today and just couldn't concentrate and couldn't stop crying.
So I am not sure if it is the side effects of the medication or just having a rough time with the OCD like before. I spoke to the doctor who has said I can go back to 20mg or just ride it out on the 40mg....
Just wondering if anyone had any experience of medication doing this as I have been fine when I took all other SSRIs before....
Thanks

"Hi,
I saw my psychiatrist today and he wants me to change to fluoxetine. I am currently on 100mg sertraline and have been since March 2013. I have been on fluoxetine before but only for a few months when I was 16 and didnt really take it seriously and missed doses and never felt the full effects of it because of this but hopefully this time it will have an effect. Sertraline has helped my low mood but not my OCD, if anything my anxiety and OCD has got worse and my Dr said that high doses of fluoxetine are effective in treating anxiety and OCD. I know meds cannot stop you from actually carrying out rituals but surely they can help some of the wires in your brain that cause the OCD thinking? I have been feeling in a good mood but this is probably because my meds are working (for depression anyway) so no point stopping. I have googled fluoxetine and OCD/anxiety and seen positive reviews. I have been having bad night sweats for a while now and my Dr said its probably a side effect of my sertraline which I didnt even consider and thought it was a physical issue or anxiety. I have also been picking my skin compulsively and causing scabs and picking the scabs (known as dermatillomania, excoriation disorder, compulsive skin picking and skin picking disorder) and my Dr said that this is down to anxiety and hopefully fluoxetine will help this and my OCD and anxiety. Has anyone found fluoxetine (prozac) helpful in treating anxiety and depression? Are there any bad side effects?
I should be starting on 20mg and increasing to 40 and then finally 60mg (i think 80mg is the max)

"Hey everyone,
First of all I want to say a massive thankyou to all the wonderfully kind people that replied to my post (below). I appreciate all of your kind words and examples of your own experiences. I'm still ruminating on the subject evry day, what I did seems (at least to me) so much worse than what other people did, (for example, physically reprimanding my lovely dog probably on a daily basis, her not getting nearly enough walks- also when she went on walks she would get so far and stop- I don't know if she would not walk on because she was scared of the outdoors because she did not get enough walks or if was the burglary at my house that made her more fearful in general). I don't know if in my head I think it's worse than it is or if it is just factual that it is really bad. I feel I ruined my dogs life and made her overly submissive and fearful. I don't feel that I should be allowed to carry on as normal and have a happy life when my dog was denied this. I feel I should be punished in some way.
Can anyone recommend how I should move forward? Is there any reading material on how to accept bad things you did?
Thanks evryone

Hi,
I just wanted to ask for opinions, I beg you not be too harsh on me, I already don't like myself. I did some bad things and I don't knot how to accept what I did. Does anyone had any ideas about how to cope with guilt? Also, I am unsure if I have hyper-responsibility OCD, as I have spent the majority of the past month ruminating and analysing over and over again about the issue below (also on and off for the past couple of years) and I have vast experience of doing this with other themes . I'm not sure If I'm using the hyper-responsibility thing as an excuse to not feel so gulity. And when I don't feel guilty, I feel guilty about my lack of guilt.
A bit of info on my past- I have obsessively worried about my own short comings and suffered periods of depression since I was around 12- this is the first period of constant sadness and real low self worth that I can remember (I don't think I had much confidence before this age also). This has happended many times, and now I am in my mid 20's. I remember a period of being terrified of hurting a member of my family who I love more than anyone. It is only in the past year that my affliction has been diagnosed as OCD, since I have seen a therapist. My OCD ruminations went into overdrive a couple of years ago when a relationship ended. I would constantly think of all the things I did wrong, if I was abnormal and what was wrong with me, I would spend all day arguing against these negative thoughts. Not long after, my beloved dog of 17 years passed away.I feel like a complete hypocrite writing this as she deserved so, so much better.
The big 'hot topic' or theme- We got her (a Yorkshire Terrier) when I was around 7 or 8 years old and I always loved her very much. I was devastated when she died and still miss her. Throughout her life up until her being fairly old I would run around after her, tease and torment her (one incident I've been thinking of is a time when I flicked some playing cards in her face, I guess because I was bored and wanted to see what she would do or something). I would now and again chase her around with balloons because she was scared of them. Once I made it so she would hit/bump her head on a table because I suppose I thought it would be funny- it wasn't hard or anything and I dont think it would've hurt much really but I still hate myself for it, I flicked her ear a few times, would dress her up in dolls clothes. I would squeak her toys in her face to get her to play with me, I really hope it never hurt her ears but I guess I didn't really think about this or care about this at the time). I've tried to tell myself that loads of kids do stuff like that to their pets but I feel like I'm so evil for doing stuff like this.
Also when I was younger I would smack her probably on a daily basis(probably sometimes too hard I think) if she did something 'wrong' (like going to the toilet on the floor, or excessively barking at people through the window or at the gate), maybe I learned to do this as I saw my parents do it as a discipline technique. She would do something 'wrong', it wouldn't particularly bother me but sometimes I would choose to be the one to go and ''discipline' her by giving her a smack or shouting at her- I think I did it sometimes just to get out a bit of frustration, or to have a sense of be control I guess in a life where I didn't have much confidence and a lack of control. She always seemed submissive and would lower her head when you went to stroke her, she would assume sumissive body language (avoid eye contact, ears down etc) when you greeted her or went up to her. Even when she was being submissive I would still give her a smack when she did something perceived as 'wrong', again as a discipline thing- but she hadn't done anything particularly bad eg, barking through the window at people going past. Now I am older I now know that she was just being a dog and wasn't doing anything wrong. I cant live with myself that I caused her to be scared or unhappy for 17 years. I think that what I did was pretty bad and not many crimes would measure up in regards to the affect on another life.
I really really hope I am exaggerating the affect I had on my dog and I hope I by ruminating I am remembering it much worse than it was. I recall a time when I went to get her in from the porch where she was barking at passers by and I gave her a smack for barking, and my mum said """"""""she only gets her in so she can smack her"""""""". This memory makes me feel sick to my stomach. For my mum to say this I suppose I must've smacked her often for her to notice this.
She was a submissive dog, to think she lived in fear because of me makes me hate myself. I ruminate over what my dad said about the buglary at our home- that they must've kicked her or something- I think he must've noticed a difference in her afterwards (I was about 11 or 12 years old so can't really remember my dogs behaviour before the break in), I tell myself that if she was scared it was prob the burglary but I just go round and round eg- what if he can't remember clearly etc. I have spent so much time on the internet looking for info about submissive dogs and behaviour when I should be working. I worry that my boss will question me about this.
She would always be happy to see me when I got home, she'd be jumping around (although she did greet with submissive body language at first) and excited and she would run upstairs to sleep with me on my bed. I try to excuse my behaviour by telling myself that it was the break in that made her overly submissive but this just leads to more rumination.
I think around my later teens I matured and thought its cruel to do this sort of thing, I wouldn't smack her or particularly tease much. Maybe when I was younger I didn't realise it was wrong, I remember a few times someone or another would say 'aww you shouldn't do that its cruel' if I was chasing her around or teasing her. I didn't really take it in. I suppose I thought I'm loving her and don't think I'm hurting her. Also she didn't go for any where near enough walks, I suppose being young when we got her I didn't want to take on that responsibility and as I got older I just got used to it being that way. I've read that yorkshire terriers dont need much exercise and are happy to potter around the garden. I've been reading up on yorkshire terriers and dog behaviour to try to make myself feel better but I dont think I even deserve to feel better or have a clear conscience.
It sounds silly but I really did love her like a baby, I would come home from uni and couldnt wait to pick her up and stroke her and I hated leaving her when I had to go back to uni. She had to have an operation about a year before she passed away and I was so upset she might not make it, then when she did I stayed there with her and did what I could to make sure she was looked after and comfortable. I also keep thinking back to the time when we fist got her and she went for her vaccinations she let out a little squeal and for some reason I laughed. I dont know if I just thought it was a funny noise or something because I never liked to see her pain. Why would I laugh? I can only think that there is something quite wrong with me and I am not a nice person. Please tell me, how can I possibly make up for doing wrong to this innocent little soul? She is the happiest memories I have and I cant live with this guilt. To picture her little face makes me want to cry. To read about animal cruelty makes me so angry, so to think I did this- I don't know how to move past it or if I deserve to carry this around with me.

"Does anyone have this kind of problem regarding their OCD as I seem to. Sometimes when I eat certain foods usually elongated in shape I have intrusive sexual thoughts. I guess the obvious one would be a banana ie shaped like a penis. Now, I have a wife and have never had any desire for male sexual contact. The other day I was eating the last of a piece of toast which was elongated and again had an intrusive thought of oral sex.
I cannot believe how anxious this made me feel. Yes another day in OCD land. And yes its another anxiety spike, but as I said above, I wondered if anyone has experienced anything similar? This is obviously an intrusive thought, but it seems to have been given more power due to the physicality of the food.

"I go everyday living with guilt. I know its my ocd at many points, but sometimes, I am sure as many of you know, the pure o can mess with your sense of who you are, and who your ocd is. Let me explain.
Your thoughts are like this: an alter ego, who is not you, and is completely contrary to your beliefs, or values, or personality
You are this: :a1_cheesygrin: a kind chap (im trying to talk British, tell me how im doing) who has what they call a Cognitive Dissidence.
This means where you are here
here is your ocd. It is not you at all. Remind yourself you have a disorder, and would never really harm anyone. Use mental exposure, and deep breath. Set a time in they day to reflect on your thoughts, and when you have spikes during the day, tell yourself you'll worry about it at the appointed time.
I find it very useful to lay back, and give your worries to God. It is peaceful to lay your worries at Christ's feet, and I saw this recommended in more than one medical source actually. This especially for religious ocd sufferers, as I was once.

"First of all, greetings to all of you, I've read many of the threads on here and am impressed by the positive atmosphere. Now on to my post...
I decided to post this question here because even my psychiatrist who's the best in the region was unfamiliar with this symptom. I can remember having OCD as far back as primary (elementary) school and finally recognised it and sought help this year when depression also reared its ugly head. The diagnosed symptoms I experience are: I am scared I'll act on impulsive thoughts. I am obsessed with symmetry, especially in respect to my personal appearance and touching things. I have mental rituals I must complete to banish certain thoughts, though this only fends them off for a short period of time. I have an anxiety gnawing on the inside of my stomach 24/7. It takes me a long time to hand write because I must fix any percieved lack of symmetry or flaw in letter shape/ink density. I have a constant dialogue in my head, sometimes it's like listening to the radio or watching TV.
The symptom I wish to inquire about is a discomfort that seems to emanate from my forehead, compelling me to squint or cover my forehead with my hand. It worsens when I attempt to concentrate visually or write. Is anyone else familiar with this? I'm frustrated at the lack of information about it online or anywhere else.
Thanks for your time,
Nick.

"With lots of new members over the recent weeks I would just like to take the opportunity to welcome them, and I hope that you will gain support and knowledge from the forums. We have a lot of fantastic long standing regular forum users who offer some fab support and advice, so I am sure you will all benefit from the forums. Most of us on here have all been through it before with our OCD, and hopefully you can learn from both our mistakes and successes. Together we are here to help and support each other, together we will take power away from the OCD!
To help us maintain the forum we have a few guidelines which we would really appreciate wherever possible your help by adhering to our forum wishes.
Whilst anyone, regardless of location in the world, is welcome to use our forums, our website advice is predominately aimed at UK residents, and we adhere to UK treatment recommendations for OCD, and we do not necessarily endorse treatment used for OCD in other parts of the world.
Thread Bumping
Thankfully this is not a big problem, but it does happen from time to time. I know myself that when the anxiety is through the roof we become desperate for answers, and I do understand why people feel the need to bump their thread if nobody as answered. Thankfully we have a large user-base on here, so it is rare that posts go unanswered without anyone replying within a couple of hours, but sometimes it may take a few hours, even up to a day, for people to respond. So we ask you please avoid bumping your thread, and perhaps if the anxiety is surging take some time to focus on your breathing and try and take a step back to re-read your responses on your previous threads, often the answers are already there, but sometimes we just need to take that step back to see it.
Acronyms - HOCD, POCD, ROCD
Many other forums and websites are full of the use acronyms to refer to their type of OCD. It is worth noting that these acronyms have no official medical meaning, and actually lead to confusion over the type of OCD being referred to. In fact, one person once told us they had delayed seeking treatment because they were tying to find a ROCD specialist, when actually all they need is an OCD specialist. So as far as I am concerned, if it is delaying treatment the acronyms are a negative, not a positive thing. Also for some, the use of such acronyms is often a way of avoidance from actually referring to the 'fear', so OCD-UK do not recommend, or endorse the use of such acronyms. The confusion to other forum users is also a big problem, for example is ROCD relationship OCD, religious OCD, rumination OCD? Remember, the problem is not the actual H, R or P part, it is the OCD part, the initial letters (H, R, P) are just the 'flavour', therefore you don't have ROCD, POCD, HOCD, in fact you have OCD and it is helpful for you to remember that the problem is the obsessive way we deal with the thoughts. and sometimes it is forgotten by use of such acronyms where people think the flavour is the problem. So please avoid using such acronyms.
Txt Talk
An old favourite big bear amongst all forums, not just ours is Txt Talk. Because we are not Twitter, or a text message we are not limited to space, so where possible we ask that you please avoid using Txt Talk and letter abbreviations (u instead of you). Even though there isn't much use of text-talk on the forums these days, there has been more posts written in text creeping up around the forums. Text language is hard to read for many people, especially us oldies and perhaps also a tad unfair on overseas forum users whose first language is not English. So please refrain from using Txt Talk.
Posting External Links
When we set the forums and charity up, we took the decision that we want to ensure our users are given access to the better OCD resources, and therefore we have a policy of no external links (an external link is a link to a non OCD-UK website), especially to YouTube where some of the content is of an adult nature. By having a no links policy we also ensure that our users are not led to unreputable or inappropriate site that may be of an adult nature, or spam, or are simply people with a commercial interest in profiting from people with OCD, and yep, sadly those people do exist and have tried to promote their own services via our forums. There is the odd exception where the site contains an article by a respected OCD author where the content is not available through our own website, i.e. Penzel, Phillipson etc, but generally those links are only posted within threads to aid the poster. As a discussion forum, posting links to external sites also sort of defeats the purpose of a discussion forum, so external links should be used sparingly, or as a thread starter. So we please request that you do not post links to an external website.
I hope that this does not come across as fastidious, but after 10-years our forums still remain active and well used, so we hope that keeping our forums to a certain standard means we are doing something right and we will still be here helping and supporting each other in another 10 years time.

Thank you so much to you all for your help and support in respecting our forum.","['fear', 'Thought', 'interest', 'anxiety', 'anxiety', 'confusion', 'confusion', 'hope', 'Treatment', 'site', 'OCD']","['rumination', 'obsessive']","['rumination', 'anxiety', 'obsessive', 'OCD', 'site', 'interest', 'Treatment', 'fear', 'Thought', 'confusion', 'hope']",1.0,,,,
"The four steps tell us to refocus our thoughts, while, from what I've heard of CBT, it has us focus on them til we're desensitised to them and realise they're only thoughts. I'm fairly certain that, with a lot of the sorts of thoughts I have, even a person without OCD would not want to become de-sensitised to them, nor dwell on them with the idea that """"""""they're only thoughts"""""""", regardless of whether they're thinking about them in terms of themselves the way a person with OCD erroneously would. So far, however, I've found the four steps very helpful, but as I keep hearing the mantra of CBT over and over, I keep feeling like, """"""""Sorry, you can't really get well without dwelling on these horrible thoughts until you don't think they're horrible anymore,"""""""" which, frankly, I'd be disturbed if *anyone* got to the point where they thought some of my OCD thoughts were perfectly harmless, or at least, not disturbing (as I suppose thoughts themselves are technically harmless, which I guess is the idea).
In any case, redirecting, reattributing, refocusing and revaluing, while I suppose it could somehow be done in conjunction with CBT, sounds like a completely different theraputic method. It says right in the four steps (emphasis mine), """"""""With compulsive behaviours, simply observing the fifteen-minute rule with consistency and Refocusing on another behaviour will usually cause the Revalue step to kick in, which means realising that the feeling is not worth paying attention to and not taking it at face value, remembering that it's OCD and that it is caused by a medical problem."""""""" I find this works much better for me at the moment than trying to get to a point where, for example, thinking about doing something emotionally and morally repulsive to both myself and society is not in the least bit disturbing, but I'm just wondering if this supposedly constitutes some sort of avoidance mechanism on my part, since I read so much about how invaluable CBT has been for so many.

I have a pretty bad OCD theme surrounding kids. I hate it as it makes me hate life. It makes me believe that I don't deserve the love I get from my family and friends. One incident in particular makes me feel like this, as I keep getting flashbacks of it. Its the issue I keep raising where I made the conscious decision to move to sexually harm a kid intending harm etc. Now of course nothing happened, no contact was made, and that was because it was born purely out of a typical OCD panic striken situation.
I am haunted by this though, I am ashamed of losing control of my thoughts and actions, but as my therapist says and keeps well, shouting at me """"""""There would've been no arousal, no arousal no sin."""""""" granted had I made contact it would've been awful, but more so for me.
I have close friends who know about this and never treat me any different. I still get the love. I always worry about what strangers would think if they found out. But then, they are strangers so who cares. If everyone knew me like my mates then they'd probably have no issue either.
So what do I need to do? Turn off my conscience? I am not """"""""into"""""""" kids so why should I go round beating myself up over something that happened, or rather didn't happen (as in contact) a year ago?

"#####! #######!
It's been a month since I decided to go cold turkey and stop 98% of the rituals I do. The remaining few percent are the ones that take a few seconds and are so quick I don't realise that I did them until after I have done them.
Like an idiot I did this ritual for old times sake. It involves placing my feet in certain positions and taking a certain amount of steps when I go to the kitchen area upstairs at work. But I was never satisfied that I did it properly and it has gotten more complicated each time. I have been trying nearly all week but there is only a few times I can do this without drawing attention.
I went back to work yesterday because I have a key. I was extremely anxious during the ritual as I didn't want to **** it up. I thought I did it right then after quarter of a mile going home I had doubt about one of the stages. I could not remember how I did it!
I have spent 7 hours Friday lying on my bed trying to remember and trying to decide whether to do the ritual again. It has taken A CONSIDERABLE effort not to sneak into work today and have another try.
The conflict is this, do I carry on THINKING, WORRYING, BEING NAGGED by this for hours, days or try again and it might only take two minutes.

Relabel, Reattribute, Refocus, Revalue
Relabel - I know its OCD!
Reattribute - I know it is a fault with my brain!
Refocus - Doing another behaviour seems """"""""inappropiate"""""""" and doesn't stop the nagging!
Revalue - Not helping!
I wonder if it goes beyond OCD into bloody mindness. It's like trying to get off a level in a computer game that you used to be able to do. The more angry you get the more mistakes you make. I say """"""""I HAVE DONE THIS BEFORE. I CAN DO THIS!"""""""".
It's like my past rituals have lumped together into a super ritual.

"Things aren't going too well at the moment (sorry to complain - again! - I know things are much better than they could be ) but I am just stuck in a quagmire of anxiety. I won't go into details, because it's not really important and I'm not after reassurance and so on, but I keep catching myself furiously ruminating over it. But the thing with rumination is it's not unique to OCD - it's carried out by people with GAD and also people with no mental health problems at all! so how do I know what technique I should use? Do I approach it with ERP, the four steps, standard CBT techniques, or do I try to """"""""work it out""""""""like a normal person?

"Yesterday I was at a party and met girl, we started talking up close due to the loud music which meant me leaning into her to hear what she was saying. As we were chatting away I became aware that my body was in contact with one of her breasts which triggered off all the usual sexual assault thought patterns. I started to think that I wanted to purposely make contact with her breasts because I was angry with someone else I'd fallen out with, and by committing sexual assault it would be because of this other person. It was weird, like I'd taken responsibility away from the OCD and knew what I was doing was wrong, the urge was strong to do it and so I did, once, leaned in and made contact whilst thinking to myself that I was going through with this on purpose. I felt I enjoyed the contact although it wasn't physical, i.e. no arousal, just simply in the mind. Thought nothing of it at the time, until about 2 hours later when I began to feel seriously ashamed and guilty, now I feel like a monster. 
OK, so this has been a recurring theme of my OCD, I couldn't even hug my own Mum properly before she died because of the OCD thoughts about inappropriate contact, but I'm so guilty for what I did yesterday, even though it was bad, it was triggered by OCD in the first place and had I not had this godawful condition, I wouldn't have done it. 
Has anyone else ever acted on the thoughts or urges?

"I was chatting on msn last night to a gay friend. When he typed the word sexual, a little box came up with a video of a man ejaculating. it didn't turn me on. Later he made a comment that all women look the same to him. I said thats how i feel about men, within reason cos if i had to choose between brad pitt and a fat bald man with dribble coming out his mouth i would choose brad pitt. He took that to mean i fancied men which caused me to feel awful last night.
Someone managed to console me a little last night, but this morning there was a sex survey in a magazine about what men think of women. apparently 57% of men look at a naked womans breasts first. There was a picture of kelly brook. It made me spike again. I kept imagining being with a man, and part of me wanted to, it was exciting, the other felt awful
So far i have resisted cos a friend help me get through it last night, but i feel like i need to self harm again this morning.
Another thing, my psychoanalytic therapist said, im obsessed with finding a label to my condition and that i don't need to call it ocd. Hopefully when i see the syc on the 30th, he will call it what it is, ocd, and not pussy foot around the issue and not give me a 'label'
what is it about labels. why dont people like them. Its like if you have the 'flu' and not callin it the 'flu' because you shouldn't label yourself. its nonsense

"Hi
It seems like hand washing is the thing that lots of people know about OCD, most common thing
shown on tv when a character has OCD. It seems to me from using this forum that there are different reasons for excessive hand washing. I wonder whether it's different for everyone. My hand washing was the first (I think) OCD symptom and is concerned with germs. At first it was things like if I used the toilet I didn't like to touch the tap after washing my hands because it was dirty (touched by me and others with dirty hands before washing), so I would use my elbow (couldn't do that now) or eventually paper towels. Also I couldn't touch door handles and had to use my elbows, this was because people could have touched them with dirty hands. Dirty meant there were """"""""germs"""""""". I wasn't (am not) concerned about getting sick and I don't think that anything bad will happen. I simply can't bear """"""""germs"""""""" because there dirty. I know it doesn't really make sense but to me it does. I know a lot of people fear contracting some illness or making someone else ill but I don't worry about this. Also my germ problem ended up being quite focused on dog (not just dog) mess etc (avoiding it and dealing with any contact.). Sorry to go on so long. I would be interested in peoples views, comments etc.

"Hi,
I have had a really horrible time today.
I went to take my friends children to school which I do regularly, the oldest child has been off sick today so I have been looking after him. I noticed his dad's shoes were in the porch and had dog's mess on them. I tried not to worry about it but then the child told me (to be honest I did ask him) that his dad had worn them into the lounge before he noticed they were dirty. I started to feel quite paniccy (sorry can't spell) but I took my boots off made a cup of tea (trying to keep to the edges and looking for any obvious marks on the carpets) and sat down knowing that I was sitting where the person with the dirty shoes had probably sat.
I thought I was doing OK untill I realised I could smell dog's mess and it seemed to be on the carpet (although as the carpet is brown it's difficult to know where exactly) and possibly the sofa that I was sitting then I started to panic and ended up washing my hands with bleach twice and countless times wih hand gel. I now need to disinfect all my clothes (and the inside of my boots because my socks have been on the carpet) and bathe and wash my hair (after first spraying with disinfectant). I feel really shattered but when thats all done I will be OK.
Ok that is untill I go back to my friends house. So many things have been on the sofa and the carpet and I will to keep cleaning my hands and disinfecting my clothes afterwards.

"Hello,
I have been going through a particularly difficult time with my fear of contamination and germs for the past few months. I have a pretty lengthy history with this stuff but this is one of the most difficult periods because one of the infections/viruses I fear is actually in my home (my roommate has it) and I cannot escape it. I won't specify what particular condition this is, it may cause a spike for some if I did, but it is catching, remains infectious for a LONG time, and I'm wondering how I'm supposed to deal with this when the threat has become real?
When my fears were based on nothing but """"""""dirt and germs"""""""" that deep down I could convince myself were of no real harm, I was able to keep things under control - to a point. Now, not so much. My hand washing and need for complete clean has skyrocketed, and it's at a point where I hardly touch anything in my apartment that is not completely my own and untouched. Even just brushing my clothing against things has been causing a lot of distress.

But 1st... i have tried telling people how i did it before... and the odd 1 or 2 seemed to dought it, which is fine..... since then i have fully got rid of my OCD... well to be honest.. i purposley kept a little behind as its normal to have a 0.000001% OCD level. I have since used the same method to accomplish dreams and make my self happier....and it works....
I started looking more into my method.... and what i found was amazing.... its a scientific fact that my method was right and what shocked me most is how come hardly anyone knew this.
So before i tell you about the method and the facts why it can help every being on this earth.... ill tell you my story.... in short.... then will tell you how i got over it.... and how i started to look more into this method to realise that i had found an amazing FACT.
Well, in short... i grew up with OCD, its in my family, so can you imagine as a kid being told to check the door so many time by my parrent.... anyway.... at 11 years old.. i thought i cought HIV. from something i found on the street. I didnt get tested until i was 26... it was always in my mind..... i didnt want to touch anyone or anything. if i did... id wash my hands till they bled. then id cover my hands with plasters all over. id wash my cloths every day, id hoover every day... i couldnt even touch the wall in my own house without washing my hands after. i could shake peoples hands... i didnt leave the house and was stuck in the house for years. There is a lot more.... but to be really honest.... all the OCD habbits i did and how my mind was playing with me is not important... what is important.... is how i got rid of it in world record time....that even doctors were amazed.... Unfortunatly... its time for bed and i will continue this tommorow.
P.s. just remember one thing for now.... there is a scientific fact how to control all your thoughts and feelings... that you can keep the wanted ones.. and get rid of the ones you don't want....ITS A FACT.... how do i know.... because im an X SUFFEROR... not a sufferor. i have got rid of it... and am feeling sooooooooooooo goooooooooooood, and happy..... nothing can stop me..... have a good night sleep... if you dont... dont worry about it.... you will soon. night night all","['shock', 'cough', 'washing hands', 'Thought', 'OCD']",[],"['washing hands', 'shock', 'Thought', 'cough', 'OCD']",,1.0,,,

There have been moments where I feel well when I am alone at home, then I leave my house and feel a sudden set back of emotions and dread hit me. Momentarily its a shock to the system, and feel robbed that somehow I can be reduced to feeling bad in a few seconds. After experiencing this a number of times lately, I have slowly come to the relisation that maybe I am not as well as I think I am, and nothing has really changed. Hanging onto this notion, helps me put the illness back into perspective, I can be hard on myself, and lowering my expectations of what I can realistically achieve in recovery is what I should aim for.

Didn't have any proof to base this on, but it was a time when homosexual topics were very much in the news - Brokeback Mountain was on at the cinema, politicians were 'coming out', civil partnerships were being made legal etc. etc. Not really sure what kicked me off, but I seem to remember having a dream one night and waking up not really knowing what it had been about - probably because of what was in the news or the fact that we might have gone to bed watching 'Will & Grace' (which my girlfriend quite liked), I jumped to the conclusion that I must have had a dream about a homosexual experience - and now I was worried that I had enjoyed it! I found that all of a sudden I found that if I looked at another bloke (especially one I thought was gay) I would ask myself """"""""why did I look at them?"""""""", """"""""did I find them attractive?"""""""" etc. etc. Even had these thoughts about members of my own family and it didn't restrict itself to age or appearance, just the fact that they were male. Throughout this time, I never been aroused by images of blokes, still have a great sex life with my 'soon to be' wife and still find myself aroused by female porn (although I know this isn't necessaily healthy for OCD sufferrers).
Throughout my life I had displayed some of the normal OCD traits, constant checking of doors, the oven, light switches etc. and often felt the need to perform actions in a set way to ensure nothing bad would happen.
Previous to this experience however, I had never had another homosexual thought, always been attracted to women, when I watched porn it was female only - even the sight of a naked bloke would be a huge turn off. As far as I was concerned, my sexuality was never in question.
In reality, I still KNOW that my sexuality is not in question, but the pure hell of OCD is that just KNOWING is never enough. For the past 2 years I have been going through a cycle of feeling better, then getting hit by a spike and dropping back down to to the checking, searching for reassurance and surfing the net for answers - the problem is, the net is a wonderful thing, but there is so much out there that can actually make you feel worse, especially when it is written by people who do not understand OCD. Half the time I find an article that makes me feel worse - as an example, just the other day I read an article about people who had been married for many years, who suddenly decided they were homosexual (both men and women) - great, now all I worried about was """"""""is that going to be me?"""""""", even though I KNOW it will not be!
Did see a threapist for a few sessions and pointed towards OCD, but I didn't really have the time to take it further - always been very strong willed and like to think that I can beat this on my own.... even though it looks like it will be a long fight! I have even discussed it with my girlfriend, who to her credit has stood by me, but I try to shield her from the real torment of it and try not to let it show when I am suffering.
Well, thats probably enough for this post as most people will have fallen asleep reading the above. Just great to know that I am not alone and despite all the worrying thoughts, I know deep down who I really am! Just why does OCD keep raising the question?

"Sorry, my english is not quite ok but I will try.
I am 50 years old and suffering from ocd when I was??? 10 years old I think. I lasted till I was 25 years old, it went away but came back after a relation break up, 3 years ago. Well, it was a yes and no realtionship, it triggerd me a lot ("""""""" if you don't do this or that, you will hear from her NEVER again. So I did my rituals..).
I think it all started when I was a litte boy, severe education, hardly affection in the family and a very rigid catholic church education. Especcially doing sexual things (during your """"""""dicovering"""""""" age) were completely Not Done. """""""" If I was thinking of sexual phantasies I had to pray 20 to 30 times. That was the start. MY ocd was """"""""superstitious rituals, making afford to be lucky by making ritual doings.
After my break up I went in congnitive therapie for 2 years but it didn't serve me a lot.
Some months ago I made a radical change. In a shop I bought a Buddha statue in black and I REALLY liked it (yes REALLY..). I am a teacher in a primary school and after placing it at my desk I """""""" heard"""""""" : throw it away, otherwise some children will die in your classroom. It has a black colour and that doesn't look good""""""""
I was thinking and thinking WHAT to do, I brought it back to the shop, got my money back and.....the next day I bought it back, for the second time. It is still now at my desk.
WHAT made me change SO MUCH is the fact that I did something (buying) I liked very much and later, I spend a lot of time at the thoughts. I realised that WHEN you stay in the moment (buying statues, throwing things away simply because you don't need them, saying """""""" jesus"""""""" because you are angry at that time, ALL FEELS WELL.. That is your natural being, that is who you are. Thougths are coming afterwards (within nan seconds). Don't let you confuse by these thoughts and GO BACK to the thing you liked or did.t like (buing a statue, or throwing away a cupboard from your uncle).
It feels GREAT, doing so...and the thought won't devasted your lucky feeling.
Sorry about my english, I wanted to tell you this.
WHO has mede the same experience???

"Hello
I have a part time job at a supermarket doing 15 hours a week alongside going to college. When I went for interviews I mentioned that I'd had panic attacks in the past but that they didn't affect me anymore - I didn't as far as I can remember saying that I have severe OCD and depression (although my college know this as my attendance is shocking).
Things have taken a horrible dive recently as the main issue with OCD for me is contamination and I feel constantly nauseous which will spike a few times a day to the point where I am convinced I will be sick (my greatest fear, more scared of that than dying - stupid I know). Needless to say this comes with huge amounts of anxiety and the depression has been crippling as it comes with derealization and depersonalisation for me.
I would really like to be able to take time away from work but I don't think they would pay me as I haven't disclosed what I really have (started job 2011 was diagnosed in 2009/10) and I need to pay my bills! Being a young person (19) the managers are normally very condescending and patronising too. I'm also very concerned that they could fire me. I know it would be too late to disclose that I have OCD and then also say that I'm taking weeks off work! Argh this doesn't make much sense, sorry guys!
Any advice would be thoroughly welcomed as I am in the familiar territory known as living hell once again!!!

"Has anyone else found after making strides in their recovery there becomes a point where going forward is suddenly more daunting than before?
I've been feeling a bit stuck for a while now. I've made some significant gains in fighting OCD but now that things seems more normal than they were, going the next bit is really difficult. I'm trying to figure out why.
I think it has to do with being afraid of slipping back. I don't want to go back to 3 hours of rituals to get ready in the morning, hand washing until my back hurts and beyond, afraid to go to the toilet because of the rituals before and after, and really wishing at I wouldn't wake up because of the dread I'd feel after a few seconds.

"This was very nicely covered in Professor Paul's webinar and, as a subscriber to it, I am looking forward to seeing it again and taking some specific notes. 
It gave me the idea for this topic, something I have had in the back of my mind for some time. 
Therapist's experience in OCD various wildly - and it is wonderful that the charity OCD-UK is working hard to educate therapists specifically in the disorder. 
I was  fortunate - I could both get private treatment (initially through my firm's medical insurance), then paid for myself. 
But also my key therapist was a recoveree from my own theme of OCD - harm - and a dedicated devotee of Professor Paul's teachings. 
We are not served well by a health service that doesn't dedicate the necessary money to therapy for mental health problems. Obviously the lack of funding is a separate issue but also - as Paul said - offering 6 sessions of IAPT treatment to someone that needs a serious programme of up to 30 sessions is a serious lack in treatment. 
My initial encounter with therapy highlighted some of the problems the Professor - and many people posting on the forum - have discussed. The complete lack of a proposed structure to the therapy - the sufferer is launched into it effectively """"""""blindfolded"""""""". 
Also, therapists tend to be very forthright individuals, set in their ways - and I think one size absolutely doesn't fit all! 
Think of a football manager. The best ones are able to take the skill pool of the players they are given, tweak it, change the formation - and change failure into success. 
For me, therapists need to change their intended programme to suit the needs of the sufferer. 
By my first therapist I was told to enter into a two week programme of """"""""flooding"""""""" - constant exposure to my triggers. I was not given a say in this, so I took it anyway. I terminated the therapy, to the scandalised shock of the therapist. 
But I knew he was WRONG - a matter confirmed by subsequent therapists. 
I should not have had to take that action. It was bad therapy.

"I know the more positive posts dont always get many replies but I feel its important for all of us who are making progress to post about it, as when ocd was at its height something I foud helpful were the posts that said it can be done, I hope you agree.
I came back to the forum after a relapse a few weeks ago but tbh it had been getting worse for a good couple of years, an awful amount of stress had meant OCD had something to really grip to.
With the help of my husband who like most will get frustrated at times Ive got back to my 4 steps and taking st johns wort which ive found quietens the mind nicely alough makes me tired.
Well it got worse when I first started fighting back, it was a full on battle, crying more times than Id like to mention because it was so difficult, but I kept going, I went to bed several nights scared of something happening I couldnt control, but each morning I woke up and nothing had happened, each day I was able to do a little more 'testing' and get stronger. I noticed my anxiety ebbed away and I was able to move forward after a thought, not always, sometimes I found I missed the thoughts felt empty.
But each time I succummed I got back up the next day and started again, so far in 3/4 weeks Ive had 3 days of no ruminations, no worries and not redoing and action, Ive now started to confont these thoughts if it comes in which is does with no warning, I think right if i go with it ill be taking a step back, if I let it go and face it tomorrow Ill wake up feeling better and more positive, the feeling without OCD is so wonderful something that most people know and cant appreciate.
Its not over yet, I know it can come back, but Im going to keep going, reminding myself with these posts how it can be, and realising that its just a thought.

"Hey all, been a little while since my last post (I’ll count that as a good thing) and I was feeling a bit low so I just wanted to get it out of me a bit ?
To be honest, progress had been slow but steady and things are all round pretty good right now. I do get frequent waves of guilt and shame every now and then which can really dump on my mood and send me into a bit of a rumination, but I’m coping relatively okay with it. Mainly I’ve just amanaged to tackle the excessive loops of rumination, which has really done me a huge favour! I’m at a point with OCD that I’ve been at before. 
I’m relatively good at dealing with it but I still slip up and let it dominate me occasionally. I’ve also had the classic jump around between ‘obsessive’ topics, OCD’s attempt at keeping the fear fresh. So I guess I’m winning but the homestretch is long and gruelling. 
But yeah, things are going pretty well, kind of wish I didn’t feel so awful sometimes but that is just the way with the disorder. I get caught in loops of rumination but I’m much better at stopping myself than before. And to be quite honest, this time last month I was in a very sorry state, so I’ll take this over that any day!

A few times recently I have been in meetings and the anxiety has suddenly hit me full pelt and it makes it very difficult to do my best at work.

"Hello

I've been doing a lot of reading recently and have begun visiting two OCD support groups which I've found very instructive. Because of this better I understand the not-insignificant role OCD has played in my life since adolescence.


Because of this, I've been able to marginally reduce time wasted on rituals recently. But I want to take this further and 'break' the OCD. In doing that I am trying to formulate a suitable definition of the Theory A / Theory B paradigm suggested in the literature, that I am content with and accept, i.e. I'm 'trying to get my head around it' before I move on.


Therefore I would ask whether the following is a plausible explanation or not?


Theory A: The danger is real according to the OCD, i.e. 'My problem is that I have left the front door of the house unlocked. Because of this I need to repeatedly check that the door is locked'.


Theory B: The danger is imaginary because the OCD is skewing my perception causing anxiety and ritualising, i.e. 'My problem is that I worry that I might have left the front door of the house unlocked. Because of this I can stop or reduce the checking or other rituals'.


Any advice would be welcome.


Thanks

ive been put on the waiting list to see a psycologist about a week ago after visiting my gp for the first time about OCD ive had symptoms for years now just mild and very rarely strong enough to stop me living everyday life like normal.
bassicaly my symptoms have been getting worse and worse for the last 3 weeks or so now due to stress (family issues/money)
its come to a point now though where my OCD is the worst its been in my life and is getting worse rapidly its no longer stress causing it as mutch as the OCD itself is causing stress
im every door atleast 6 times before i leave the house ive had points where i get to the end of my street and even though i know ive locked my front door i give in and go and check.
im obsessed over self hygiene and take too long in the shower and im washing my hands way too mutch its come to the point now where the skin on my hands is raw cracked and even bleeding. even though i know its stupid i cant help doing it becuase the anxiety reaches a very high level this is just a few of the concerns i have i spend atleast 85% of my day worrying over things now which makes me repeatedly check things and is taking effect on my work.
i havent been told how long the waiting list is and i know it could be long.
i was told that if things get to bad to go to my gp again.
should i or am i over reacting its just that i feel i cant stop spiraling downards with my OCD its come to a point now where im sure im suffering from deppression too and the stress caused by the OCD is giving me really bad headaches too

"I have um-ed and ah-ed about posting this topic - it's been written in one form or another since Monday but I couldn't decide whether or not to post it.
My OCD is getting worse, almost by the day.
I've been coming off one of my anti-depressants, slowly, under supervision from my GP for 3 weeks now. I am due to stay on this dose for another week, then drop to an even lower dose for 4 weeks, then stop completely. I will still be on Paroxetine, just not Mirtazapine. My reasons for trying to come off the Mirtazapine are that 1) I still have severe OCD even with the meds and 2) I am sick of the side effects.
The last couple of weeks my mood has been lower, I have cried a couple of times (whereas I can't remember the last time I cried before that), I have started to have some """"""""dark thoughts"""""""" which I had been free of - they are related to the feeling of not being able to escape from / beat my OCD. My OCD has been bad for a while, but seems to be getting even worse, almost noticeably so every day.
On Sunday my number of OCD baths was in to double figures - that has NEVER happened before. On Monday after using the loo at work I felt contaminated. I couldn't face using it a second time at work (I barely drink anything so as to reduce the number of times I have to use the loo....but there's a lower limit even so) and so I initially asked if I could take an afternoon's flexi-leave, which my boss approved. I then asked if we could look into my working from home on bad days, which he has also been amenable to. I am lucky that I have such an understanding boss - I came home at lunchtime, did my rituals, worked, did more rituals, worked, and so on. In so doing I manage to work a full day, albeit only half a day actually in the office, the rest of the time I was doing """"""""offline"""""""" work that I uploaded when I was back in the office yesterday morning. I know that this is a form of avoidance but there was no way I could have stayed at work so this was the least bad alternative.
But my life is shrinking ever-smaller. My safe times are getting fewer and fewer. I am drinking barely anything during the day, and am getting the resultant headaches. I live in terror of becoming contaminated and go through goodness knows how many sets of clothes a day. I am going to start taking shower stuff and a change of clothes with me to work so that hopefully I can get through a whole day there. I am living in desperate hope of being able to access some specialist treatment soon. With Xmas coming we are supposed to be visiting my in-laws which I'm not sure I can get out of doing, and will be at least one night away, perhaps two. Hubby wants to stay at my parents' over Xmas but I am resisting because home is the only place I feel somewhat safe. I am washing and cleaning a ridiculous amount. I can't stop it. I wish that I could. But I am so sick of it. I desperately want, but more need, this treatment.
I am trying to get through one day at a time, but I am existing, not living.
I'm so sorry for this being such a depressed post. When I can focus on something, anything, other than OCD - whether that is cuddling the cats, or hubby, or work - then I feel better for a time. I am fighting to remain working but my workdays are getting more and more difficult, with OCD getting more and more intrusive.
My GP said to go back to him or one of his colleagues if my mood continued to drop, which it has done. He's on leave this week though and I would be reluctant to see one of the others as I have found that there are GPs who don't understand mental health problems. If my mood is still bad by Monday then I will ring and ask to speak to him. I am taking things a day at a time at the mo. I might have to look at taking sick leave from work even though I generally believe that work can help against OCD - if it gets to the point where I am exhausted from the OCD then some time off might help.","['Thought', 'drop', 'Rituals', 'office', 'hope', 'Treatment', 'OCD']",[],"['OCD', 'drop', 'office', 'Treatment', 'Thought', 'Rituals', 'hope']",,1.0,,,
"Hi everyone,
This is my first post on a forum of this kind, 1 month ago my girlfriend broke up with me and on friday I was told by a therapist that I have OCD.
My girlfriend broke up with me before earlier in the year about 2 months into the relationship and I was trying to understand my anxious behaviour when I was around her so I researched into OCD and I found it very relatable. After about a month my girlfriend wanted to get back with me and so we did but I still had a huge amount of anxiety over losing her again. I went to see a therapist at the time because I did not want to lose her due to OCD or anxiety. I explained my symptoms to the therapist but he said we are all very good at identifying ourselves with symptoms and labelling ourselves to have a certain illness or disorder, so he moved away from that and tried to teach me to be more assertive. After a few sessions I didn't feel like I was getting anywhere and no longer thought I had OCD.
My girlfriend moved away to university in September and whenever I went to visit her, most of the time I felt so tense and anxious that I tried to relieve them by performing rituals (mainly mental checking which can easily go unnoticed). 1 month ago my girlfriend broke up with me and I'm supposed to be a man but I was absolutely devastated so I have been crying a lot. With all this sadness and confusion I decided to go and see a different therapist, this time an accredited member with a specialism in OCD. I went to see him on friday and he has told me that I 100% am suffering from OCD. At first I felt relieved in that I knew what it was I had to treat. But now I feel incredibly confused about my relationship.
I don't know whether it was because of my OCD that I no longer have my girlfriend or whether it was the relationship. I told her that I was so scared of losing her when she went away that it was making me very anxious and causing me to worry all the time, but I didn't tell her that I had to carry out many rituals to make sure that I didn't mess up or lose her again, which was perhaps holding the anxiety in place.
Do I tell her now or very soon to explain myself before it's too late?
or
Wait until she returns home for christmas, by then I will be 4 weeks into treatment and probably understand myself a lot better?
She said she felt like we weren't as close as we use to be and OCD is very good at taking us away from the moment, making us seem more distant but I'm so confused about it all. Maybe it wouldn't have worked anyway or maybe it would?! I really miss her and loved being with her when I was relaxed, but I don't want to lose her due to some disorder that could've been explained!
Any advice would be greatly appreciated and I will try to help anyone I can on the other posts.

"Hi everyone.
Some of you might have seen my panicky thread regarding another OCD episode I've had being set off by me being drunk and not fully remembering what I'd done the night before.
This has been a reoccurring theme over the last 5 years and basically I've decided enough is enough and I want to stop drinking permanently.
I was hoping some of you who had had similar experiences might have some advice / helpful tips on what you founf worked for you. I don't drink very often but the problem I have is that my social group are big drinkers and I feel a lot of pressure. I also enjoy the actual taste and the fun you have at the time from drinking.
But, it causes so much grief for the days, weeks, and even months afterwards that it's just not worth it for me. In short, it's making me extremely miserable.
If anyone else wants to do the same thing but feels they need someone to support them through it and vice-versa, I'd really like to try that. Then we'd have someone to talk to that understood. Just an idea?
Anyway - anyone's experiences would be much appreciated.
I'm committed to doing it but I know it'll be tough at times.

"im getting close to leaving my husband weve been together 24 years and i love him wih all my heart,ive had ocd for as long as i can remember but now the theme has changed and i cant handle all the guilt i feel over a thought (although after nearly 4 months of rumination it feels so real)it keeps going over and over in my head and now im starting to worry in case it wasnt just a thought. ive made up such a story in my head that feels so true,my whole family would dissown me (I wouldnt blame them).Ive got nowhere to go,no-one in my family would understand,i cant ask for reassurance because that in itself could cause a whole lot of trouble.I honestly feel this one is the end for me i just dont want to go on like this anymore ,i cant i really cant, i feel like this ones too much to handle and if i am guilty for good reason meaning the thoughts real i dont want to carry on ,what do i do ?im sorry this is my first proper post for myself ive never had the courage to write on here before (apart from introducing myself twice before in 2 years) I just feel so alone.

"I have very severe ocd problems with comtamination of foreign bodies which I may pass on to somebody else, and that it could possibly cause them harm or even death if accidentally swallowed
My issue mainly revolves around glass, and my cleaner yesterday washed my glass fridge tray in the basin right next to my metal basket for the dishes, anyway I was just doing another ocd routine which I wish I never did as this is worse, my arm and dressing gown has brush over the metal basket really and there could possibly be glass on there, all my washing is away in the wash and I have given everything a good shake, would this bother a non ocd person and if there was glass would it be a problem
Sorry but I need to ask because I now find the rituals just as stressful, and do not want a shower and well yes I have actually got one change of cloth's but my dressing gown has been taken off and I put in on the chair already where I sit after shacking it because I just got a bit stressed with it all","['Rituals', 'OCD']",[],"['Rituals', 'OCD']",,1.0,,,
"Hello,
I know people have started this kind of thread before but was just wondering what things people have achieved this week?
& what goals you have set for the following week?
This week I've been mostly (I sound like the shed guy on the Fast Show) working on my contamination fears and done lots of little things like
- held a germy dog lead
- used a toothbrush that was in a 'dirty' cup for 5 days
- picked up things from my bedroom floor without washing my hands
- not washed my hair for a day
- put """"""""dirty"""""""" face cream on!
- not showered after feeling as though the toilet water may have splashed up at me!
- in CBT touched lots of door handles!
These are tiny achievements but it's still nice to make goals and meet them! I find my other OCD harder to tackle but am getting better at thinking 'So what!' and 'That's just OCD' and made some headway even with relationship, friendship and religious-based OCD!
What goals have other people made/met this week?

"Update my stag is now over I managed to forget the door handle issue for the night but sadly not the day I have unscrewed my old handle and I am ordering a new one and getting a joiner to fit it. My reason was my mum touched the wheelie bin and never washed her hands now when I stayed with her she unblocked toilets and dumped the toilet paper in a bag on top of of into the wheelie bin so I fear now if I touch my hands they are dirty and spreading germs. At work I worry I am making everything dirty. I worry my phone is dirty already after trying to touch the door without washing my hands. I bleached the door handle but this gave me no relief only replacing it does.

So anyway the update is I am seeking further CBT this Monday I managed to find funds to do it by making cut backs. I will see how I get on this time as this is my third time in therapy with this therapist. ","['fear', 'washing hands', 'toilet']",[],"['fear', 'toilet', 'washing hands']",,1.0,,,
"Hello!
I wish I could stop being scared of blood and then this OCD nightmare could end!
To me blood is dirty and I feel disgusting and dirty that it could be in my house. I am OK if I can see who it's come from ie if someone had a nose bleed in the street it wouldn't bother me, but if I saw blood on the pavement and could't see who it had come from I would go mad and think it was all over my shoes and it would contaminate the bottoms of my jeans, my car peddles, my doormat, my hands removing the shoes, the door handle to the bathroom, the sink from washing my hands, the towell, ect ect ect...see the problem?
Anyone got over a fear of blood that could give me some tips on how not to be so scared of it? I'm not scared of germs being in the house, or mud for example and they are """"""""dirty"""""""" too?
Got so frustrated earlier that I started banging my head against a door. I'm so tired all the time, my brain just won't slow down and stop thinking about blood....it's driving me mad!
My hubby won't let me go back on even a low dose of meds because I am pregnant, but feel like I am going to go crazy if I don't take something! My psyc is happy for me to go on a low dose, as he dosen't want me back to a quivering wreck again.
I was on a very high dose for about a year after my last """"""""manic episode"""""""" but came off meds completly, stayed """"""""normal"""""""" for 6 months, got pregnant and then started going down the slippery slope about two months ago:0(

"Anyone else feel like this:
Imagine like you’ve been counting numbers all day. Adding up, taking away, dividing and multiplying. Your head is scrammed. Imagine a wining child screaming in your ear “I want sweets! I want sweets!” Over and over until it becomes so unbearable that you give in.
Someone is pouring scalding water over your flesh and they will only stop if you give in and do what they are telling you to do.
Look around your room, look at the first thing you see. Say it’s a book.
Right, what is the title? Who is it by? Have you read it?
What is the last book you read, and the one before that and the one before that? What books do you have in your ‘to-be-read’ pile? What books have you studied for your course? What classics have you still not gotten round to reading?
Someone speaks. You have to repeat it in your head. You need a wee. You go upstairs and wee but you have to count how many pieces of toilet paper you use. What pants are you wearing? Oh those ones. Now you have to try and remember all the pants you own, all the pants you have owned. It’s pretty impossible but you MUST try!
It is almost like counting but it isn’t so much numbers but more like ticking THAT off the list and THAT off the list. It is never ending, as soon as one thing is over you have to do the next. It doesn’t stop. Everything around you is a trigger for another session of ‘going-over’ and it has become so normal you sometimes, almost, don’t even realise you are doing it. Almost.
It is always there. Always. Okay not always, not every single second, not seconds when you are high on life and ecstatic and happy and not moments where you are crushingly sad or bursting with anger, but it tries to invade these moments. To poison even the highest highs and lowest lows of life. It is like a disease infesting every corner of my brain and I am sick of it. Utterly and totally sick of it. I have always had two issues. My diary and my ‘going-over’ issue and I have tackled the diary. Now and again I think about it, or on days I think: ****! What was I doing last weekend? This time last week? Yesterday? But it is bearable and it isn’t taking over my life. Not like this. This is impossible to explain and to see because it cannot be seen, except for if you know me really well and you can see it in my eyes or in my tense muscles or twitching fingers. I would love to be able to make a cup of tea without trying to remember all the mugs I have owned, what ones smashed and how, why, when. To watch TV without having to replay the moments in my mind and the words said in case I missed some of it. To not know what plastic Tupperware containers are in the cupboard and which are in the fridge and freezer? To be able to go shopping without having an internal breakdown, but on the outside probably just looking a little bit stressed like I always do.
I am sick of this thing destroying my everyday life and it is about time I do something about it. I know, at the end of the day, only I can do something to stop it but I guess professional help may help…a psychologist who knows or at least somewhat understands where I am coming from, although I still feel so alien, so freakish and wonder if anyone else in the world does this too? How do I stop it when it is so ingrained in me and has been for so long? When it is like instinct, like breathing. Is it possible to stop? It must be. I cannot live like this. It is not fair on me, on my girlfriend, on my family and what friends I do have. It cannot and will not ruin my life and control me. I am sick of being controlled by my own brain and not being able to relax. I just want to be able to do things like normal people do but without it causing me such distress and starting the ongoing-never-ending rituals that happen inside my stupid little brain. I can do it, I will do it. I won’t let it beat me. I guess I have written this to explain what it is like, or try to, and how it is impacting my life and how much I want to get rid of it but how scared I am because it has always been there, not since 12 but that was when I noticed it wasn’t normal, not everyone did it. But if it has always been there then I don’t know any different and what it is like to be normal. No-one is normal but not many people can be as screwed up as this. What even is it? It doesn’t matter what it is I guess but it needs to be stopped. It won’t win. I won’t let it!

"So I booked my flights to go and live in London. It's 2 weeks away and I decided to just go for it, despite my fears. Where I am currently in Ireland is too isolated and in London I will be in catchment area of the Maudsley hospital who specialise in Ocd and anxiety disorders. So that could be a possibility. I will also not have to live with my family which is a huge source of stress, even though they are a big support.
I still worry that I won't get past this spike. I still can't see it as Ocd, although I am trying to treat it as such. Will I ever know why I kissed my brother again and let myself enjoy the arousal? Probably not. I spent months trying to figure out why I would let myself do that and never came to a conclusion. Thing is, now I have to live with the uncertainty of possibly doing something sexual with a child, and that is incredibly difficult. How does anyone live with that possibility? I know I have to but it's horrible and I don't know if I can do that forever. Any advice before I go to London?

"Hi
Normally when I undress I have to do a ritual where I take my pants off last so what I shall do now is beat the OCD ritual by taking my T shirt off then pants then socks to show that the rituals are meaningless. I was discussing this with a mod last night on chat. I have been feeling better today and want to enjoy the freedom of sleeping nude at night without ocd getting in the way. I have had a few of these blips before regarding this and they normally pass after a week or two. I have been doing exposure therapy lately and that has helped. So I shall now ignore the ocd rituals and I may get anxiety for a while but short term pain is a long term gain.
Not just this but on all other ocd thoughts as well.

"hey,
nice to be back!
ive just come back to london after 4 months away, first travelling, then spending a month in sweden with my girlfriend.
im now back for a month before going up to university in early october.... so this is a bit of a funny time for me... kinda in between things.
so perhaps thats why my ocd has spiked again...its been under control for a long time now... and i finished my therapy back in april feeling like i could cope pretty well.
now... the prospect of university without my girlfriend (who had moved back to sweden) just really scares me. its been a long time since i did academic work, and i feel daunted by being somewhere i dont know anyone.
my ocd has focused on my girlfriend at the moment.
i just cant stop myself have repetitive thoughts about whether i really want to be with her, whether its worth having a long distance relationship, whether i want another girlfriend etc etc...
now i know those actually sound like pretty rational concerns, but i also have decided that im going to give it a try... and that i love her so much.,... she's really great for me, and that she's worth doing long distance for.... and the thoughts wont stop!
also... i get obsessively worried about things like marrying her... wanting to have had a couple more girlfriends before im dead and stuff like that!... for gods sake ive only just turned 20!
i dont know... perhaps its not ALL ocd, but all i know is that i feel like absolute **** every day at the moment and i cant stop myself worrying and making myself feel horrible.
i came back here because my friends and family are a bit tired of my anxiety - and i thought you could empathise with the crazy self-destruction ive got myself into!
thanks a lot.

"I'm not sure if this forum requires trigger warnings? but anyone with Religious OCD, Superstitious OCD, Magical thinking should maybe avoid
Easy to say I feel rubbish right now, when I feel I've gone against my OCD, which in my eyes means """"""""Something really bad will happen to me the following year"""""""" I get a sudden rush of emotions, I feel anxious, scared, depressed and like I am about to cry 😞 it's a horrible feeling
So when I was sat outside today, enjoying the lovely weather, I heard my Neighbours phone going off, his ringtone is the Exorcist theme music which as you can imagine for someone with Superstitous, Magical thinking OCD can be a trigger. When I heard it I suddenly got a intrusive thought that if his ring tone stops as soon as my foot touches the floor, I can't play my computer games later tonight
'My OCD targets things I enjoy'
Naturally, his ring tone did stop as soon as my foot touched the floor, so I get this sudden wave of anger inside of me, my OCD depriving me yet again, this in turn leads to what I call 'Neutralising Rituals' ie my OCD says if I do this ritual I can in fact play my computer games later after all, as you can imagine it's not as simple as that though, it's ritual after ritual with my OCD rarely sticking to its part of the bargain.
I make the mistake of trying to research The Exorcist, looking for reassurance that it's all a made up story anyway and some demon is not going to magically make something horrible happen if I go against my OCD
Fast forward a hour and my OCD is now deciding I should avoid eating my dinner, as well as no computer games later, then it gets to that stage I sometimes get where my OCD is changing its mind every 5 minutes, 1 minute I can't have my dinner, then I can, then I can't etc etc etc, its SO difficult to know what the right decision is in these situations, sooooo I felt like I could eat my dinner, but as soon as I did I straight away felt like it was the wrong decision, and a sudden urge to burst into tears, along with crippling anxiety
I feel rubbish now and It's already leading to a huge spike in so called """"""""Neutralising"""""""" rituals to make up for my possible mistake, I know I shouldn't but I just feel so sad and horrible 😞

"Just wanted to share a bit of good news with you all. Some of my exposure for the last couple of months in CBT is to work on touching the bottom of the kitchen sink. At the start I was only able to manage to refrain from washing my hands for 3-4 minutes. I wasn't able to touch anything after doing it either.
Progressively I've been extending the exposure and today I managed to touch my face after touching the bottom of the kitchen sink, that was this morning and I have managed not to wash my face from the exposure. It's taken a long time but I'm really proud of my progress with this exposure. I think it shows that there is hope for OCD sufferers with CBT. When I started going to CBT I NEVER thought that I could do something like this. Really long way to go with my OCD yet but you've got to take pride in every small battle won!

"I've been on prozac for 2 weeks now (20mg a day) and just upped my dose to 40mg yesterday. But right now my personality has just gone to the dogs! I feel no emotions, no sense of humour, etc
My sex drive has disappeared and i just read on the net that another guy experienced the same for the whole time he was taking prozac. That's not to say it will happen to everyone but it is happening to me!
So i'm in a quandry, having just upped my dose i might stick it out for another two weeks when i'm due to see a mental health nurse about how i'm feeling.
But right now, i just feel lifeless with no personality whatsoever - just not interested in doing much at all. Music seems pointless too right now!
Anyone else experience this on medication? Do things get better?
I'm still washing my hands and have other OCD issues - pretty much to the same level albeit slightly better... i just seem less bothered by it. I just find i am less of a perfectionist, less anal too - which although often considered bad traits i would often benefit from them.
I must admit i am losing weight by the day and feel a lot better in that respect.

"I keep finding that I just write the same things here when I get a bad OCD. Most of the time when I get spiked by OCD, I am able to convince my self after a bit that it's OCD but occasionally I get these really bad ones that I get stuck on. I think it got bad because of nerves about taking a holiday and the nerves were worrying about getting bad OCD whilst on holiday. It started off with buying some jeans but it wasn't that strong. Whilst I was wearing these jeans, someone tried to break in to my car whilst was walking in this country park place and I got this thought that my jeans were cursed but thought thats an OCD thought and then I wore them another day and my laptop over heated and the keyboard stop working and also the sewing machine broke. I wore them yesterday and nothing happened but when things keep breaking like this, it just make it worse and feels less and less like OCD.
I am on holiday in Scotland and when I went to Edinburgh Festival, I got spiked really bad. I was sitting on step watching some Acrobats and I have OCD about things going wrong with my throat and breathing. Whilst sitting on this step, I swallowed and felt like my breathing might stop working unless I sit and swallow again on that step. I moved a bit but was still sitting and whilst I was sat there I felt like my breathing went funny and I got a bit scared and thought I have to move back to where I was sitting to make the breathing normal again and I did but it didn't feel right I also stood upo and then sat back down again because it didn't feel right. Everyone was leaving so I got up but I couldn't stop being worried all day and today. The reason feel more worried is because I felt my breathing do someothing strange. I know that this is hyper sensitivity but I don't feel convinced and keep thinking what if it's real? If it is that the end of my life etc. The reason this OCD is worse is because I can't go back to Edinburgh to sit back on that step because I live 500 miles away from there. If it had happened in my town I know I could easily go back there and because I know that the OCD would have no power over me. If that make sense.

"hey
This is brief outline of my condition to start my story
I am 22 year old Italian female,I have been with my boyfriend now for over 8 years.
This crazy OCD thing started about 3weeks ago & has been making my life a misery ever since. I was in bed & I change over channal, then there was this new tv show lip service about lesbians, anyway this 2 girls was getting it on, then the next day I had obsessive thoughts about 'what if thats me?' 'what if all these years I am secretly a lesbian?'
I should also mention I have never been attracted to women, always been crazy about boys, did the whole Nelly, Usher, posters on the walls when I was teenager, always had a boyfriend or interested in a guy. Infact the whole gay thing freaks me out, not to be rude to anyone but I always thought its not 'normal' to be that way.
Anyway, so 3 weeks have passed, still feeling ****, crying, stressing, worrying,'what if I am' 'I must be to keep having these thoughts' even to the point where my mind telling me I need to be with woman to be happy, but then me screaming back no no no!
Getting to point where i'm scared of being around my boyfriend, scared of not feeling attracted to him anymore,yet I love this guy so much, he's the love of my life, but this OCD thing is making me think my whole life has been a lie. I keep analysing past for any signs of 'doubt'.
I did suffer with anxiety & depression a while back, I had panic attacks & was scared to leave the house cos I was convinced there was something medically wrong with me, even though I had been to GP so many times to confirm there wasnt.
Sick of feeling this way, really sick. I want my old life back!
So went to GP today, absoultely awful visit, told him what I have, the crying, the depression, so what did he turn around and say to me?? 'an opinion may be you are repressing your sexuality' I was like what the
oh yes after 22 years of dating guys, being into guys, having a boyfriend for 8 years then suddenly oh I turn lesbian!!! DONT MAKE SENSE!
Also he said I DONT have ocd, cos I dont have ritual for it, he give the example of that 'if i dont tap the desk 3 times the whole building will blow up, cos ocd is about doing rituals not thoughts'
On the way home from the doctors crying, thinking 'GP is right, I must have repressed it for so many years' feeling awful, all I could think of was if I am that way I would rather die.
Is GP wrong? please tell me he is wrong!!!

For some experiences there may not be resultant distress or anxiety, the D (disorder)  may be more annoyance, resentment, or some other adverse emotion.
Generally speaking, OCD works the same way whatever the theme or manifestation. There may be a play on doubt and /or demand for certainty. And in some themes - like paedophile, faithfulness, sexual preference, harm - the OCD targets a true core character value and alleges the opposite has been may or could be true. 
Understanding how it works (C - the cognitive side)  is important. Using exposure and response prevention may not succeed in the absence of this. And we will likely find it difficult to not connect with, not give meaning to, an intrusion without this. 
When we do understand its way of working, and are using structured exposure and response prevention, leaving intrusions be and gently but firmly refocusing to something involved and beneficial - that for me is when we are likely to see progress in recovery.

Can I still do all the things a mum needs to, do I want to do all those things, do I just want to give up the kids and walk away :'( I can't handle this its all to much! Of course these thoughts are making my harm thoughts worse and making me think I'm more likely to act on them, and the lack of anxiety I'm feeling is adding fuel to the fire :'( I do feel very depressed about this and I do feel a little anxious and worried but not as much as I feel I should!! :'( what if these new thoughts are real because I'm very depressed and tired in my mind of fighting the harm thoughts that I don't want to be a mum no more and I do hurt my kids?? Its all just going around in my head and I feel so guilty and awful! What if I have genuinly become a bad person :'( how do I know these are all ocd based and not real??

"Apologies if this is a bit incoherent - had a general anaesthetic earlier today.
Hey, I'm sorry for the semi-frequent posting recently. Owing to a few big changes to my life, I've been exposed to my worst fears much more often than before. The main problem I have is distinguishing between real contamination threats and 'top-end' fake contamination threats caused by OCD.
I was in hospital earlier today to drain an abscess. I've already been having some worrying thoughts about contaminating other people with bacteria from the abscess (which was leaking yesterday), which I've been able to control more or less, but let's not get into that now. The REALLY worrying thing is this: when I used the bathroom in the hospital and was washing my hands, my hair gently brushed against the soap dispenser. Contamination alert!!! This didn't actually even bother me that much before I was discharged and got back home as the anaesthetic was making me feel very whoozy and I just didn't have the energy to worry, but now the anaesthetic has mostly worn off and I've thought about this some more...
It's the combination of the dirty appearance of the soap dispenser, the fact I was in a hospital ward and not a 'healthy' environment, and the fact I've been sweating a lot today which makes me feel like I've spread dangerous germs everywhere and there's still some left in my hair. I haven't washed my hair because I thought it would be good exposure, but now my anxiety is creeping back...
Really, really tired so I'll have to go to bed without washing my hair beforehand. I'll see how I feel about this tomorrow, but to be honest I might actually feel worse as the drugs wear off.","['fear', 'OCD', 'bathroom', 'washing hands', 'discharge', 'sweating', 'anger', 'anxiety', 'anxiety', 'abscess', 'Thought']",[],"['anxiety', 'washing hands', 'abscess', 'discharge', 'anger', 'fear', 'Thought', 'sweating', 'bathroom', 'OCD']",,1.0,,,
"First off, my name is Mike. I've joined this site to gain some insight into my OCD. I've never been formally diagnosed with OCD, due to the fact that I've tried my best to suppress it, but I'm 100% positive that I'm a sufferer. I suppose it would be easier for me to detail the 'types' of OCD that I suffer from, or at least the rituals I perform - to give you guys a better understanding. Even this paragraph that you've just read has been deleted and re-written several times, purely because I made one spelling mistake typing it.
The main OCD I suffer from is HOCD. This one's the killer, because it hit out from nowhere. I was about 17, and I was in a good relationship with a girl. We had sex regularly, and everything was awesome. But then one day, as I was walking to her house, a thought popped into my head. """"""""What if I'm gay?"""""""". I brushed the thought out of my head, able to ascertain that I wasn't gay. I'd never (and still haven't) taken any pleasure from the thought of sex or a relationship with a man. But, the thoughts have persisted for 5, nearly 6 years now, and it's beginning to tire me out. I have to constantly 'check' my sexual orientation, and no matter how disgusted I am at the idea of a same-sex relationship, I always end up checking again and again. Sure, there are times where it abates, and I can go about my life a bit happier, and surer of my attraction to women. But the one day I can wake up, and WHAM! it's back in full force. And it doesn't stop there. My head has a very stereotypical view of gay people. The women must be butch and manly, and the men flamboyant and high-pitched. I don't know why, but that's how my head perceives it to be.
Now, I don't a high voice. I have a decent tone of voice for a male of 21 years of age. But sometimes when I talk, my head catches the odd word and thinks """"""""****! That sounded a bit effeminate!"""""""" which in turn causes me to worry. And sometimes, I'll find myself sitting in a certain position, which I see many straight men sitting in. But, if I see a gay man doing it, it worries me. It's ridiculous.
It also spans into my music taste and hobbies. I've listened to heavy metal since I was thirteen. I don't enjoy any other type of music. But a good portion of the time, my head doubts that it's what I really enjoy. It's a pretty 'manly' genre, not usually associated with homosexuality, right? Having this stereotypical view of gay people, my head reckons that they like upbeat pop, not down-tuned guitars and screamed vocals. I think my head tries to convince me that I don't like it because 'I could be gay and that's not what gay people like'. But then 15 minutes later, I could hear a riff and be head-banging like crazy, having a whale of a time. It's **** this illness.
Then, there's a sort of """"""""social-interaction"""""""" OCD. I've never been a social person. I prefer my own space, y'know? As a kid, I was always in my room, doing my own thing. I like being alone. If I could, I'd spend all day and night alone, happy as Larry. But sometimes, my head tells me that that too is not who I am. It tells me that I want to be part of a big group. So, I did an experiment. I called up a friend, and he called up a few of his. I ventured out, to hang with them. I didn't enjoy it. All I could think about was leaving to go back to my room, and be alone. But then, the next day, my head told me again that I wanted to be with people. Which is obviously not the case. I don't understand that when I'm typing all of this I can feel 'normal'. Like myself. The straight, loner kind of guy. But tomorrow or whenever, my head will cause me to worry again - and I'll not know who I am. Can anyone help?","['site', 'Rituals', 'disgust', 'checking', 'joy', 'Thought', 'OCD']",[],"['site', 'disgust', 'checking', 'Rituals', 'joy', 'Thought', 'OCD']",,1.0,,,
"Hello All,
This post does contain some personal details, I hope I have not been too graphic.
I am currently undergoing CBT for various themes, including if I am attracted to children. Past events are a big problem for me, today I have been struggling with events from what I would call the 'grey area' of growing up and puberty etc. When I was at High school / secondary school and I noticed girls going through puberty, I started to 'notice them' as I also went through this change. This led to things such as masturbation which I suppose is normal( this happened occasionally in school as well as at home.. However looking back I worry as these girls if they were in high school would have been underage, this means I did this act over underage girls. I also can't be entirely sure that I got it wrong and they had not gone through puberty.
I also worry about an incident where I was staying over at friends house and slept on his sofa, also there were 2 younger girls who I was attracted to, I was probably about 18 or 19 and they could have been 15/16 I can't be sure. Nothing happened but I know if they would have shown 'interest' it probably would have . I can't remember clearly enough I am 38 so this was around 20 years ago.
My concern is that this means I am what I fear, a pedophile. Am I alone in having such experiences?. I would appreciate some advice as I am struggling big time with this one.

"Hi,
I've had some success with therapy in the past, but I still find ocd very restricting - especially as it has been bad lately . Tomorrow I've got a group therapy session and I'm a little bit excited, also nervous. I've never done anything like this before - just wondered if anyone can tell me what to expect? I know the therapist and I am sort of looking forward to meeting some other people with ocd, although I'm not sure if this will worsen the situation by getting tied up in their ocd's as well :huh:. But then I suppose I could say the same about this board, but that hasn't been the case.
Yesterday, I woke up and actually had a positive attitude to beating ocd (for once) even though I still did a lot of the rituals. However, today I have been far more negative and bogged down in all the thoughts. It's just annoying me so much I really want to fight back, but not sure if I have the strength.

"Hi all,
I have posted on here a few times over the past few weeks about worries over my relationship with my wife. This has been brought on by a crush I have on a woman at work. This has waxed and waned over the last few weeks. At it's peak it led me to have my medication dosage increased due to the anxiety it was causing me. However something happened today which has re-ignited my OCD in a big way.
I was talking to a colleague today who I have a  'laddish' type relationship with and this woman came up to speak to us both, it's an odd dynamic as this guy knows her better than me and has a more 'banter' with her, when I speak to her, just the 2 of us its a bit more polite and quite surface chat but when it's 3 of us the dynamic changes. This guy and her have quite a 'banterish' relationship and she is a different person when conversing with this guy than with me. I feel shy of her anyway and even more shy when its us 3. I can be jokey etc with other men but struggle to relax when women are around.
. Anyway she said during the conversation that she prefers me to this other guy. I think she was referring to my personality as i tend to be a bit nicer where as he tends to wind her up a bit in a jokey sort of way, i also suspect this was her trying to wind him up a bit as she responds in a similar way to him.
My rumination has gone into overdrive over her comment about liking me more, i wonder if there was maybe a bit more to it than just my personality, does she like me in that way? this made me worry as i suppose i do like the thought of her liking me but feel guilty for this as i am married with a child. Why would i want her to like me if i am married? surely this makes me a bad husband for having that take on things, surely i would not be bothered if i truly cared about my wife?
I also feel a lot of guilt for having this debate in my mind as i know my wife would be hurt and upset if she knew  and i feel i am almost cheating on her in a way. If i am honest in other circumstances i may like to try and develop a closer relationship with this woman but i don't want to jeopardise my marriage over it. Also this woman is quite a lot younger than me , i am 38 and she is early 20's (i don't know her exact age) this adds to me worry as i have concerns over if i am attracted to children and this age gap plays into this theme too.
the doubt over my relationship and if a love my wife causes me much distress and i don't want to get dragged back to the place i was a few weeks ago.  
  I would appreciate some guidance on this.
Thank you","['Medication', 'anxiety', 'anxiety', 'OCD', 'talking', 'Thought', 'guilt']","['rumination', 'theme']","['rumination', 'talking', 'anxiety', 'Thought', 'theme', 'Medication', 'OCD', 'guilt']",1.0,,,,
"Hello, guys! I remember myself suffering from OCD since I was 14 (now I am 27), but I think it started earlier, I just didn't understand that yet. It was quite a hard experience for me as I didn't know about this disorder at all, so I was thinking I was just going crazy day by day. I didn't tell anyone about my condition and my fears, so it was a huge everyday stress that was making my OCD only harder. After some years I've got to know about OCD from some movie on TV and I told my boyfriend that I have the same thing. I was so relieved by telling someone about my rituals and other things and by knowing that I am not the only one in this word with this disorder and it even has a name. So I started to treat it with doctors and without them, I've tried a lot of methods and I am happy to say that now I feel free from OCD. There appear some symptoms when I get stressed or tired but they are very easy to cope! As I was struggling with OCD for many years and I know how hard it can be, I feel all the people with OCD as my sisters and brothers, so I really wanted to be helpful and decided to write a guide of self-help for people with OCD and also for their relatives/friends. Here is the link for this guide: https://www.solutionbay.com/solutions/obsessivecompulsive-disorder-ocd. I really need your feedback, so I will know if it's helpful or if I need to change something. I really hope that it will help some of you as I tried almost all of the methods described in the guide on myself and finally, they worked somehow. I hug you all and wait for your comments!

"A few times at work I tried to get rid off the responsibility for a few things. E.g. if the kids wanted to play alone together or were in the same room when they undressed themselves etc I had the thougt that maybe something inappropriate could happen (some kids made bad experiences at home) but still let them be on their own. I don't know why, I think I didn't want to have the responsibility althoug I know that they cannot save themselves. Today a colleague told me that I boy put his penis in front of the face of another boy while they played alone (a colleague was at work, not me) and that's why I feel guilty now. I mean the colleague also left them alone and maybe I just had the thougt because of somethingsexual and my ocd theme etc... I don't know what my exact fear now is? Maybe I liked the thougt that they could do some sexual acts when they are left alone? But I didn't enjoy the story of the boys doing that? I just don't know.

"Hi, All
Happy New Year to you all! I've just had a horrible spike, the first in a while, and it's really thrown me back into this state of thinking, """"""""This isn't OCD, I have every reason to be feeling this guilty! How could I have forgotten?!"""""""" You know, the thing where you feel like you are in denial for NOT engaging with the thoughts. (Mine are mostly intrusive memories.)
Anyway. I know this is all part of it. But when you are in the throes of an OCD panic it's CRAZY hard to have self-compassion and objectivity. Well I think I find it so tough anyway, because mine is all about feeling that what I have done in the past is dreadful. And this feeling that MY OCD is different because it's based on real things.
So I'm thinking about ERP, but I've felt worried by hearing some people's experiences where it has made things worse, or that the anxiety has risen but not come down again. I just could not cope with that. Really really, couldn't cope. So I wondered if anyone had any thoughts or experiences with ERP when it comes to crippling guilt?

"Hi everyone, It's been 3 years now since I posted on here,and 3 years since I've visited the site. I stupidly thought,well didn't think but things seemed to be OK for me in my life and Ocd had become something that I'd just had in the past,and I guess was just residing in my brain a bit like a very quiet lodger. I'm surprised it has stayed away fro so long,considering that last year was the year from hell,with many family illnesses and events,the main one being that I nearly lost my dad to cancer. All of these events I coped with so very well and still managed to run the family home and work as normally as one could. However the last week or so has been an absolute living hell for me,when the holiday of a lifetime with my family in the US,when I should've been my happiest hasn't exactly turned out that way. The old thoughts have come back,with the problem being that I always have one particular thought that grips me with so much anxiety. I know it is rumination to the extreme and that I'm sure I was actually having some panic attacks. This has continued now I'm back and the one thought/fear of being very inappropriate on holiday,involving a child left alone by its mum,has now snowballed into another fear when I took my daughter swimming yesterday,it is the fear and guilt that is killing me,I think I need to go back on sertraline just to calm my anxiety,because at the moment I cannot function or sleep very well.

OCD keeps saying things like """"""""you've done something wrong, you're a bad person, you have to make up for it (by washing my hands, I know it doesn't make sense), or you're a terrible and worthless human being,"""""""" for example.

I feel all sick and evil, like the police will come take me away at any moment. Logically, I know that I've done nothing wrong, and that no one's going to arrest me because I didn't wash my hands enough.Yet I am still alert, listening for sirens.

"In te last couple of years a lot of different Ocd themes have come by. But all of them have been related to guilty subjects. And now a new one has raised which I cannot seem to shake off. Almost 3 years ago my stepmother past away due to cancer. She had been fighting the disease for about 2 years before passing away.
Now somehow I started getting thoughts that maybe I sort of took advantage of that situation by taking days of work because of her sickness. I would tell my boss I wanted to be with my family to support them while in reality I have only been there to support them for a small amount of time that I got free from work. I mostly just was playing games at home. And now I feel so incredibly guilty for doing that while my stepmother was ill.
I feel like as if I abused her sickness for my own good.
Also during her illness I sort of felt good talking about her sickness at work and towards friends. I guess I liked the attention??
That's something that also is bothering me a lot.
I really don't know what to do. And I feel as if like I should confess towards my wife, my father, my brother, my stepbrothers and others.
Am I worth living while using others passing away for my own good?

"I know this post falls within the realm of reassurance seeking but I really need some help here.I need views of other people on this.I cant understand how to handle it.

I have had OCD now for about 15 years and have been on medication for quiet some time and also therapy.My last theme was remembering that some years back while driving I had heard some loud noise close to my car but I had not stopped to check what it was and now it made me think that there was an accident and did not check properly for what had happened.This gave rise to the thoughts of me being a bad human being and having done bad things in life.This was the first time I was facing a situation where the thoughts had a link to an event and there were constant 'what if's' of could this have happened or that.

But as soon as my last theme got a little weaker my brain has been scanning for events in my past which will show that I am a bad person.This scanning made me remember that about 12-13 years back I was driving a motor bike and I had collided with another motor bike driver at moderate speed of about 40 km/hr due to my mistake and we both had fallen down and the other driver had seemed to hurt his foot.It was a busy street and lots of people had gathered and I took the person on my bike to the nearest hospital ( I feel I wouldn't have if so many people had not gathered).After getting him there I just left from there as perhaps I was scared to get involved with police etc. I did not stay back to check how he was or pay for his medical expenses. I avoided that area for few days lest police was looking for me.Guilt is not because I caused the accident but because I did not take responsibility for it.I don't remember thinking about it much then.Remembering that incident now has resulted in a severe back lash.I feel that now I have concrete proof that I am a bad person.My entire day is consumed by these thoughts of guilt and how do I make good this mistake which I had done.I am on this for more than 9 months now.
I understand that what I did was not right and I am not proud of it.The brain refuses to believe that this is OCD since it is a real event.

"Hi everyone,
I feel guilty over lots of things (this possibly doesn’t relate to OCD as I’m pretty sure most people feel guilt to some extent!). Anyway, one theme of my guilt is around plagiarism- uni was a bit of a nightmare! I still worry about it to this day (eg at work, although not to the same extent as deep down I know people won’t care if I re-use someone’s phrase in an email). 
Anyway, I tend to go through phases of worrying about different things, as opposed to caring about everything all at once. It tends to be more likely to happen when I ‘should’ be happy/have a lot of free time- ie bank holiday weekend! 
Todays worry is something that happened in school when doing my alevels (for context I’m now 30). We were doing some controlled course work (ie test conditions) for Chemistry a level and, as usual, I was struggling. I’m pretty sure it was because I didn’t listen to the instructions properly. Anyway, I came  to a question I couldn’t do and it was probably worth quite a few marks. I started looking around me and saw how another student had answered (ie the method they had used), which I then started to apply myself. I think I then put my hand up and told the teacher I was stuck however when they saw what I had done (ie the method I was using) confirmed that this was right. 
Obviously I know this was wrong, hence why I still sometimes ruminate on it. And I know I was definitely against cheating so don’t know why my panic got the better of me. I didn’t do amazingly well at my a levels but did manage to get into a good uni, which has been a springboard for all other achievements in my life. I feel so guilty that I don’t deserve any of this. I have a relatively well paid job and live such a privileged life but I haven’t earned any of it. What if I was borderline and only got the grade I did because I looked at someone else’s work? I want to make things right but I will look crazy if I confess to someone now. And who to? My old school? The exam board? Admissions at my uni?

"I had an assessment today for CBT. The appointment lasted 1hr 40 mins (!) but I still don't think I got my point of view across very well.
Although I have contamination/washing OCD, my doctor had refered me because I was worrying excessively about cancer etc. and going to the doctors frequently in order to get reassurance. (The hand-washing, while being annoying and something that could be worked on further, is not the major issue for me at the moment.)
So anyway, there I was during the appointment. The nurse hadn't had a chance to read my notes as they only came through this morning. He seemed to dwell an awful lot on the hand washing side of it all. I tried to point out that it causes only moderate disruption to my life and it was the health-related anxiety and subsequent trips to the doc that was the issue, but I'm not sure he got it. I suppose to be fair, he did make copious notes and listened when I told him about the anxiety stuff, but I guess I'm concerned that the focus of my treatment won't be on the issue that's causing most distress.
So far I've been a bit of a devotee of the four steps, so don't know whether CBT would be much use to me anyway (I mean, what's the point of touching the toilet bowl and then eating a pack of crisps like they did in The OCD House? Non-OCD people don't behave like that, so why should I have to do it? No offence to the docs/participants on The OCD House or people who find CBT helpful - I'm just doubtful that it's for me.)
I have to go back next week to find out the result of the assessment.
Sorry to gabble on - feel better for getting it off my chest. Would be interested to hear how others have got on. This is the first time I've been referred to the hospital mental health team so I guess I'm a bit scared - don't know quite what to expect.","['Treatment', 'toilet', 'interest', 'anxiety', 'anxiety', 'OCD']",['excessive'],"['anxiety', 'interest', 'Treatment', 'toilet', 'excessive', 'OCD']",,1.0,,,

I am still doing ok, trying hard not to let ocd have a go, and progress is still very good
Anyway, I got to thinking, does anyone else have a contamination fear of cleaning products??

I can quite honestly say i am more scared now of bleaches and cleaning products, than i am of germs, which is bizarre lol when i clean the bath or sink, i rinse it many times just to make sure all of the product is off, i am now spending time when i clean wondering if i've left any harmful chemicals lying around!!
I know in essence it is exactly the same as being worried about germs, but i just find it funny that i can go from washing my hands with kitchen antibac wipes IN PREPARATION to wash them with red hot water and antibac soap, to then being freaked out about the very stuff i used to rely on........... i tell you ocd is blooming wierd!

"Hello again!
Its murphy's law, right when i posted that im doing better, some issues came up. I am handling them better then before, but still the mind grinding...aw...
So i want to ask a question, cause i couldnt resist searching the internet about this and i wanted to ask you guys, due to all the OCD doubting you can relate to.
Do people speak the truth when they are half awake/asleep?
My partner said something about FB and sex chatting i guess, which i never was a part of.
Im a bit concerned, cause a day before i found this weird post from a girl on his wall that may be described as her visiting his house.
I havent found the right time to simple ask him, cause i think that the FB comment from the girl is something any normal person would be concerned of. As for the sleep talking, well seriously if it wasnt for the post the day before...well i dont know.
Good thing is im not panicing about it, bad thing is im so tired of asking him stuff and putting us through those situations that im even afraid to simple ask him about a sort of logical reason and i honestly dont know how to ask.
I have a couple of months or more to ask him about stuff like this.
What do you think?Has this ever happened to you? The half asleep talking part.
Most people say that the truth is told when you are half asleep, but what if he said """"""""hand me my red dinosaur?""""""""
I can see the reasonble explanation, yet combining the two events (FB wall-sleep), i can't shake it off completley.
Also, would love some tips about how should i approach him as a non-freaky-jelalous GF.
Thanks in advance!
edit: i have resisted to log on his FB account, i am proud of that! But sometimes im tempted cause i think that w/e he tells me i will not believe him, so i find it reasonable to go snooping. I know that it will make it all worse though. I dont mind finding something, i have a long time to get this kind of spike, (as mild as it is) and seriously, sometimes i think """"""""better to find out he's cheating, to be done with""""""""
Hope i wont snoop and keep it clean!

"Hello,
New member here. I am a male in my late 20s and I have dealt with OCD for several years. My complusions and rituals mainly revolve around germs, bacteria and contamination. The main issue is I can't seem to convince myself that washing my hands once properly with an antibacterial handwash is 'good enough'. As a result I end up washing my hands several times (usually a maximum of 3 times in one handwashing session) in order to feel clean. I have to scrub my hands for around 30 to 40 seconds in stages - twice with antibacterial washing up liquid and finally finishing up with a regular antibacterial handwash.
I want to stop and reduce it to a single, thorough handwash. But I can't seem to convince my mind that once is enough. I've looked at NHS/hospital handwashing guidelines in an attempt to convince myself that a single wash is enough, yet I just seem to hit a roadblock in my mind. I always end up feeling that a single wash won't remove all of the bad bacteria from my hands - and the only way to do so is to wash them several more times to ensure any 'leftover bacteria' is removed.
That's the kind of logic which my mind operates on and it's incredibly hard to counter. This problem is really costing me financially as I am spending more on antibacterial liquids/handwash and more on gas as I leave the hot water running whilst going through several scrubbing routines.
What I want to know is will washing my hands more than once in a single session make them any cleaner? If I scrub my hands well once for 30 to 40 seconds will that be really enough to remove all the bad bacteria? I just find it so hard to defeat the logic in my mind that tells me that washing several times is better than washing once because more washes ensures any leftover bad bacteria is removed.
I also end up think about the way surgeons scrub up several times before surgery and my mind uses it to convince me that there is a purpose to washing my hands multiple times.
How can I overcome this thought process? Is washing my hands more than once in the same session utterly pointless?
Any input will be appreciated.
Thanks.

"So, uhh, normally I don't really have this extreme thing. But today (I work with kids, like I've mentioned before), a little girl peed herself, which, well, that happens. While I was cleaning up I first couldn't find gloves, which lead to me undressing her without. As if this wasn't bad enough, my brain suddenly gave me this disgusting image and I suddenly felt totally panicky and disgusted by my own mind and I started washing my hands. And everytime I think about it, I wash them again or feel the strong urge to wash and disinfect them. My hands are red and very dry by now.
And since ,well, some time, I've been panicking over knives because the thought popped up of stabbing myself. I've been avoiding knives ever since and it's getting worse and worse. I can't even look at one any more.

But anyway, what I want to ask is is it normal for a guy not to wash their hands after they have done stuff (you know what I mean)? Only my boyfriend will do that and then will touch the doors, go and put the kettle on, etc, etc, before washing his hands. I have to tell him to wash his hands or he won't wash them for a while. What's normal? Is he just dirty or do most men not wash straight after?

"So I suffer from contamination ocd mainly. A few years ago i was very very bad, washing my hands 10s - 100s of times per day, after taking citalopram and doing CBT it has gotten much better and for the most part it isnt even a problem anymore save for a few flare ups every now and then.
But there are still certain things that will set me off into repeated handwashing mode, namely raw meat and poop, which is a b**tch considering i have to look after 2 dogs most days and pick up after them when i do. Ive been trying as hard as i possibly can when i have to encounter these thing to wash my hands only once and then walk away from the sink, but try as i might i just can never shake the feeling that i havent got the germs off my skin and usually end up coming back for a second and sometimes third wash just to get the monkey off my back.
I guess im just wanting reassurance from people that one wash is enough in these situations, like if you get actual poop on your skin or something will one lather and rinse really get your hands free of germs? Same for handling things like raw chicken and pork? For how long do you scrub? What do you do in these situations.
Sorry if this is triggering to anyone, I just want to hear other peoples take on this as mine is obviously wrong and i know it, but still cant get rid of this horrible nagging thought that im gonna make myself sick from not washing enough.

I've suffered from OCD now for about 17 years. A very up and down time but since hitting 20 been very hard. All i will say is i'm between 25 and 30 ! I started off worrying about CD's, washing my hands putting and taken them off. To worrying about many health matters.
I'll cut to the chase. My main worry now is my girlfriends sexual past. This has helped ruin (Can't be sure if this was the only thing) two relationship already. I basically get hung up on how many they've slept with, other sexual acts, threesomes, one-night stands......the list goes on.
Even if i hear the answer i will keep asking...""""""""are you sure?""""""""...""""""""You can tell me"""""""". To changing the question to try and get answer. Its killing me. My new girlfriend been great so far. She doesn't know to much about OCD yet though. I desprate not to lose her. I don't want to ask her, cos the past shouldn't matter. She's a great girl and to be fair she hasn't done much. But this doesn't stop me worrying and asking. I can text her during the day at work for the reassurance.
I've driven my family insane with asking for reassurance. My Mum is good, she won't answer me which is the best way. I've had 10 CBT sessions but ran out of money. I am on medication, 100mg but doesn't seem to do much.
I keep thinking up new questions and it keeps going. I get so nervous and upset. """"""""What if she done this ?"""""""" I don't know what to do or how to handle this. I try so hard but then a few days later i ask again. It never leaves my head. If i don't ask, i think well if she's done this what will i do ? I don't want to leave her but its so hard.

"Hi again,
It's been a tough festive season, what with me ending up bedridden with a stomach problem, which lead to a few problems I had recently with keeping hygienic (a typical problem amongst OCDers), but I'm back on the right track again.
What helped though was watching my mum's boyfriend washing his hands, as it taught to me that if you scrub well, it doesn't matter how much soap you use. Maybe I ought to follow that principle. At the moment though, my skills at keeping my OCD in check have improved ten-fold, mainly due to my ability to put it on the back foot, by enforcing perspective, and doing things I enjoy doing. This is brilliant for me, as it's allowed for me to gain confidence to allow for me to do things that normally I would put off. It will take a while to cure me completely, but I am on the right lines.

I felt upset for much of the morning, and then after a bit of reading, I decided to do something I didn't want to do... fix it myself. My worry is that everything I touch turns to dust, and I didn't want to scratch a lens which already is covered in dust, has a tiny scratch, and now has a visible thumbprint! So, I took one of mum's pentax cloths, gently wiped it... and that was it! I solved it all by myself! Now, touch wood, I need never do it again! :a1_cheesygrin:

"Hey everyone. 
First of all, a happy new year to you all. Herein are some amazing and wonderful people who I have had the pleasure of talking to and who, in their spare time, offer help and guidance. Trust me when I say you folks (you know who you are) are invaluable treasures and I hope, when my OCD gets intense, like with others here, to help and give back in the same way. Here in the UK, while available on the NHS, CBT and other forms of psychotherapy are hard to come by unless you have the financial means or employment benefits to go privately. With this in mind, the efforts of those here who give support to others goes and incredibly long way. For anyone reading this who is new and/or is struggling, do TRY and listen to these kind folk and their advice. While sometimes it may seem abrupt, the cold hard reality is that there is no easy way around OCD. Take their advice and never give up on yourself. 
While my OCD is still in a bad place, I can tell you that when I joined this forum over a year ago, at that time, I was often unable to sleep in my own bed due to fears of contamination and would spend numerous nights sleeping on our couch scared to even step foot into my bedroom. While I obviously do give credit also to my therapist who I must say has been a gem too, if it wasn’t for the words of PolarBear and others that night months ago that shook me out of that place I was in, I would have never taken the chance to push myself back into my room that night and now I don’t sleep downstairs at all!
While obviously there are still many issues which remain, from moral ruminations to contamination issues, checking and revulsion things amongst other problems, this place has at least in part helped me on my way and it is the success stories of people such as PB, Taurean and of course those others here that I now believe I can beat this or at least reduce it to the point I can have a better quality of life and that in itself is so exciting and thrilling. 
So, as for 2019, I intend to battle the fear of feces, urine, cat poo and many other horrors that my OCD has made me fear and push on. And as terrifying as they might be, I will try. You have to try. You have to want to get better and you have to push yourself. I know you people can and I will fight back with you all the way for a better future.

"This is a long post, a very long first post, just a warning before I start.
Hello,
I have been dealing with OCD for four years now, always Pure-O, and there have been many ups and downs along the way. Starting around March/April last year, I managed to reach a point where basically I had my OCD under total control, if I ever had an intrusive thought I would laugh in it's face and it would pass right by me, the last year up to May this year was superb, the best year I had experienced after my OCD kicked in four years ago. But in May, there was an incident that basically led to a downfall and all of the work I have put in to fighting this over the last four years feels like it has been rendered irrelevant, I feel as if a big 'reset' button has been pushed and I'm back in the same situation I was in when the whole OCD thing first kicked off.
Before I go into what caused this downfall, I will mention that my OCD originally started out as POCD worries, but over the years I feel like my OCD has attacked me from many angles, I've had worries relating to parents, HOCD and many other various thoughts and themes have tried to attack me via OCD over the years, but every time I seem to have been able to overcome them.
But this incident in May feels different and I feel like there is honestly no hope of me getting out of this now as it's spiralled out of control, my mind feels frazzled. It's hard to put this into words as I don't like thinking or speaking or describing it but I feel I have to as I have contemplated posting on these forums since it originally happened, but have not been able to.
Before I start the story I would like to mention that my childhood was great, growing up was great, my family are and always have been great and the things my mind is trying to say happened to me I can guarantee nothing like that ever happened to me, at least the rational part of me knows that for a fact (of which I feel like there is so little of that rationality left now) so these worries and thoughts are even more disturbing and my OCD is trying to attack something I hold dear to me, my family.
But the incident was, I had a dream in which there was a peadophile, there literally wasn't anything else to suggest how or why this person was like that other than that fact that it ('it' being my subconcious or whatever creating the dream) said 'this person is a peadophile', but for some reason, my dream put my uncle's face on this peadophile, an uncle who was nothing of the sort, he was a great person but he died many years ago when I was young, all the time I knew him and the vague memories I have he was a great uncle. In this dream I remember myself (or my third person self in the dream) thinking 'what if he abused me as a child?' and I woke up literally sweating and full of so much anxiety I had to rush outside it was so horrible to try and cool down. This dream was just that, a stupid and crazy dream of which many have occurred to me, before and since this incident, but the subject matter and the fact that it put a family members face on the 'peadophile person' in the dream and made me have these thoughts about them is so horrible, the dream felt very vivid and weird.
But it didn't stop there, basically, I could not stop worrying about this now, the 'what if this actually happened?' going over and over, but my mind basically pulled other family members into it, not saying they abused me but basically that they knew this was happening, and it's pulled in my parents aswell, suggesting the same thing, 'they knew about this', it seems like my mind is trying to create a conspiracy against my family, or within my family relating to me as a child. This is honestly the most horrible thing I have ever experienced with OCD and I cannot see any way out of this, I have a lot of avoidance feelings towards family members now and even my parents (who only got brought into this whole thing today when I had an intrusive thought this morning and I basically couldn't get over it, it took over my mind, upto today I had solace in that my actual home life with my parents wasn't really affected but now this has ruined that aswell, at least it feels that way) when I still live at home with them, but these thoughts aren't true and I know deep down they aren't, it's my mind trying to make me think they are. I also have worries that basically, all my good memories of the uncle I was speaking about will basically be overrun by the fact that I will forever think he was a peadophile, which is also horrible to think about.
I just honestly don't know what to do, I feel like I have no way to handle these thoughts or control them or how to interact with my family anymore, I can't stress enough that my family were nothing like my mind is trying to make out, it's so far from the truth it's unreal, I had a great childhood and great time growing up, but it's the fact that my mind is trying to make me think these things about my childhood, of which I have only vagues memories as it's so long ago I can't remember in detail specifics of it, much like I imagine other people can't remember all the details and specifics of their childhood and growing up, that these things could in fact be true.
I won't lie and I will say I have thought about suicide in my situation as I don't ever see any future in which I perceive my family in the same way as before these thoughts, I feel as though they will always be 'cursed' now with these thoughts and just horrible connotations on them, I just don't know what to do, I'm at a complete loss.
I tried CBT therapy a number of years ago when my OCD first started out but I felt like it wasn't doing much for me, I wasn't comitting to it properly as I hadn't told any of my family or parents about the OCD (and still haven't to this day) so my appointments were sporadic, working around times where I could go to the sessions without being asked too many questions as I was trying to handle the OCD myself, I didn't feel like I could explain it rationally to my parents or anyone else and I was able to sort of fight the OCD off myself and keep a handle on it during the time I was having these CBT sessions, but to be honest it never really went anywhere or got off the ground.
I'm just looking for some sort of response, basically some reassurance, which I haven't seeked in a long time for my OCD. I hadn't looked at OCD forums for a couple of years as I had reached a point where I didn't need the reassurance, I felt like I could handle things fine but now is a time I feel I really need to just get some response of some sort and let the thoughts out in a way.

Slowly getting better from the Philosophical OCD, but a new theme popped up recently. 
It's about harming my family, and it's quite scary.

I don't wanna harm anyone, I'd rather die than kill someone, actually.

"Been a while since I posted and I'm loathe to be in a position where I'm posting again, but I wanted to share an incident to see if anyone could help me with good advice. 
One of the many OCD themes I have is making sure there's no fire risk in my apartment. This includes things like making sure nothing is left on charge, or switched on like the oven or hobs and making sure my laptop is not left charging whilst on my bed. The other night the girl who lives below me upset me over something and I felt very low and a bit angry. I remember waking up too early and decided to get another couple of hours sleep after messing about on my laptop for a while, the transformer unit was lying next to me on the mattress. I had an angry thought that I was leaving it there on purpose so that the transformer would cause a fire which would kill me and the girl downstairs, but then I had another passing thought that I would obviously wake up in that situation and put any fire out, then I just drifted off to sleep. 
I woke up 2 hours later and felt that the transformer was quite hot so immediately unplugged the laptop and put it on the floor. Didn't even think about it until later that day when I felt an overwhelming sense of guilt towards the girl who lives below. I've not been able to get it out of my head since, and although I did think """"""""well I'll wake up if it catches fire and put it out"""""""", I cannot stop focusing on the initial thought of feeling like I wanted to cause harm and also the inaction of deliberately NOT moving the transformer / unplugging the laptop before I fell alseep. At the time, I was on a high dose of quetapine and feeling pretty groggy too. 
I don't know why this gets me down so much, especially if had I known 100 percent that an action I did or didn't do would cause a fire, i.e. deliberately setting fire to something and leaving the house, that's obviously something I wouldn't do, but I feel bad because of something that """"""""could've happened""""""""..

"Hi, I am new to the forum. I have been having images of raping female (children in particular) in my mind for about three months now. I am so afraid that these thoughts could become action, and that I may kill someone (accidentally or not) in the process, be put to jail forever, never see my family again, and disappoint and put shame on them for eternity.
I watched pornography on the internet since I was 12/13. Some of which were of sexual abuse theme. I have also had sexual fantasies about children occasionally. But I think I am equally attracted by adults (or more so? I'm not sure.)
When I searched online about OCD, I found that intrusive OCD thoughts are ego-dystonic. But when thoughts about raping pop out into my mind (and when I fail to resist them quickly enough) I got sexually aroused, followed by intense fear. Does it mean my thoughts are ego-syntonic? Most of the time I tried to resist them as soon as I realised they were coming, but sometime I deliberately think about it as if to check whether I really enjoy it or not.
I am very aware of dark alleys when I walk on a street, and experience a mixture feeling of anxiety and something else when I see them. I am also very aware of little girls on the street, and feel like a predator when I look at them. Whenever I walk in the same direction as some female I felt as if I was following them. I really want to quit my job and stay at home forever but my family just wouldn't agree with it.
I have been seeing clinical psychologist and tried CBT for two months. My psychologist wouldn't let me continue my safety measures such us keeping both hands occupied with objects, thinking about the Cross when bad thoughts come up, and keeping myself on phone when out on the street.
I have just started taking SSRI for 2 days. The situation worsens during this week. When I woke up one morning a thought came up and said """"""""just let it (bad thing) happen today"""""""". Another day when I woke up another thought came up and said """"""""you never tried it, maybe it can reduce your pressure"""""""". Yet another day when I saw a little girl on the street (with her mom) I hear a voice in my mind saying """"""""abduct her"""""""". Just a while ago when I was on my computer, I suddenly had a thought """"""""research how to rape"""""""". All these thoughts are making me more and more scared, and they are becoming repetitive like new obsessive thoughts, and even appear in my dream and affect my sleep.
Do I have OCD or pedophilia+sexual sadism or all of them? What should I do, to prevent bad things from happening, and to cure my illness?

"Hi
My harm OCD returned a few months ago after a 5 year gap. Typically it centres around those i love the most.
I am undergoing CBT therapy at the moment, i`m just about to enter the `behavioural` part of the therapy and will be given some ERP techniques. I haven`t been on any medication for atleast 9 years as i had a bad reaction to a drug when my OCD was first diagnosed
I feel i have a good understanding of my OCD and do have days or even 1-2 weeks of realising they are just thoughts and using my CBT techniques helps keep them under control but the times i find hardest to deal with the thoughts are when impulses/urges occur. These don`t occur on a daily basis thank god, usually the urges start up every few weeks and last around a 5-7 days, but when they do, thats when i get really scared. The urges are the worst part of this whole condition for me and its during these times my OCD really gets a grip. Any one have any advice on how to deal with them?
Sorry i`ve been a bit vague about my whole OCD thingy but sometimes i find talking about it spikes me but i just need a bit of help with this issue

"Hello,
My OCD seems to be getting less and less realistic (i.e. a minute ago I prepared some microwave rice for my dog- it was brown rice and when I cooled the cooked rice down in some water, the water went murky. I am now worried that I might have dropped a fairy dishwasher tablet in the water!) and I have had lots of CBT including 12 weeks as an in-patient and several other series of treatment (one of which lasted 5 years) but my OCD just changes 'theme' all of the time so I cannot tackle it.
It seems to me that most OCDers try one anti-depressant then either suffer side-effects and stop taking it (which is what I did) or stay on it for a while, find it ineffective and then stop. I am just wondering whether anyone has stayed on a single anti-D for a longer period of time and found it effective for treating their OCD?

Infact thats how I know I have OCD as before I could just about handle and live with it. I get up everyday, and from the minute I open my eyes I'm thinking about it.

Obviously some days are better than others. I've been doing some research and it seems the best way to handle this is to accept it, which is hard as it's human instinct to fight something you don't want or like. I know that if I get used to the thoughts then the fear and guilt will eventually loose there hold on me, it's just going to take some amount of time.

Anyway, now I'm here, I felt that I wanted to share some things I have felt my OCD is improving on, even with meds too low to make a difference to my behaviour and very irregular CBT, so in other words, a story about how OCD can be improved by the individual.
A few months ago, my saliva was as good as poison in my mind toward my family. I have a fear that I have a blood transferred illness, and I always felt my saliva would have blood in, so they could never come in contact with it, and I went to extreme lengths to ensure this. However, since this, I now have a normal view of my saliva most of the time, to the extent I even managed to kiss somebody, and let my family touch my used cups without washing their hands etc. I don't know how this sounds, but it's a pretty large improvement, ok, I still have issues with my blood, but that is a whole different ball park, but even that is improving. For example, yesterday I had a scratch on my arm, that usually I'd have to wash many times, or cover with a bandaid, but instead, I just got on, and ignored it.
I'm a washer, I wash my hands, arms, whatever, a lot. I use to have to shower everyday, or have no contact with anything, as of late, I've been able to go without showering daily and continue as normal, maybe up until 3 days, and then normal people would expect you to shower, lol. I can now sleep in my bed without showering first (which in the past I couldnt do unless it was 'dirty', in which case I could touch anything in my house until washing). In general now I do less random hand washings, and can better ignore that 'what if' that comes up making me feel I havent washed, or something happened that should make me wash.
Ok, I admit I still have a lot to improve on, and I'm by no means free of OCD, but things like the above I suppose give me hope I'm going in the right direction.

"So I need to get this off my chest because I’m really struggling to work through this. If you guys can bear with me, I’d really appreciate it. 
  So I vented one issue earlier this week about brushing against things but the biggest issues I have I think involves urine, semen and feces. I feel incredibly uncomfortable with this stuff. Particularly, I’m very uncomfortable about spreading it, whether it be on my clothes, furniture or other items or people. Consequently I find it extremely difficult going to the bathroom or anything sexual. I also have an overactive bladder and I think often get urine on my legs by accident. Sometimes I get distracted and forget to wipe them and then I’ll blow into a huge panic when I realise I’ve walked into my room and I’ve spread onto everything from my bed to DVDs. Now I know we have spoken about this before but I need to re-understand what I’m meant to be doing. Wiping anything is never easy because it’s always wiping and then washing hands and when ever I do that, I think. Have I spread this on something else? If I leave it, then I feel incredibly uncomfortable and I have to wipe everything. If I defecate, wiping myself is very difficult mentally. I’m also wondering if I have touched my t-shirt or shorts and I can struggle to figure out what to do when it comes to pulling up my trousers. Consequently afterwards, touching my trousers also becomes something of an anxiety provoking issue. Touching my underwear is always a no no and should anything sexual happen, I literally panic about everything I touch. The idea of getting any of these substances on anything are horrifying. Please can someone talk through this with me?","['bathroom', 'washing hands', 'anxiety', 'anxiety']",[],"['bathroom', 'anxiety', 'washing hands']",,1.0,,,
"Just wanted to say I am having a really difficult time at the moment with the brain making negative neural connections.
It's wanting to do that continually, to keep sucking me into distress and then make the thoughts that this throws up """"""""loop"""""""". It's mainly OCD but with some other distortions.
I have been told what to do by my therapist, and I am doing that; this involves noting the thought, the connection being made, the type of distortion and a more rational way of looking at it. No complexity , simple and to the point.And essentially resisting the connection and distracting
I know of no especial reason for it to want to play this game, no especial fear - the usual harm themes but there we go.
So I am using the computer a lot to distract - and I'll watch a bit of TV and listen to the radio and read and play music- and I went out for two meals today to break thinking up - but that's why i am so active at the moment.It's actually a good distraction for me.","['OCD', 'fear', 'Thought']",['theme'],"['fear', 'Thought', 'theme', 'OCD']",1.0,,,,
"My OCD is episodic,taking the form of unpleasant thoughts of a violent theme repetitively """"""""looping"""""""", and whilst I know when I may be especially vulnerable, I've no way of knowing when it may kick off and when it may end; but a particularly unpleasant part of it is when it kicks in its difficult to shift, and it tries to maintain itself by seeking to revisit previous thought loops, which it dredges up from memory.
In practice what this means is that if I successfully apply """"""""The Four Steps"""""""" to a thought, applying distraction, it will seek to intrude with one of these previous loops.
And when its running, it causes unpleasant high arousal, which makes it difficult to relax and to sleep.On Thursday night I got virtually no sleep because of this, but I did manage to catch up on sleep at least last night.
Now when I'm not actually in an episode, and an intrusion comes to call, I am usually able to calmly push it aside. it's like as if I have mental shields up . Also in that phase I can operate very mindfully - just living and thinking in the moment - which is effectively best practice anyway. E.g. in my lunchtime either in Chelmsford or London when working I would go for a mindful walk - only aware of what i saw, smelt and heard during the walk - brilliant .
So that is where we'd like to get back to, without slipping down the OCD snakes.
I've looked through my recovery blueprint, which basically suggests inserting something into the vicious circle of thinking to break it - that's fine of course, but the OCD dredging up something else must also be dealt with at that time, as well as the """"""""Brainlock"""""""" creating a repetitive thought loop..
So this is where we are at right now - my wife is acting as support; we basically are seeking to:
Label, re-attribute then refocus intrusions - (that's going ok up to refocus)
Break the chain of distress
Shut down on OCD's introduction of old """"""""loops"""""""" to seek to restart the cycle of distress.
As you probably gather, I have no problem identifying the intrusions as OCD - what is a challenge is the issue that they stick in the frontal lobe of the brain as a""""""""loop"""""""" and its difficult to work around that to overcome that """"""""Brainlock"""""""".","['Thought', 'OCD']","['intrusion', 'theme']","['Thought', 'intrusion', 'theme', 'OCD']",1.0,,,,
"I don't usually post in this part of the forum, unless its to answer other people. I've had to make a very hard choice.
I was put on fluoxatine about 5 months ago, which coincided with myself taking a more pro-active view of my OCD treatment and really *pushing* myself (which worked wonders). Problem is, since my head injury last year I have had real troubles with migranes (I fainted and smacked the front of my head off the ground). The only medication that even dents the migranes reacts badly to the prozac, so I have had to take myself off them. I had to choose mind-shatering headaches, or a possible increace in OCD symptoms, and I chose the latter. Since coming off it, my mental rituals have still stayed at bay, but my paranoia, and my cleaning rituals are through the roof! I also cannot have any patience, I am screaming all the time, crying all the time and depressed all the time. I went to the dr yersterday, who told me he wanted to prescribe me a different ibuproven based anti infamitory, so I could go back on the prozac. I told him, not only does ibuproven NOT work, but it gives me a sore tummy. He didn't listen, prescribed me a high dose of prescription grade stuff, and I ended up having the whole of the lining of my stomach inflamed in an allergic reaction, and having tocall the out of hours emergency dr out as I could not even breathe with the pain.
I just don't know what to do, and what's worse, I don't care.

"Hi everyone, 
I am having such a horrible day and I need to write this down to get it off my chest.
I am feeling like I can't see an end to this relapse. I feel so disappointed in myself for getting into this OCD cycle again. 
I have been doing better than I was afew weeks ago but still keep falling back and I am so tired of it. I'm scared of feeling scared.
i have returned to work today after 5 weeks off and my OCD has been screaming at me all day. I have faced some major triggers today and I feel like I can't handle it.
i am 6 weeks into my medication increase, have felt some improvement but wondering should I increase again?
i have been having private cbt which has been focusing on exposure and I am not sure if it's doing me any good.
my therapist aims to spike my anxiety continually and does not give me any reassurance she just makes me feel worse. But should I still with this? Because I know reassurance isn't good.
this relapse has been pretty tough for me because I had made soooo much progress in the last 2 years since having my little boy. Felt like I was past the worst I could handle a relapse. Turns out I cnt and it feels worse than it's ever been. 
I don't know if it's going back to work that has set me off because I did have some good days over Christmas. 
I am feeling impatient and I just hate this OCD and how it makes us feel, trapped, scared, sad, hopeless. 
  I am terried of my emotions and losing control but more than anything terrified that I have been able to get back down this hole and struggle so much again. I thought I had learnt so much over the past few years.

"Hi everyone,
I am lying here frozen in fear and terrified of what my mind is capable of.
  i am currently having a relapse of my OCD which centres mainly around depression/suicide.
tgis has been building back up for afew weeks now and I am fully back in the throws of this OCD battle.
i was starting to feel realy low the last few weeks and worrying that I was slipping back and after having too much to drink at the weekend I realy struggling.
anyway I heard some terrible news about a girl I know killing herself yesterday and this has spiked me massively. I didn't know her too well just mainly through social media but I know that she suffered with anxiety and depression.
i was physically shaking and almost vomited when I heard the news it spiked me so much. I have been frozen in fear ever since. I have spent the last 2 days looking for similarities between me and her when the truth is I don't realy know much about her. But still I find myself putting myself in the same category and I am terrified this will also be my fate.
anyway I was relaxing in the bath earlier on and having a huge mental battle trying to convince myself I am 'not the type' of person to carry out something like that. And telling myself 'people make a plan to kill themselves' they feel relief from it, write a note, set a date etc etc all to reassure myself that that's not me.
so then my brain started to convince me that's what I was doing. Telling me I feel relief thinking of it, then a date popped in my head and I thought yes that's the date I'll do and I will want to.
  and now I feel sick to my stomach and scared that my brain is going to talk me into acting on these thoughts.
I am terrified that I am going to talk myself into it.","['social media', 'anxiety', 'anxiety', 'shaking', 'fear', 'OCD', 'depression', 'Thought']",['spike'],"['shaking', 'anxiety', 'social media', 'depression', 'fear', 'Thought', 'spike', 'OCD']",1.0,,,,

"Hello all,
I'm having a real bad time with severe OCD and major depressive episode.  I have suffered from OCD since my late teens.  I've been on Luvox since the early 2000's at various dosages.  Right now, I'm on 225mg, up from 200mg for several weeks after a huge spike occurred back in late June.  I had been on a maintenance dose of around 125-150mg for the last 7-8 years and was doing fairly well until a recent stressful Greyhound bus trip which sent me over the edge.  Typically, my symptoms are with my hands, focusing on my fingernails, with me being afraid of scratching/damaging things with them.
When I try to calm my mind down with rational thoughts, I get into a horrid existential crisis loop which really knocks me down for the kill.  It seems no matter where I turn or how I try to rationalize things, there is no relief.
The extremely distressful thoughts are centered around death and loved ones dying in the future.  They are so upsetting that I feel that I can not even attempt to use CBT or ERP therapy against them.  I'm trying to look for support in my area, but it is very difficult.  I can not afford private insurance and most, if not nearly all, therapists who specialize in OCD do not take public health insurance here in the U.S. I feel so lost and depressed because the treatment that would really help me out is not available.   I just purchased the Mindfulness Workbook for OCD from Amazon.  However, with the nature of the thoughts and the extreme distress that they're causing me, I don't feel that I will be very successful in doing it by myself.
It feels like my mind is going crazy and there is nothing I can do about it except to raise my medication dose to sky high levels and hope for the best.","['symptom', 'Medication', 'hope', 'Thought', 'OCD', 'Treatment']",['spike'],"['OCD', 'Treatment', 'Thought', 'spike', 'symptom', 'Medication', 'hope']",1.0,,,,

"My brain is going a million miles a minute, and it doesn’t help that outside factors are making me even more stressed about my wedding. 
  I keep thinking that the fact that I’m feeling anxiety about the wedding and being married in general means something is wrong. That it means I shouldn’t get married. I want to marry my fiancé, but I’m still scared. Stress is seriously messing with my stomach. My job is extremely boring and I can’t do anything to distract myself or I’ll get in trouble, so I just have the thoughts running around in my head all day. 
  then I’m upset about the fact that I’m more anxious and scared about the wedding than excited. I feel like I’m robbing myself of being happy. 
  it’s just constant rumination and feeling checking, then worrying about the feelings and on and on and on. 
  then, one of my bridesmaids still doesn’t have a dress and we’re a month out. It’s a long story but her plus another of my bridesmaids have been making this hard for me. THEN the person who was supposed to do my hair as a favor to my sister is no longer friends with my sister, so I have to figure out my hair. I still have a few DIY things to do and just UGH. I don’t LOVE my dress which makes me sad. I didn’t lose weight like I wanted to. 😭😭😭
  i know I’m rambling and that last bit isn’t even about ocd but I just want to cry. Which I did last night. And a few other times.

"Hey, everyone. So, I've had a pretty colorful history with OCD and depression--since about the age of 7, and I'm 26 now. I would have a really bad spike every 2 to 3 years from my early childhood to my mid teens, but since my early 20's, it has really put me through the ringer. I've had three brief hospitalizations over the past 4 years due to my OCD (because of the intense anxiety and suicidal thoughts that came from my harm theme). I seem to spike really bad for 3-4 weeks, and then I'll be good again for a few months to 2 or 3 years, depending on how my life is going. I had another bout in January that lasted about 3 weeks, but I was able to pull myself out of it by going about daily life. 
The past couple of months have been really stressful. I had an uncle die last month, and even though we weren't close, it was still incredibly emotionally trying, as he was my mom's older brother and his funeral was only the 2nd I've ever been to in my life. I also got promoted to a full-time lead position at my job. Unfortunately, with the death in the family and some unrelated health problems (the flu, a severe allergic reaction), I've already had to miss a lot of work, and though my boss has been understanding, I'm still on thin ice with the company attendance wise. There have also been a couple of major cash shortages under my watch, and while those aren't grounds for termination, I've still had to take responsibility for them.
I've also been incredibly stressed about my love life lately--or lack thereof. I'm 26 years old and have never had a real boyfriend or even a trashy one-night-stand. Guys are always really nice to me, but they just don't  find me attractive. I am the """"""""funny fat friend"""""""" everywhere I go. My last """"""""relationship"""""""" ended 2 years ago and lasted for about 2 years as well. He was a friend from high school, and though there wasn't a huge physical attraction, I really liked him. We would often text from 9 or 10 at night until the sun came up, we would go to the movies or just out driving. He always told me how beautiful I was and how much he cared about me, but physically, nothing ever happened. Though I knew that was abnormal, I liked him so much I didn't even care. There was no clean break-up. We just stopped hanging out and texting, and the next thing I know, his mom is talking about some cute girl he met at school.That definitely left a bad taste in my mouth about dating. Last summer he called me out of nowhere really upset and said he felt so guilty about what happened between us, but the reason he was never really into me the way he """"""""should have been"""""""" was because he was gay and his conservative family couldn't deal with it. We've become closer since his confession, but I've never had another relationship.  I keep wondering if it's ever going to happen for me. And then there are the questions about what will happen when/if it DOES. Will he think I'm a weirdo because I've never been in a real relationship? How do I bring up having such bad OCD and the mental hospitals without him running away?
So, I've been kind of depressed this week, and then last night, I gained a new fear that is making me feel totally insane. Granted, I've been watching a lot of scary movies lately. Last night while sitting on my couch, I happen to look into the blackness of my turned-off television and had the though """"""""It kind of looks like a person is sitting next to me."""""""" My mind formed an entire body and everything. Immediately I went cold and thought """"""""Wow, that's totally crazy! You know there's no one there."""""""" But even though I know it sounds dumb, every time I'm in front of the TV, I keep CHECKING to make sure there's nothing there. It's making me feel really crazy and paranoid that I have to keep checking. And then I read online about the comorbidity of OCD and schizophrenia, and I thought """"""""What if I have it?"""""""" I've always had such a strong tendency to daydream that I can feel like I'm somewhere else entirely  (though I've always been able to distinguish these daydreams from reality), so what if it's just something else I'll eventually be diagnosed with? I just feel really anxious and am needing advice.

"I really hate doing housework. Whenever I start cleaning it's a signal to me to get washing my hands. My hands are really good at the moment and I want to keep them that way.
However,
1. I took my quilt to the local launderette - to get it washed. Being brave going to a launderette as I don't know who's had what where. Anyway, as I was telling the man my details, I saw he had a dog out the back of the shop with him and the dog had a chop or some other fresh meat thing. I am so worried that the man will touch the dog or the raw meat and then touch my quilt. I am determined not to throw the quilt away but I am tempted. I haven't yet collected it.
2. I was in the middle of cleaning the kitchen - really going to town I saw some marks on the floor and (I didn't have my glasses on and thought it was crumbs or whatever off the work top so I got the hoover, but it didn't pick the bits up. I went to wash my hands for the nth time and saw some blood on the bathroom floor. Eeeek. My foot was bleeding (I'd trodden on something sharp - but when I had looked not seen anything) wehn I looked back on the kitchen floor there were little splodges everywhere. I have now mopped the floor. But I never think things get cleaned just more spread around. I am trying to convince myself that I have actually cleaned the floor, but I still feel I've just spread germs around (I have a big thing about blood) I'm worrying that even where there were no marks, there was blood and now it's everywhere.
I'm now diverting myself by coming on here - although it's more likely avoidance so I don't have to deal with it. I don't want to throw my mop away - but I don't know if I can keep it.
I haven't got any bleach atm - thought I did so am having a bit of a crisis.
Anyway - it's off my chest.
I know the rational side of the situation - but I just don't believe it!!! :blushing:

My anxiety is so bad its making me want to be sick right now, im in bed and am completely mentally drained. This is al too much, its too difficult and I really need some advice.
I won't go over my worry as you can find it in my other posts, I'll just say its to do with 'false memory'/intrusive thought about something extremely distressing. Ive tried so hard to let the though be there but it feels too real. The reason this came about was because I was drunk and tried to remember so hard the next day exactly what I said and done..I worry so much about being sent to prison if its true, having my life turned upside down and ruining everyone elses, especially my kids.
The thing is how is this ocd because if I knew the answer it would go away, my themes dont change its just this horrible horrible thing that's bothered me for over a year and I cant move on.
Please help me to see sense, I am worried now i could of been spiked, i didn't think I was sooo drunk as I remember most of the night. I am a sensible drinker normally.

"Hi again everyone, 
Please bare with me. I know exactly what I have to do but just need to talk about everything...
i know I post often about my hiv/hep c worries and this includes feeling for the lymph nodes etc. I have to say my anxiety is at an absolute peak at the moment! I have just started (day 5) of taking a very small 10mg dose of citalopram. I have read loads of information about this drug and so I'm aware that it can often make your anxiety worse before it gets better! I hope that's the case for me too  at the moment I'm experiencing some what I'd call mild-medium side effects (nausea, quite bad insomnia, some headaches, high peak in anxiety!) 
the thing is my hiv worries are so bad at the moment! To the point where I'm absolutely convinced I've got it. I was tested almost 8 weeks after my potential """"""""exposure"""""""" I'd say maybe 7.5 weeks after. It came back negative. Thing is I'm not totally sure whether that's conclusive or not. I've googled (excessively I know  ) and found different opinions. Most say no need to retest unless it was a particularly risky exposure. Even the test itself said that.
I have all kinds of what ifs running through my mind. It was a """"""""self sample"""""""" kit. I.e. I took the blood sample myself and sent it off to the lab where they performed a duo test for hiv antigens and antibodies. These tests are pretty accurate after 4 weeks and apparently 100% after 8. I'm just thinking, what if I did it wrong somehow? I know hiv doesn't survive for long outside the body so how come they can test for it on blood that hits the air when it comes from my finger? Let alone as I'm getting the blood out my finger, it's going to be drying in the pot surely no as I collect it? Plus I had trouble getting enough of the stuff so had to do a few punctures so it took even more time to get the sample, all the while the stuff was drying in the pot!! I've googled incessantly trying to figure out whether or not the tests are still accurate after the blood has had exposure to the air. To no avail, the only one website says that the antibodies are still present, nothing about the antigens though. I assume however they wouldn't dispense these tests if they were going to provide inaccurate results. I'm also worried about an exposure 2 weeks prior to the test, this was apparently not a risky exposure at all, but my mind is convincing me I may have come into contact with blood and am therefore at risk. To make matters worse I had a cold about 5 weeks after this. Which i convinced myself was the seroconversion illness. Despite my main symptom being sneezing which is apparently too specific to be hiv related.
Then there's the node!! The nodes are causing me a lot of grief. Again, I've read online that swollen nodes are common in hiv patients. I've heard they're usually not localised (I.e. One swollen node which is what I have) but now I'm worried that I've got other swollen ones elsewhere that I can't feel! I also have pain in my shoulder/neck on that side. I'm now feeling around EVERYWHERE to check they're not swollen. However I know prodding them etc will cause them to swell and stay swollen. 
I'm actually so embarrassed by the amount of anxiety I'm experiencing! I'm quite reluctant to post this as I know what to do... just ride it out, believe in the test i had and stop prodding the nodes. I just needed to get it all off of my chest! I know it's OCD blowing my risk out of proportion, but jeeze it's horrible ATM! I even woke up this morning and panicked cause my pee was a different colour to normal... And googling my username on here to see if my posts come up!!
i suppose I just need some encouragement/support to get through this rough patch!! Thanks to anyone who actually reads through all that!! I'm sure it reads like a massive rumination !!

"I have been doing somewhat well with my OCD--I had confronted a couple of ritualistic aspects of it and was feeling much better about things. I stillf eel despair about my future but at least iw as more productive. My brother got my mother and I a device for our tv-but because our tv is an old hand me down the device doesnt work properly so we decided it was time to get a new tv--our first since 1980.
Because our only entertainment is watching movies now and then-we decided to get a good one. But then my mother had a bad fall and hurt her chest-and has been in a fair bit of pain now and then-and sometimes quite irritable.I could have prevented it if I had been smart enough to realize she had trouble getting out of the bathtub as she had trouble before-and she was a little reckless because of her mental state(she has a mental condition she takes pills for) . It makes me angry I could have prevented this added problem.
My ocd has used this incident to aggravate my anxiety and I have had more problems dealing with it.
I am even nervous about getting a tv because my brother, who is somewhat sociopathic, does not usually like us to buy anything and he takes the fun out of anything.
Plus I have not actually had a face to face conversation with him for over 3 years-even though he visits the house twice a week. This is partly because I dont really have anything to say to him that cant be said in email or by phone, but also because my ocd has latched onto controlling my exposure to people since my life is pretty much limited to my mother and anonymous store clerks. He says that one person cannot assemble or move the tv(a flat screen type) so that I have to help him. At first this didnt bother me but now I am very nervous about it. In the past he has said things of a mean nature to try to scare me out of spite(i.e. he borrowed and drove my mother's car into the ground and refused to help her get another--I dont drive--too nervous--and when she finally decided to get one when she was partly out of her mind--he didnt want to help her get one--he wanted me to deal with it-and at the time Iw as very sick and I told him it was his responsibility so he took her to the car dealership, cursing me in the parking lot as he was there--and took her to the bank and withdrew all our savings--$20 000 to buy a car which, when she came out of her mental state, she no longer felt confident enough to drive, and which he disapproved of_. So we have a car that we cant sell without losing many thousands, and when he got it-he called me and said I had to drive home with her-and he lied saying she hadnt driven at all--not since he had ruined her car 8 years earlier--but she had driven in his car to the dealership--because he dared her to do it, and for some reason, in her state, she was focused and energetic enough to do it.
Sorry for the ramble but--I find myself nervous to be in the same room with him, and feel that I would rather get the tv myself and assemble it myself...I dont believe it can be so big that it cant be assembled by one person.
I also have ocd issues about what images are the first to appear on the screen which is another reason i dont like him being involved if I can avoid it.
I know I should just let things fall as they may--but its very hard-I just feel bad about the whole situation and nervous.
Plus the hospital intake worker called(I had gone for a session and opted not to continue because they didnt seem very helpful)and said they have a general anxiety therapy group at the hospital and could give me a referral. So I said yes--but havent heard back and its been a few days.
I am thinking they will say my condition is too specialized for genral anxiety even though dont feel very good about being in a therapy group.
I hope that makes some sense. I usually post and then disappear for a few days as I struggle to deal with things on my own but I am in dire straits again.
Oh and my OCD has a strong mental component to it where it isnt just about physical rituals-mainly controlling my exposure to images--by subject, time, size etc...but also mental thoughts--this is the worst part of it--I have to think of certain images when I am doing some things--and sometimes it is very very hard-I cant walk around the house at times without my mind constantly assaulting me. I have been resisting the urge to do the mental rituals but I relapse.

"I've been out of work for 6 months. I got laid off due to lack of work but I'm sure they picked me to get rid of because of my ocd . I spent a lot of time at work cleaning and organizing my tools , washing hands, glasses, and keys etc.
Over the last ten years my marriage has fallen apart, a result of my ocd, but we are in counseling . Just in the past two sessions I have started to talk openly about my ocd . I have had severe symptoms for the last twenty years. I have kept most of my symptoms hidden from family and friends, but the contamination part shows through no matter how hard I tried to hide it.
I don't want to lose my spouse, but I feel as if my spouse would be better off leaving me, then I could be alone and at least my ocd wouldn't bug anyone else but me
Sorry for just kind of going on about different stuff but this is what is going around in my head right now making it impossible to sleep Hopefully getting it out will allow me to sleep now .

"Happy New Year everyone!
I was hoping you could give me some advice. I have had ocd for a few years now, (ever since my first year at university and I graduated in 2005). It started out as obsessive checking – iron, checking door was locked etc. But then as I got older and started to have boyfriends it turned into obsessive worrying, particularly about HIV. This past year I’ve also been struggling with washing my hands too much although thankfully I think it is getting better now.
Anyway, the last few months have been ok for me OCD-wise. I think a lot of this is due to my boyfriend who I met last year and who has been a huge support to me. We are thinking of getting married within the next year. I spent Christmas with him and his family and arrived back in France (where I’m working) last Friday. However, just 2 days ago I started to have horrible thoughts again, about my ex-boyfriend and HIV. I know it’s silly because my ex-boyfriend was a nice guy and I would think very unlikely to have HIV. Besides, I only ever had protected sex with him. But these thoughts are stuck in my head again and I don’t know how to get rid of them other than by having an HIV test. I’ve had several HIV tests in the past, for a variety of not-very-good reasons and I can’t bear the thought of having another one. I’ve spoken to my boyfriend about it and he thinks it’s a bad idea for me to have another test. He says that these tests only give me temporary relief from my thoughts and in the end they make me even more vulnerable. I know what he says is right but I can’t see another way out. I think part of the reason I’m so anxious at the moment is because I think I’ve found the right person for me and I’m excited about my future. Which, inevitably, makes me terrified that something is going to happen to ruin it for me. Has anyone ever felt like this? What do you think I should do? :dry:

"Hello everyone. I'm sorry to bother you all, but I can't sleep and I'm supposed to be awake in less than two hours. Our family is attending a special service for Easter tomorrow. At first I was excited, but now I feel like I'm going to be sick. There are going to so many people there, many more than normal, and I'm just thinking about how many days (or lives) I could ruin if I'm not careful enough. I just know I'm going to upset someone, or at least, I think I will. The reason for which I cannot sleep is quite a strange one. Earlier today, I accidentally made my mom upset. As a result, I thought, """"""""well now I'm not allowed to sleep tonight."""""""" I don't know where that idea came from, but nonetheless, I'm awake. I can't even close my eyes without thinking, """"""""well I must be the most awful being on the planet."""""""" So I began to do my rituals (I know). First I couldn't stop reading, then I couldn't stop washing, then rocking. Now I can't stop tapping my feet, though I suppose it would have been an issue had I not started in the first place.
*sigh*
I guess I'll just lay here, wallowing in guilt. Guilt because I think I'm going to upset people tomorrow, guilt because I've upset people today, guilt because I don't think I feel guilty enough, and guilt because I feel so bad whilst living such a privileged life. I mean, I'm talking to you all through a smartphone for goodness sake. That makes me feel like evil scum. Heck, I AM evil scum. I'm so disgusted with myself. I'm a monster, a monster I tell you. I doubt I'll get any sleep tonight; it's almost 5:30am now. Ah well, at least I could get my thoughts out there. Thank you to anyone who reads this.

"Hi guys, just signed and thought I'd introduce myself and say how refreshing this website seems especially on such a personal, scary subject as OCD!
I would say OCD has only really taken control of my life for the last year I would say that it's always been there just waiting for me to hit a bad patch before staking claim of my life. Looking back on it there have been times where I would be checking things before I went to bed (alarm clock, bank card, car key) holding them looking at them but not actually believing that they where there, and thinking to myself as the checking took longer and longer that this could send me mad. Well I think it's fair to say that it did:(
I stopped trusting my brain. Now when checking things or washing hands I don't stop based on the facts (seeing the item touching the item) I have to do it until it feels right for example holding down the alarm clock button until my fingers bleed so I can say right the alarm is defo on now, or washing my hands until it feels right not so I don't get germs but so I don't pass them on to others.
I find OCD is constantly contradicting it's self for example I spend just as much time looking in the rear mirror when I'm driving to make sure I havnt hit anyone but as a result I'm more likely to have an accident. Washing my hands till they bleed so I don't pass on germs but now my hands are bleeding and I'm scared that someone might come into contact with my blood!,
Anyway just thought I'd say thanks for sharing your thoughts as I think to key to beating this is knowing what is ur OCD when it's telling you to do things and through reading your posts I can see I'm not the only one and perhaps it can help me beat it:)","['site', 'bleeding', 'Thought', 'checking', 'OCD', 'washing hands']",[],"['bleeding', 'washing hands', 'site', 'Thought', 'checking', 'OCD']",,1.0,,,

Other than stopping washing my hands as much, has anyone any suggestions how I can make the skin on my hands heal quicker??
I don't wash my hands as much as when my OCD was really bad when every time I washed then I washed them multiple times and very thoroughly plus was always using hand sanitizer, but I've battled with washing my hands too much for a few years and whatever I do there seems to be a lot of occasions throughout the day when I have reason to wash them. With the added winter cold, my hands are red, sore, dry, chapped and split at the moment :-(
I am always putting hand cream on them and have tried numerous varieties, but that's not enough. I wish there was some quick fix to make my skin healthy again.

"Hi all, just a quick one! 
After completing my CBT at the beginning of 2017 I have been lucky enough to be completely OCD free for nearly the past 4 months which I am so grateful for. 
However...I have mild asthma and recently I've had a bad chest infection meaning I feel very tight chested and breathless. The doctors have told me it will pass on its own and I don't need antibiotics but I feel like my anxiety has spiked and I am obsessively worrying about not being about to breathe and dying / thinking do I need to go to hospital?  I am worried that it's reminents of OCD starting to flare up! 
I really want to nip this in the bud but I can't shake this fear of something awful happening it's really hard to know how much of this chest tightness is real and how much is imagined / being made worse by this health anxiety . I don't know whether to avoid things like exercise in fear of making my chest worse but at the same time if this is OCD again I don't want to give it more power by avoiding these things. 
Does anyone any have any tips of how I can deal with/overcome this?

"Hello,
I seem to have developed health anxiety over the past 3-4 years. I can't clearly differentiate my health anxiety from my OCD. I think I am also experiencing Sensorimotor OCD, in relation to my pulse and my breathing. It all seems to overlap and blend together.
I was making some progress with my counselor, but she sadly passed away with cancer. Since then (her replacement wasn't as good in my opinion) I have started to struggle with my health anxiety and OCD. 
While I wait for a new psychologist/counselor who specializes in this area (should have one soon), I wondered if anyone has any books or resources they would recommend for health anxiety - or health themed OCD?

"Long time lurker / haven’t posted in a long time ... Long story short - I’ve been referred to the hospital for an issue that my GP doesn’t think is sinister (her words) but which needs a specialist to diagnose. I’ve been struggling with this ‘news’ as I have quite debilitating health anxiety at the best of times but the letter I received this morning, giving my appt details has unleashed the OCD monster; lots of mention of urgency and cancer, early diagnosis, etc. My doctor has assured me THREE times that the issue isn’t anything to worry about that but, that’s not how OCD works, is it?! Intellectually I know I needn’t worry. But my mind, nevertheless, won’t shut up. Cue endless, compulsive ruminations and a very unhappy, distracted me.
I am not looking for reassurance, obviously - in fact part of the problem here is that this doctor, who is lovely and very kind and patient, thinks she is helping me by referring me on (this has previously happened on a number of occasions before). The referral and the wording of the letter has, naturally, raised some doubts and many ‘what ifs’ in my poor addled mind. 
I don’t have a therapist at the moment (soon, hopefully, but not at the moment) but I need some support/guidance dealing with this. Can anyone recommend some solid resources specifically on OCD related to health, so I can CBT the heck out of this thing before it does me in. I would quite like to get some sleep/perspective!

"My main OCD concern is cleanliness and washing rituals, however when I was younger I first became depressed and worried all the time over the fact that I was afraid I was seriously ill. Each month I would have a different concern...I grew out of it mainly and my OCD took on new forms.

Anyway....a few weeks back I found out that someone who I work with has been diagnosed with cancer and only has about 18 months to live...I have always hated hearing news like this ( as of course everybody does ) but it has always set me of worrying about health etc. I thought I was alot better with it these days but the past 2 weeks I have started worrying and obsessing over my health again....I am worried I can feel a lump in my face and despite going to the docs about it twice I am still concerned....I am going to spoil christmas this year again, and I can sense everyone at home starting to get annoyed and angry with me but I dont seem to be able to stop. I woke up in the middle of the night worrying and proceeded to spend the next half hour feeling for lumps...getting myself more and more worked up by the second. Is this all OCD?

"My latest worry is my digestive system and my weight gain which is doesn't reflect my eating habits.
I've been researching unexplained weight gain and bloating/heartburn, and I really think that I could have polycystic ovaries, which cause weight gain, or Cushings Syndrome...called the 'ugly disease'. A lot of the symptoms of either fit, and I know that my weight gain isn't due to over eating or lack of exercise!
I have the thinning hair, excessive superficial hair on the face and chest. Anxiety and depression go with it too and there are other symptoms that fit. Apparently many people with panic disorder develop it because of the constant release of cortisol from the adrenal glands in the blood...more than the body can cope with, or it can be to do with a benign tumour on the pituatory gland.
I can't help thinking this way because I am 3 stone over my ideal weight and my diet is what you would class as normal. I've even stuck to the advise I received about avoiding the particular foods I am allergic to and I have gained 5 pounds!
I despair..I really do. I hate my body. Cushings syndrome is said to be a very cruel illness because other people think that because you're overweight that your greedy with your food, when your eating quite normally.
I might ask my doctor about it when I go for my blood test results this week. But apparently the test for Cushings Syndrome is requires a few tests and the condition is fairly rare, so I expect the doctor will probably think I'm being a hyperchondriac and send me away. The onset of the condition is at the age of about 40, and I'm 43 now, which also fits. I was 12 stone before I conceived 8 years ago and I cannot lose the 2 to 3 stone I need to lose. It's getting so that I'm frightened to put anything in my mouth!
Just really fed up with myself and my body.

"The psychiatrist says I have OCD and my family say it is pretty obvious as when I was little I had to do rituals in a certain order or something bad would happen and I have suffered from bad thoughts about God, which I can't shake, make me doubt that I am a good person etc But its been so long now I feel like I have forgotten who I am. I used to be able to reassure myself that despite it all I was a good person but now I am afraid. Im afraid that I am a bad person and the only reason that I feel sorry for having these bad thoughts is because I am afraid of hell, which makes me a selfish person. I am afraid that somehow I'm doing it on purpose because sometimes I can almost 'see' what my brain is going to think and I don't know how to stop it, sometimes I can and sometimes its like I have to think the thought. I have always maintained that I don't want to think these thoughts but what if I actually do? I get so worried about this I feel like I shouldn't marry my fiancee because he's so good he shouldn't marry a person like me, I shouldn't talk to my sister in case she picks it up from me and I shouldn't do any of the things I enjoy because I'm so wretched.
I don't think I have OCD, I feel like I am just a messed up, selfish little girl. I just don't know myself anymore. It's all I ever think about, which makes me have more bad thoughts. Its like my brain is daring me to have these thoughts but I don't want them. I used to be a good girl. I used to pray every night, sing in the church choir, I didn't smoke or drink or swear but now I feel like I don't know who I am anymore. I pray but I feel like I don't deserve to because somewhere in me there must be something bad that is doing this all on purpose.
I wake up in the morning afraid of thinking something bad, which of course makes me think something bad. I am so afraid of hell that I wish sometimes that I had never been born. I pray to God to kill me now to make these thoughts stop but sometimes I am frightened and think what if I don't mean it? Am I just saying that to make God feel sorry for me and forgive me? I feel like I must be a really manipulative person and that frightens me because I honestly don't feel like I know who I am anymore.
When I have these bad thoughts its often like my brain is searching for the opportunity to think them but I don't want to think them and of course, when I have I feel awful but I don't know how to control them. I know that if these was a tablet I could take or an opperation I could have to make these thoughts go away, I would take it in a heartbeat because I know that I never wanted them in the first place. I don't want to be like this. I just feel like someone has taken a whisk to my insides and I am all mixed up.
I'm constantly asking my family if I am ok, if I am normal but it's like I have become numb to their reassurance. I am so afraid of what I might be and what that might mean. I just wish it would all stop but I don't know how to make it. I don't like offending or upsetting anyone, least of all God who has helped me at every turn in myh path but I honestly feel like my brain is somehow doing it on purpose but I know that I don't want to think these thoughts. I try to think about them to work out how they come into my brain but I can't explain it because I don't understand it.

"Hello
I thought I would introduce myself.
I'm a 36 year old man and I am 99% sure I have OCD and its other aspects.  I can recall elements I from when I was much younger that fit.  Today I have repetitive thoughts over taps, the Iron, oven, checking doors, handbrake in the car etc etc.  I tend to miss the bus or be in a panic to get it as I never trust what my eyes see.  I often have to sit in the car checking the handbrake.... and still seem to have to go back to check again after waking away.  No matter how often I check I feel uneasy walking away.  I also do rituals often though I try and resist... always 4,6,8 seconds counting (no idea why all even).  It was pointed out to me that I should look up BDD years ago as I have issues with feeling extremely ugly and odd looking that resulted in me embarrassed to go out anywhere except work in my early 20s.I definitely do the mirror/reflection thing.  It's hard to generate confidence from that and I often feel anxious walking past people etc.  It is on my mind from first waking and dominates my whole day and life.
I don't feel like an anxious person deep down, nor unconfident.  It's like OCD and all of that is like a cap keeping things in.  I've tried hard to just get on with things and I've done some good things but very difficult to make strides to really stop this.
I did go to the doctors around 2002 who referred me to a community mental health team.  I got to fill in a questionnaire but I found it pointless, and distinctly got the impression that unless I ticked the 'I feel suicidal' box it wasn't taken serious and after 2 visits I was told it was poor confidence and sent on my way. 
Anyway that's a summary.

Just to let you all know, I am posting under a new name, and those who knew me well have been notified of this. So I am not new here.
I haven't been on the forum for months and I apologise. Many things have changed since then, my battle with OCD has improved and I have got it under control a lot more. I have had more good days than bad and whilst I have not fully defeated it, I am still controlling it a lot better.
But I have my off days, days like today, where I spike and then this combines with my depression due to the fact I have left my college and have nothing to do at the moment. I am still in the process of finishing my A-level exams but I am not going to University in september. I changed plans and I think I am going in two years time after studying Business. But I am in Limbo as my new college haven't got in touch with me about an interview. Lots of things are stressing me out.
I am really bored. My friends dont really contact me and my distant family (cousins) dont either. I am still stewing over a nasty event which happened a month ago regarding myself and my ex girlfriend, who dumped me and made a sick joke about the death of a relative of mine. She also attacked me and called me pathetic and a loser and all the nice names under the sun. That really brought me down for a couple of weeks but I picked back up, but recently my OCD has been latching on to what was said, and I have been having uncontrollable thoughts and urges to want to get her back for what she said to me.
I am just angry and fed up. I dont have a life, my friends only contact me when it suits them, whenever I contact them I dont get a reply. Everyone else is busy except me. I am just fed up. Sorry this isnt a great return post but still I just needed to vent.

"Hello everyone!
Just found this forum and decided to pop in and say hello
In short: Two years ago I went through very heavy leukemia treatment, that involved bone marrow transplant and all that comes in the package
Fingers crossed, things are going not too bad, last time I checked there was still a remission.
But... during the time of treatment and after I obviously developed OCD. Classic, fear of bacterias, germs, washing hands every few minutes, safe zones at home, clean clothes all the time etc.
I went through some psychological help, but they said I'm a tough cookie and we stopped the sessions, as there was no reasonable progress. So basically I learned to live with it, use crazy amounts of alcohol hand sterilizer and things go slowly forward.
My wifie helps a lot, so it's not too bad.
There are plenty funny situations though, my mates have really good laugh with me sometimes:
""""""""I wont give you a handshake mate, because you'll go to have bath straight away! """"""""
...etc, so I take all this OCD stuff with pinch of salt now, nevertheless it can be a pain in the **** sometimes.
At work my boss helps me as much as he can, but there are hard times also, as I'm mobile IT tech, visiting """"""""dirty, mucky, infected"""""""" places, and that freaks me out occasionally.
My worst fears are people, or rather """"""""amount of people per cubical space"""""""", and all the bacteria they breathe out. I never use elevators if someone is inside, can't even imagine what would I do to the person that coughed or sneezed inside.
Got plenty things like that, no point of listing them all here..
Anyways, like I mentioned before, thought I'd join, say hello and read others experience with this silly condition.
Regards all!

Sometimes looking at other people find they are overcautious and check things more than once .When under Therapy she told me to get hobby an outlet from eveyday problems I started to go to the Gym and found it really helpful.Ok thats a long Haul but thats me .

"Hello,
I'm Chloe, i'm 21 and live on the south coast of the UK, I was diagnosed with OCD in September 2011, but I have had this condition for my whole life. My OCD has become very severe in the last four years since I have been at College studying Hairdressing. My OCD became so unbearable during this time that I was forced to withdraw from College in September 2011, one week into my final year. After i left College in September 2011 I had a mental breakdown due to all the stress of college.
My OCD consists of me carrying out rituals and behaviours to help relieve my anixiety, such as washing, ordering and checking. I also have a big fear of contamination. I do not leave my house and only go out to go to the supermarket.
I have completed 9 months worth of CBT at a stage 3 but this did not work, and at present I am not having CBT as I am on a 6 month waiting list for Stage 4 CBT thorough the NHS.
I am looking forward to talking to people who have OCD aswell and hopefully get some support.

"I wanted to introduce myself as I have just joined as a member again after many years. I am a male, 45 living in Sussex.
I am better able to live with the OCD than I used to. Sometimes I have flare-ups and sometimes it barely affects me. Since September I have had much more prolonged episodes with one episode going into another. This may be because my the long-attended therapy I was receiving had come to an end earlier in the year and I have missed having the means to express some of my anxiety. I have noticed that stress and changes in routine can make my condition worse and have historically struggled with Christmas because of my high expectations for the period.
My particular form of OCD is mainly Pure O although I do have fears over contamination sometimes. The ruminations I have often change and morph into others and include those relating to harming others. Currently I will get a thought pattern which almost feels like its stuck in my brain for a day or more and then as soom as it shifts another one takes it's place.
I have found that exercise really helps me and enjoy running long distance events, cycling, swimming and triathlon. Sport gives me a sense of purpose, distraction and makes me feel good. When my mind is going crazy I know that if I can still run and do sport I am still able to function.
I am optimistic that I will overcome OCD or learn to live with it without ill-effect and am lucky that I have a couple of very supportive friends, who I know I can talk to when things become tough. But sometimes I become really worn down by the Condition.

"Hi, :original:
I've taken the plunge and decided to say hello ! I have had, what I now know as OCD, for probably a lot longer than I think I have.
It has only started to be a real problem in the last 6 years, mainly comprising of unwanted thoughts around a sexual theme. Really punished myself to start with, convincing myself that I was deep down an evil person. Decided to seek out a private counsellor about 4 years ago which helped a lot, even just telling someone was a minor relief. It's only really lately that i feel I am not as disturbed by these thoughts as I once was, although still greatly bothered. I know that when I can just let the thought be (let them come and not analyse it) that it is easier. This is of course easier at some times than others. It's really helpful to read posts on this forum and realise you are not alone :original:","['OCD', 'Thought']",['theme'],"['Thought', 'theme', 'OCD']",1.0,,,,
"Hi,
I have not been diagnosed with OCD. I am not 100% sure OCD describes what s happening with me, but when I read about it and hear about it, it sounds so familiar.
I work as a mental health professional. I have worked with people who suffer from OCD. I therefore feel terrible thinking I may suffer from this as this raises so many questions for me (like does this make me a bad nurse/therapist?) I feel guilty and like I am hiding some terrible secret.
I have numerous rituals, many relating to numbers. The numbers 1, 3 and 5 I like. I hate 2, 4, 7, 9... I feel compelled to take 1 or 3 or 5 sweets, or to use this many pieces of loo roll. I feel like my life will be terrible if I don't stick to these rituals.
In the car the radio volume must be at a number I feel is """"""""acceptable"""""""" such as 16. If the number is at 16 for example My mind tells me that in 16 years I will have the best year of my life. If I cannot change the number, eg in someone else's car, I get a thought like I will die in that many years (say for example the vol is at 9).
I hold my breath until I see a red car, or silver, or three white vans in a row...whatever my mind conjures up. I tell myself I can't swallow until the same, or until my mouth is full of saliva.
I regularly think I will develop a tumour or cancer on the left side of my body, below my rib cage. I think may develop Ovarian cancer.
I move my jaw back and forth and count this. I tap my fingers off each other, this helps distract me but I get sore hands when doing it do often. I feel my legs and feet will seize up if I dont move them and so I often move them over and over and end up with very sore calf muscles. This is worse when I don't sleep we'll or work a nightshift, I seem to feel agitated.
I constantly worry about what others think of me. For the past few weeks I keep running a negative comment through in my head with a colleague said to me about 18 months ago. I feel like I am a fraud and that everyone will find out. I think I may be sacked at any time. Although rationally I don't think this will appen, but I constantly worry that my managers and colleagues don't think much of me.
On and on it goes.
I go to work, I am married, I meet friends. All the time I have these thoughts in my head, numbers, colours, hiding my breath, storing saliva in the hope it will save me and make me better (I know this sounds horrible!). never fully relaxed.
I have never written all this down, it's terrifying to admit...this is me.
Please tell me this resonates with someone out there?

"Hi,
My name is Chris and I am a long term OCD sufferer. I've had OCD for about 30 years, and over this time it has gone through various stages. It started off as a child checking everything was in its place in my school bag, this then transferred into my bedroom, and was constant checking of things being in place, drawers closed, CDs and tapes in the right place, wardrobe in precise order etc. As a child it was always my possessions (my bedroom mainly), since then I have my own house and a car, so it has obviously grown into these areas also. I always tried to manage it myself, I've seen about 4 therapists over the years, the current one being the best as I can really open up and drill down into my past. My OCD at the moment is the worst it has ever been, I am constantly checking gaps around objects, things are in the right place, a noise in the house can trigger a massive panic attack causing me to go around checking things have not moved. My car is also a huge issue, checking things haven't moved in the glove box and other compartments, checking windows are closed and doors are closed. I had a huge panic attack yesterday when I closed the boot of the car and I told myself I closed it too hard so all doors, windows and things in the car were affected. These sort of panic attacks feel like the end of the world. They parallise me from doing anything else. OCD rules my life. My wife is a huge support for me, she helps me a lot, and sometimes helps me with rituals which I know is not the right thing, but in order to get things checked quicker we do this. I really need help outside of my therapist, I've tried CBT and relaxation techniques, all of which have failed (perhaps I am not trying hard enough I don't know). I hold down a full time job, I would never let it impact my work which is a good thing, however like I said OCD does run our lives and takes up 95% of our free time. Any help or suggestions greatly appreciated.
Thanks
Chris.

"Hi
I'm new to the forum, this is a bit of a long one so I hope no one minds. Here goes...
I've been obsessive about my health for a long while now, worrying excessively about dying or getting some terrible illness. My GP referred me to a councillor, who the first week said I suffered from health anxiety. She mentioned something at my first appointment (I don't want to go into details) which then lead me to worry myself sick for the next week and I ended up with terrible thoughts in my head (not related to health) I couldn't get rid of which made me feel awful. Anyway, I saw her the following week and broke down and told her all these thoughts and she said I was suffering from obsessive thoughts which would be the reason I think about dying etc. She gave me a few techniques - putting the 'brake on' and visualising a nice memory. And doing away with the 'What If's' as thats all they are. Anyway, within a couple of days all the awful thoughts had disappeared and it was great. I had to see her again 8 days later and as this approached I started getting anxiety about getting the thoughts back but managed to control this. I saw her 3 days ago and she talked about some of the thoughts I had been having and the waves of anxiety started flooding over me again. I told her this and she said to concentrate on the techniques I'd used before, and suggested a couple of other things and gave me a relaxation cd to use. i have been trying to use all of these but the more I try the worse the anxiety gets and now I am anxious about the bad thoughts returning more than being anxious about the bad thoughts! (I must sound crazy). Anyway the more I worry about having the bad thoughts the more they start creeping back. I literally feel like my head is going to explode as I can't stop thinking about it all.
So my question is, do I actually have OCD or is it the counselling that has triggered it? I feel like I'm making myself ill thinking about it all. I almost wish I hadn't gone back again as I was fine. And I can't go back for 4 weeks due to the councillor being away then I'm on holiday, so I'm worried about how to get through it. I have such a lovely life and a loving family so I don't understand this anxiety.
Sorry its so long and garbled, it helps to write it all down. Thinking about it, I have had irrational thoughts before, usually in times of stress, but never like this.

"I've been a sufferer for over 20 years. Recently after a few sesions of CBT I have made improvement with reducing my rituals but feel now I am at a standstill and whilst trying to stop rituals seem to create others for example, my therapist asked me to change a routine of where I clean then sit for a while without washing (part of the ritual included bathtime for my daughter where I had to bath first, so my husband has taken over bathtime), and I am supposed to be dealing with the anxiety of changing this routine but instead of relaxingI am finding little jobs that need doing around the house, which mainly consists of cleaning. I have justified this by the fact that I have freed up time by this routine change and once all the """"""""long time overdue"""""""" jobs are done I will relax, or I am making excuses -not sure?? Today is a bad OCD day, in-laws visited, mother in law gave daughter a biscuit whilst out which raised my anxiety, and I normally hoover on a Saturday so felt uncomfortable all day which made me slightly withdrawn, so I have decided to stop hoovering twice a week, is this now avoidance?

"Hi everyone
just thought I'd say hello, been reading here for a few months.
Have had ocd most of my life (I realise that now) but it was mild to non-existent until a while ago. A few years ago I suffered a traumatic event which made the ocd a bit worse but still ok, then last year about 4/5 months ago it got so severe that I thought I was losing my mind ... there was I believe a biochemical reason for the ocd getting so bad.
Since then I've found this website, and done a whole lot of research into understanding this strange disorder (biochemical and psychological) and found/devised some things which help etc. I am trying to fight against it all, with varying success. At present the worse thing for me is checking and that has left me almost housebound ... although tonight I am going out, so feeling a bit stressed about that ... sigh.
I have about 5 forms of ocd, checking (the worse), contamination, ruminations, magical thinking and some responsibility ocd.
The checking is a transference from the original traumatic event. It is about a fear of losing something specific ... so I worry that I might have dropped something or thrown something away etc. So I think it might be ptsd ... which started the worries/fear/anxiety and hence triggered ocd with anxiety related 'learned behaviour' for other similar things.
Anyway this means I want to check anything which leaves the house, including myself and anywhere I subsequently go. Although, I am making some headway into contamination, and some of the ruminations. The magical thinking is almost gone and so is the responsibility ocd. But the checking is proving a much harder nut to crack.
I have used several techniques and ideas to help myself with some success, but am still fighting ... trying to get back to the place I was previously when the ocd didn't bother me at all. Which wasn't that long ago!
I had a slight flare up of the ocd as a child, but it was nothing as compared to this.
So just thought I'd introduce myself... and say hi to everyone. This site has really helped me to feel less like I am going mad! I have found it interesting to see that others sometimes have the exact same worries as I do, which makes me feel the human brain is so similar in what it picks up on and that there is hope to try to retrain your brain into not doing this stuff anymore.
Anyway thanks for this great site ...

"Hello everyone! I'm new
I've been having a hard time lately and I thought it would help if I wrote down what's been upsetting me. I've had OCD since I was a little kid, probably started around the time my parents split up. I can't remember if I've ever been properly diagnosed, but I was in therapy several times as a kid. It started with the fear that if I fall asleep everyone will disappear or die, went on to health concerns, thoughts of harming people I loved or people I love harming me, to obsessively checking in on the oven/windows/doors/my sleeping family members. Also a lot of religious stuff. Regardless of the specific theme, it was mostly centered around the fear of me becoming a horrible person or disappointing people. I felt really awful for a very long time and while I've had counselling I sadly never went through CBT. But the thoughts would spontaneously go away for some periods of time, and I am quite proud to say that even at their worst they never stopped me from achieving anything so far.
In the past year I've struggeled with POCD which is now completely gone (now I'm like: was I seriously ever thinking that?), just to be replaced by ROCD and it's driving me insane. At least I hope that it is ROCD. Because I hate confrontations, always have, so I like to torment myself with the usual thoughts of 'am I just staying because I'm afraid?'. It had a super sudden onset although it has happened before on a smaller scale: For around a month each time (I'm in a 3 year relationship. My first - which is giving me even more fuel for rumination) I would suddenly wake up to complete emptiness where there were feelings before. This always distressed me but I managed to just wait it out. But this time around it is much worse and I get quite panicked & recently have been feeling really sick a lot and every now and then I feel disgusted by having sex, or feel like I now dislike him. I feel like I am doomed to be really unhappy and make my partner really unhappy when I finally snap (he is pretty amazing, even if my ocd makes me doubt it!).
I'm constantly seeking for reassurance, although I know I won't find it, because I know that my thoughts and feelings could be true. I'm also terrified that I may have ROCD but that I'm also in the wrong relationship at the same time.
I'll call my GP for CBT soon, but I fear that it is going to take forever/help as little as the therapy I have had before.
Sorry for the rant & the super long sentences, hope some of you can relate! On a happier note, at least the weather is awesome

"Hello all,
I have had CBT and on meds due to OCD. I also have sleep apnoea, severe (how can it be quantified?) depression, tinnitus (which really is hell) and issues - overweight, other body issues.
I have a meticulously detailed exit strategy and took comfort from having this detailed plan. I used the planning process as distraction from my life.
I feel I am on the 'mend' (was I ever broken?) but do not know how to go forwards.
I have a beutiful family who have stood by me, and love and laughter has returned to our home. My two boys and wife are my world.
My question is one of responsibility and reassurance: I have a busy job and it has a lot of stresses attached to it (balanced with a lot of joy). But I am desperately tired, and have started to spiral again - as my name suggests it really is like swimming in a fish bowl - I just go around and around. (full credit to a pink flood song).
Anyhow - the question. Suicide is not an option, leaving my family is no longer an option (or desire). But leaving my work maybe, or going onto sick leave maybe. Biut if I do either then I feel I am giving in to OCD and in a twisted way would have reassurance that it is ok to feel and think this way as my GP has signed me off so it must be true... Does this make sense?
What do I do? I am the only wage earner and work in a specialised field with little transferable skills. Our lifestyle is not one of excesses, And our house will go if I don't work. I will fail my family if I don't work. But I may not be here much longer if I do work.
My sincere apologies if you read this and 'spike' (one main reason for not joining a forum before) but advice or even a chance to sound off is welcome.
Take care.","['depression', 'tinnitus', 'overweight', 'joy', 'OCD', 'process']",['spike'],"['process', 'tinnitus', 'depression', 'overweight', 'joy', 'spike', 'OCD']",1.0,,,,
"Okay um, hello I've been lurking here for a while, though only just signed up. Just thought this could be a good way to talk to other people with OCD, and get some things off my chest.
About me - I've had serious OCD since I was about 11, though before that I had minor things like stepping equal times and have my socks pulled up the same height and the like. But when I was 11 I saw people's faces...change I suppose, like their facial features would change shape in a way. At that time I had recently gotten a new toy, and though it sounds so stupid, I though this toy was causing people's faces to change. I hid this toy in one room, and stopped going into that room, then things from that room got moved into other rooms and so I stopped going into those. After only a few months I was stuck going into only 3 rooms (when the house has 11). About 3 years after this I was finally diagnosed with OCD. By this time I had stopped going to school and seeing friends - finding it very hard to leave the house. I then went to one therapist, who I didn't get along well with, and stopped seeing quite quickly. However the next one I had was an art therapist. She helped me a lot and got me back moving around the house fairly well, with a few rooms causing problems even now, but I am much more free. About a year after that she stopped seeing me and I started CBT. However I don't think at that point I was very motivated to fight the OCD, and didn't make use of it. Sadly my CBT therapist then left to do other things.
Things had improved for me greatly though, I had gotten my GCSE's, despite not going to school and instead being homeschooled. Good enough grades to get on the college course I wanted to.
The first term was absolutely brilliant. I adored it. I have some brilliant friends, though they don't know about my OCD, they are so kind and a lot of fun to be with. I was doing something I enjoyed a lot in college. Everything was just great.
Shortly after that though a new fear popped up. One of pregnancy. Now I have been with my boyfriend for a year, and he knows about my OCD. Though I was mindful and as careful as any normal person would be, the fear of pregnancy recently just became huge. To the point where I'm washing my hands after touching anything at all, and freakng out and crying a lot. I've only been to college for one day in the last 3 weeks. Thankfully my tutors know about my OCD, and so and understanding. But i'm missing everything that made me so happy.
In the last week or 2 i've made a lot of improvement, not washing my hands as much before touching clothes/sitting down on a lot of seats (haha this sounds so impossibly stupid and embarassing, but we all know how OCD can make the most impossible things seem possible), i've still not been able to go to college regularly (a little issue of my college books being kept next to the place where I put my clothes after I've seen my boyfriend, and so i'm afraid to touch them, which makes doing work very hard). It's just driving me crazy, because I know it's basically impossible because it's been months since I last saw my boyfriend (though he's so understanding, and i'm so lucky, he's sayed my boyfriend despite this and is waiting for me) so any sperm that could have gotten on my clothes/anything I touched would have died long ago. Ugh it's so annoying.
What prompted me to post this is that about an hour ago now I touched my bag which I may well have touched at one point with sperm on my hands. But I have touched it since then (before I was so afraid like this), so I didn't wash my hands and went to the bathroom and did other normal things, so I know it's fine, but still OCD won't shuttup. I already washed my hands quite a bit, but refusing to shower/wash clothes (The bag waved about a bit so i'm paranoid it touched me or something) because I know i'll then just be washing for hours. And since everyone else is sleeping right now don't want to wake them up. I'm still really paranoid and afraid, though less so than a little while ago, just hoping someone out there maybe has the same fear, or can at least say how silly I'm being for worrying about this (since people talking sense, often seems to help I find )
Thanks if you read that all, I know it's a lot >.>

"Hello everyone,
I think I am suffering from OCD.
I had rituals as a child such as checking taps and doors. This passed.
However, the last couple of months after being under some stress with work, study and family I have been having some horrible thoughts that give me instant panic attacks and even the urge to physically be sick.
My thoughts include:
- I was studying and started thinking """"""""what if I started stabbing myself in my head with my pencil?""""""""
- I feel uncomfortable being around knifes and scissors. I don't feel at ease until the knifes or scissors are out of my sight. I am scared that I might lose the plot and start stabbing people.
- I will be talking to people and I start thinking """"""""what if I start abusing them or yelling at them?"""""""" or """"""""what if i started choking them?""""""""
These thoughts are extremely distressing.
Can anyone relate to this? Such a horrible point in my life, I really want to free myself from these thoughts.

"Hi everyone, brand new to this forum and all of this. Just wondered if I could get some more opinions on my “issue” and also wondering if anyone else can relate to this too?! I have googled this of course but can’t find anything that relates exactly to my experiences. I understand that everyone suffers from this in different ways and no two people are the same... 
So here goes.. i seem to go through phases  (days, weeks, sometimes months) where I obsess over something different each time. It is usually something quite trivial and usually from a long time ago. For example, a few days ago I decided that I should have taken French as an A Level at school! I am in my 30’s and not taking French at school has NEVER been an issue in my life - until last week! 
Sometimes i will have obsess over past relationships, friendships etc and replay and re-write conversations over and over in my head. Sometimes I imagine how my life would be if I had made a different decision. I imagine how I might live in a different place, have a different job etc etc..
The list is endless really. But every time i go through one of these phases i seem to focus on something different each time. And it always brings me the same feelings of regret and frustration and generally feeling like I have done something wrong in my past. It gets to the point where its the first thing I think about when I wake in the morning and the same thing plays as if on a loop through my brain all day long. 
This is something that I have always done in one form or another as far back as I can even remember. I had never really thought it was a “thing” until recently. I have never spoken about it before to anyone as I just assumed that I was maybe just a bit odd in some way! 
I have recently looked in to this online and came across phrases such as Rumination, Pure O, and of course OCD - the only one I had previously heard of.
Does anyone have an opinion or similar experiences to what I have just described? If so I would love to hear from you.

"Hello, i have had a mild form of ocd for a few years now never done anything about it, just been used to all my rituals, it does get to me at times, prob more recently than ever.
I dont have bad thoughts or obsessive cleaning, or have any issues with germs. What i do is count, my number is 30. I do this all through out the day. I have a list of things to do before i go to bed, i hate doing it now and i do dread night time. I check both my back doors 30 times same with front door, cooker,washing machine, front door, lights, electrical items. I also have to check for at least 5 mins that my children are still breathing by poking them slightly so they move or roll over a few times. My worse thing is my electrical straightners i have to wait for them to cool down un plug them on my heat proof mat and check the switch 30 times then the same with the plug, this makes me quite anxious and can sometimes be known to do a few times especially if i am on my way out, i end up telling my self out loud 'just walk away'
I do this out and about to at other peoples houses and have same issues with making sure car doors are locked, my neighbours must think im nuts - standing there checking my door 30 times then the same for the car !!
Any way like i said its getting to me more now and would like to get rid of this and live 'normally'
What is bothering me more now is my daughter ( who is 11) is showing signs and i hate my self for it cause i know its my fault as she is copying me, this morning i shouted at her for making her bed perfect and it really was perfect she took ages doing it. and there is me having a go at her for it ! how dare i when i know its my fault that she is doing it !
This is now a problem, i need to help her and my self before she gets worse.

I'm new to this forum business, I just thought it might be nice to join and talk to other people like me. I've had OCD since I was 11 years old, so it's been 15 years of horrible thoughts and tortuous rituals. I am very pleased to say that I sought help about 4 years ago and had two years of CBT, which was amazing (once I accepted that I had to let the OCD go) and I've gone from being consumed by the condition to managing it well on a daily basis.
I'm looking forward to speaking to others with the condition, I've never met anyone else with it, and hopefully providing people a bit of help now that I'm so much better than I used to be. I'd also be interested in taking part in any research that is being conducted, I hate the way OCD is portrayed in the media and thought of among the general population, and would like to be able to educate people about the realities of the condition.
So yeah, that's me essentially. I don't know how to sign off now, feel shy like the first day of school! Perhaps I should just be British and say, 'Thank you, sorry, thank you'! Haha!","['Rituals', 'hope', 'interest', 'Thought', 'OCD']",[],"['hope', 'interest', 'Thought', 'Rituals', 'OCD']",,1.0,,,
"Hi there,
Just thought I'd say hello and introduce myself to everyone. I have had on OCD on and off for the 12 years or so. I seem to go through stages where things are really good and then suddenly seem to hit a real bad patch which I have been going through for the past few weeks!!
I have suffered from most types of OCD, it all started of with contamination and cleanliness and washing hands alot and then over the years I have had thoughts about harming others which was particular scary as it is the last thing I would ever want to do.
At the moment everything seems to be being thrown into the melting pot. I seem to be coping fairly well as i have lots of support with friends and family and also my Doctor has been very good. The main problem now is that I have been having some really crazy thoughts about things which are so unlikely to actually happen that I just don't seem to understand. The logical part of my mind is telling me it's rubbish but the OCD side tells me otherwise. I also have been suffering alot with anxiety which as I know OCD seems to feed on. I seem to have got that down quite well recently but I'm still feeling a little lost at the moment, but I know I will get there in the end, as I always do. I think it's because it's something quite new at the moment and my mind is trying to deal with it. I had CBT about 3 years ago which helped me alot and I'm trying to put that in to practise at the moment.
Hope I can help lots of you out there with my experiences.

"Hi,
I thought I would introduce myself to the forum. I've already posted a couple of replies, but though it would help if you all knew a little more about me.
My name is Martyn and I live in Cornwall with my lovely (and very supportive) wife Karen. I was hospitalised mid 2005 with depression/anxiety which as it turns out was most likely the result of my obsessive ruminations wearing me down. After seeing my Psychiatrist in December 2005, we agreed that is was very likely I was suffering from OCD and put my meds up from 30mg of seroxat up to 40mg.
My main OCD problems are excessive ruminations about impending disaster which will latch onto differing things depending on what I've read or what just pops into my head. My compulsive aspect takes the form of having to ask loads of people for reassurance over and over and also searching the net for solutions to my perceived problems or worries. Not all have solutions, so this doesn't always work.
My OCD has put a great strain on me and also my wife and I really want to manage it better. To help myself, I try to keep busy at work (I work in a computer support role) and at home, but it isn't always very easy as OCD can drain your energy and spirit so much. I am also reading Brain Lock by Schwartz which is helpful - any other book suggestions? In addition, I see a pscychotherapist once a week and try to practice CBT, although when the OCD is very bad, CBT can be very hard.
I feel for anyone suffering from OCD or an obsessive illness - unless you've been there it is difficult to imagine how painful it can be. I'll sign off by wishing you all well and good luck in challenging and managing your OCD. I look forward to interacting with you all.

I have Pure O and anxiety, my intrustive thoughts are mostly violent in theme, and at times totally ramdom in theme!
I have been on various meds, and now am having CBT also, no where near """"""""recoverd"""""""" but I am long way from the absolute seemingly constant despair of where i was about a year ago.
So all in all i can't complain, but being female, actually yes i can, ha ha. Would be nice to """"""""meet"""""""" other ladies with Pure O- not met a single one, but then i have never joined a forum before.
Anyway, looking forward to """"""""talking and meeting"""""""" others with Pure O , or any type of OCD actually.

"Hi Guys. I am a sufferer of OCD and I would say my condition is serious. I have suffered with various OCDs since the age of 15/16 and have got worse each year.
My main issues revolve around the people I love and keeping them safe through 'rituals' etc...
I decided to make a serious attempt at quitting my OCD only this weekend gone. I am an athlete who relies largely on mental toughness to compete at an elite/international level. I found myself getting increasingly anxious at competition/game time due to the 100s if not 1000s of rituals I would complete to avoid failure etc. Coupled with this I have recently found myself in a paranoid state regarding my girlfriend of 2 years. I am not a jealous person, nor do I have trust issues. The 'epiphany' happened after this weekend's competition, when even after performing various daily rituals I competed to a disappointing sub-optimal level. After speaking to my girlfriend at the competition. I decided that these rituals etc. were not working in a sporting environment and that I (much to my amazement) could not predict/alter the future by performing these rituals.
I found the most useful tool when coping with my OCD was to tell someone. As I mentioned earlier I explained to my girlfriend, and a day later my mum (who already knew vague details) over a coffee. My main reason for telling them was my ambition to break free of my OCD, and to warn them of my possible unusually short-temper brought on from anxiousness.
Anyway, I felt best to get this off my chest early. I will be using these forums as I attempt to manage my problems. I suppose it's nice to know that I'm not the only one!

"Have just discovered this site and forum and have to say I wish I'd tried looking sooner. I've always kept away from sites to do with my problems as I thought it would trigger old and new problems and make me feel even worse.
A little about me. I'm 26 living in england and have had OCD for as long as I can remember, though when I was younger I didn't realise I had this mental disability, I just did rituals, like having to turn lights on and off that sort of thing and put all the tv removes at a set angle.
As I've got older its got worse and worse. I've been being treated for what must be about 5 years now, taking between 20mg and 40 mg of fluoxotine daily.
The problem I have now is with my local doctors surgery. I have an acute fear of germs and catching diseases from people, I'm scared of people in general, have panic attacks when I'm outside. I've been outside on my own once in probably the last 5 or more years. I've always spoken to the doctor over the phone or they've come out to see me as I just can't bring myself to go into the surgery. Well now they are refusing to let me have my medication unless I go up there which I just can't do. They just think I'm able to switch off my fears and march up there put up with it and go home... I'm now left without my medication, the doctor is phoning later but I know I will just get the same 'force yourself to come up here after surgery when its quiet' speech. They say its inappropriate to come out and see me as I've not got a terminal illness, even though I live about 5 minutes away in the car...
I'm already feeling my OCD thoughts returning a lot stronger without the tablets and I'm now left just facing a gradual decline into being a nervous wreck again.
Any advice on what I should do? I should also add I'm not seeing any mental health professionals as I've been reluctant and a bit scared... I've always been quiet and shy... and this is made so much worse with the OCD fear of people... puts me in a difficult spot with getting help.
So what do you think about the situation? Any advice for me?

I have what I think is a reasonable worry and just need some advice please.
In work a colleague was telling us a story of her relative who became a drug adictct, the reason she actually became one was because one night she went out and got her drink spiked. This in turn led her to have some sort of breakdown, she was seeing all kinds of faces and her thoughts were getting all mixed up. This led her to going into a psychiatric ward and sent her into a downward spiral when she came out-living a life of drugs. Apparently she was beautiful and clever before this night out.
I am not saying for one second that I think I am going to become a drug addict, however I am comparing my night at this wedding were ive not experienced anything like it in the days that followed, even the night itself. I am aware that im a worrier so my anxiety was sky high thus causing me to think all kinds of awful things but I am worried their is a real probability that I could of been spiked. Obviously I wonder if this makes my disgusting false memory less likely or more likely to be real? What do I do here guys?

"hello all,
i only realised that i have ocd a couple of weeks ago after just coming across it on the web. im 19 years old and if i can remember i think i first started encountering the disorder when i was about 11 or 12 years old. back then i would do things like tapping things 2 or 3 times with my right hand and then my left and making sure that everyting was all neat and tidy, equal spaces between everything and making sure everything had its own place. i grew out of that - thankfully for me - however i now seem to be overchecking things. when i do stuff on the computer for example i keep on checking it again and again and again.
i almost commited suicide a few years back when i was suffering from depression. i went out for a few drinks and now after reading more about this website, i now realise that maybe the ocd + depression + alcohol was the cause of it and not my drink being spiked which was my initial thought.
i dont think i have it as bad as some people and hopefully like before i may grow out of it. after looking on this website i came across the 4 step guide for self treatment and i must admit its amazing. i started it on monday (i.e. when i think of something that needs checking i just say to myself - its not me its my ocd), however i finally gave in to it today and checked something which put off for a week, and im quite dissapointed in myself. but i knew it would be hard. i knew it would take a long time, a lot of patience and that i will have my ups and downs, but i do feel better in myself and i have a much more control over my urges.
regarding the thing i checked today, this is something that has been on the back of my mind for a a couple of weeks now (i used to check it almost5 maybe 6 times a day before) and as i said i have been able to keep tabs on for the most of this week but unfortunately i gave in to today. i now realise that if i dont check something the first time i think about it, i can easily put it to the back of my mind and move on, however if i keep checking things (like discussed above) it gets harder and harder to stop. so today i said to myself im going stop checking this (ive checked it 100 times now and i know that if i check it again, ill then want to check it again and again etc). now when ever it comes in to my mind again, i will just say its an obsessive thought, ignore it - and hopefully over time it will go fade away/
as i said i am 19 years, in a job that i love and have a girlfriend that i think the world of. im happy and am looking forward for a great life. i just hope for 3 things: a) that i can meet people on here and talk about our problems and help one another, b) hopefully grow out of the disorder - like before (i doubt it though), c) the self treatment may help me overcome my disorder - i really do believe that this will work. i know it will take time and a lot of effort but i feel so much better after a week of doing it so far.","['urge', 'depression', 'site', 'Thought', 'Treatment', 'OCD', 'hope', 'checking']","['spike', 'obsessive']","['urge', 'obsessive', 'hope', 'site', 'depression', 'Treatment', 'Thought', 'checking', 'spike', 'OCD']",1.0,,,,
"Hello everybody
I've been looking at posts very rarely on here over the last 4 years, but in the last month or so I've been looking at this site a lot more. I decided it was time to speak out recently because things have just got so intense, but I found another OCD forum and posted their first. I won't bore people by posting my life story here because it doesn't really matter.
This last couple of weeks things have just got so intense I don't know what to do with myself. I now can't walk around my flat, or go anywhere without having spike after spike. My OCD is getting far too smart and now knows the loop holes through my coping techniques.
I know that when my life style changes soon and I get some structure back and start seeing people I know, that I will start to get a bit better again. However, this probably isn't going to happen for a couple of weeks and so much can happen in a day let alone a couple of weeks. I think that I'm having a mini-breakdown and small quater life crisis.
I'm just so alone right now physically and mentally that maybe just even posting this will make me feel less alone...","['site', 'OCD']",['spike'],"['site', 'spike', 'OCD']",1.0,,,,
"Hi all,
I'm a 21 year old university student who has finally admitted to himself that the OCD is gettin out of control!
I first developed symptoms of OCD when I was 15, it was related to dead bodies, hand washing, face scrubbing and getting rid of """"""""contaminated"""""""" objects. It was a living hell, my face and hands were red and sore from all the washing and scrubbing and my sleep esacped me most nights due to the obessive thoughts of dead bodies that might be around me, and the constant thought I had touched them/been contaminated and washing my hands every time I had this thought!
My older sister (6 years older) saw I had a problem and tried to tell my mum. My sister encouraged me to see my GP, which I did. The GP was very supportive and due to my age at the time, got a call from the nearest clinic within 24 hours. I had gone to the GP without telling my mother, and when I told her I seeked help and what for, she went crazy!
She told me she would not let me get support and I was stupid for doing so, she told my father who was slightly more supportive but not much more so. I felt so confused and upset. I called the team that had been in contact telling them I didn't want the support. I had to carry on by myself, and I made progress slightly.
The thoughts of dead bodies wore off but something still stuck. I can't remember what was bothering me, but I kept trying to contact another mental health team ( as I was now 17) and they offered me help, but I kept turning it down, mainly due to shame and the fact I couldn't afford to travel there.
Things seemed to calm down for a while, although the hand washing has stayed with me forever, I can live with that. I got into university and moved to London, a big step. My OCD seemed to manifest again in the late stages of my first year, in student halls, this time carrying out head nodding rituals to prevent bad things happening (an odd ritual I know!).
Just before my second year my father passed away suddenly, and I think this aggrivated my OCD even more. His body was left unfound for 3-4 days, this still plays on my mind and I was so worried it would make me the way I was again, obsessing about dead bodies and contamination.
My second year grades were awful, partly due to depression after my fathers passing, partly due to my OCD and partly due to a new concept, BDD.
I'm in my final year of my degree now, my grades so far are not great and I have an exam at 2pm today! I've lost weight over the last few months which has helped me feel slightly happier but it seems to of made my BDD worse and my OCD is now in the strangest of forms once more, head nodding whilst saying a certain sentence to ensure nothing bad happens to a loved one. I can't say certain words as I beleive something bad will happen, If I look at certain things I have to apologise and say the sentence. I am religous and religion does play a somewhat significant role in my OCD although I do not practice my religion as much as I or you would expect. The hand washing thing can be bad, I now live in a Victorian era house, and it just feels cold and dirty all the time. My OCD rituals take up a lot of time when I'm by myself, when I'm with other people, it rarely arises.
I've come to the point now where I know I need help, although scared as a part of me is scared of the consequences of questioning and trying to stop my rituals. I've regestered with my local GP and hoping to get an appointment soon. Fortunatly, I'm entitled to 6 free councelling sessions from my uni, which has somewhat helped me realise I need help, not so much helped with my OCD.
I know this is a long intro, I do not expect anyone to read it all or reply, I think it has just done me good to get it all written down. I'm excited and scared at the thought of getting CBT although I'm also aware there is often a long waiting list.
After many years, I'm so gald to of joined the forum and hope this is the start of a very positive journey!
Please ignore any spelling/grammer errors, I'm very tired and have an exam soon!

I have just come across this website - for some yrs now I have suffered with manageable OCD: locking doors, washing hands etc etc (also logging out of facebook 20 million times)
It seems to be getting worse and worse - I have now have really bad/disgusting thoughts. They are so bad - I dont want to really post them on here. My paranoia is killing me.

Even though, I had left after only 10 mins - making some excuse to some friends and leaving in an anxiety attack. I am currently on holiday and am having attacks here that I said some horrible things to some party goers 2 nights ago. Even though I had only thought of these thoughts yesterday after the party took place - yet somehow I have convinced myself that I said those things 2 days ago. Its a case of 'what if I said......' and then 5 mins later 'its OMG - I did say those things - Im going to lose my girlf that I love, my job and my flat'. My paranioa extends to me not letting random ppl take photos of me on a night out as fear of these pics getting used for evidence or worse them taking the photos to a national paper with a caption - wanted for XYZ crime....or being accused of sexual/physical assult. If that happens I tell myself I will take the most drastic action possible......pls help/make me feel better.

Okay so from work today I visited someone I had been chatting to for a while from a popular dating app. I had asked the person repeatedly whilst chatting how old they were, they confirmed 18 years old. 
On arriving and meeting the person they looked really young, although I guess most 18 year olds do. This is where the major spike is created.......the person demanded money (which was part of he roleplay we had going on). I paid the person via bank transfer. A. The person looked young = in England, uk, it is illegal to pay for sexual services with anyone under the age of 18. 
I feel like utter rubbish! And my OCD is in overdrive. I feel vile for having to post this up here, but I was really craving human intense contact and of course I have needs like every other human here.

"Hi everyone
I've been really down at times over the last few months but this has to be amongst my worst patches, how I have felt today since I went to collect my results and then I spiked on the way home and it's all unravelled again in my brain. I knew the tiny bit of improvement I had wouldn't last long. It also seems that I can't stop thinking about stories I've heard on the news, and it's like somehow I put myself in those scenarios I have no connection with.
I really am at my wits end, I have cried constantly for the past hour or two and as I sit here typing this I still feel the same. I keep feeling an incredble amount of guilt for my brothers death as I still believe I could have saved him had I had the nouse to follow my gut instinct and get an ambulance. People say I was only 13 at the time but as I've said before, I have tossed and turned at night believing I was the one who took his life. I tried to wake him up when he was deep into his sleep and I felt because I touched him I may have done something without realising. I hate this and can't take it anymore.
And what's worse this P OCD which is really ruining my life and has done for nearly six months as I keep saying. I hate my dad for putting all this imagery and idea into my head when I was younger about the """"""""school fair incident"""""""" which never happened but my dad made me pretend it did. and all to just get back at my stepdad and ruin his reputation in the community with false lies, its all creeping back. Everyone hates my dad and I am ashamed of him and also ashamed that I am his son.
I keep getting an occasional urge every time I have a bad thought then I must punish myself in some way, for example cut myself. Although I have not carried this out yet (although I tried last week but didnt have the courage), it's an idea that always comes in. Another idea recently has been to have occasional comfort eating sessions where I go downstairs and just down loads of choclate bars or a few bags of crisps and I keep thinking if I do that, I'll make myself obese in order to punish myself. I know they are only thoughts but when they end up feeling real and its horrible, all thoughts are real but I wish they would give me some peace and just DIE, as I am always blaspheming and swearing at myself in my end, constantly repeating statements such as """"""""get out"""""""" and """""""" off"""""""" over and over, and pretending Im talking to someone whos hurt a kid and pretending I'm talking to them in my head, telling them how much I hate them. Arghhhh....
And it just feels like I was never meant to experience anything good in my life. I always seem to blame god and believe he is punishing me and my mum always tells me he isn't. I just wish somehow, somewhere, I could find an ounce of strength and get up and keep going but I feel back down again. I can't take it anymore. The thoughts of suicide are creeping back. I just wish this would all end but it wont.
If this doesnt end soon, I am going to get out of my mothers life because she doesn't deserve this at her age. I know a mothers love is unconditional but still, I can't take this anymore, I know deep down this is hurting her as much as it is me. I am fed up of being a burden to everyone. I just wish I wasn't. Things would be so simple if this never was in my mind. I want to either run away somewhere where nobody will ever find me or chuck myself in a canal. I AM REALLY SCARED of the future and what might be in store, or will this still be here when Im 20, 21 etc. That's how desperate I'm becoming. I'm too scared to seek help. I'm trying hard to do things myself and just hope and pray it will wear off eventually.
And I promise, I've posted too much recently, going over old ground and not making any progress. Until I make any, I won't post again because it's not fair to everyone else on here I just repeat myself. Sorry again folks. Hope nobody thinks any less of me, just needed to get this out.
Take care all

I've been having really bad anxiety about this, I''m trying to accept the thought like I did with my pocd and hocd but it's not working very well. Any advice?
the thing about the pocd is that at least you could always know that you had a choice to act on it, whereas with a mental illness you can't really help it. I realise that the theme isn't supposed to matter and it's treated the same way but this is really bugging me and idk what to do.

"Hey, this is my first post so thanks for taking time to read it. I am 23, dating my boyfriend (25) for the last 3 years. We've always had problems that were unexplainable. Then, three months ago he was diagnosed with OCD (Intrusive negative thoughts) and after extensive research it has literally explained every problem we've encountered since we have met. He currently sees a therapist every two weeks who started him on 20mg of Prozac which he has also been on for three weeks now.
My Issue: dating someone with this OCD is extremely difficult. We have a compassionate, respectful, supporting love and we are best friends. I want to be there for him and it kills me to see him in mental anguish. However, when his OCD spikes he is verbally harassing, and emotionally abusive. He focuses on my past which he will turn into (in his head) as being wild, irresponsible, and provocative. Keep in mind we all made mistakes as teenagers, this was before I met him, and now I am 23 and have been living for YEARS with a complete new set of morals. Not that I should have to justify myself...sigh..
His OCD cycle: He sees a trigger (my roommates partying, pictures of drinking on Facebook, etc) gets in his head that the behaviour is not normal, it is dirty and gross and repulsive. Directs these thoughts towards me, thinks that I will become my high school behaviours, or perhaps the behaviours that he sees my roommates or coworkers doing, which will then make me dirty and gross and not normal. Verbal harassment starts, name calling, putting down, makes things up to support his opinion about me. Then he (angrily) begs me for reassurance, begs me to tell him something/anything that will make him feel better about it. Gets mad that I never say the 'right' things, which makes the situation worse. I try to tell him its his OCD and we need to break down this issue, its not his fault, this doesn't always work (maybe 10%) of the time. He continues to be emotionally abusive and I have to ask him to leave. He then gets terribly upset because he loves me and doesn't want to feel rejected and wants to stay, but he can't because at this time he cannot control the terrible things he says.
It literally kills me inside to see him saying these things and be in the mental anguish of fighting his own brain/thoughts on a daily schedule. We both agree he is not this malicious man that his OCD makes him. He truly is so supporting and brings out the best in me and I understand this OCD turns him into a dr. jecklle/hyde situation. How do I deal? What do I say to him? How long will it take for this to get better? I don't want to break up, but this is killing me. Need some reassurance myself...

"Hello all,
I have not needed to write on here as my OCD is manageable, and has been for a while.
However my father is a problem. I have been staying at my family home for 2 years and that in itself is not a problem, my mum is great and I am busy working at a workshop in the day or gardening for people, I do not ask for reassurance and am not displaying any difficult behaviour, (just wanted to clear that up in case anyone thinks that the problem is me being at home, in fact my mum has said that it is better with me being around as it is someone who can see my dads moods and behaviour.
ok my dad
My dad is 63 and has always been anxious, asking my mum for reassurance all his life, he took early retirement at 49 and they moved to devon. In that time he has had odd behaviour like not letting the family go out in our car as the tyres were """"""""nearing"""""""" their legal tread, not illegal but nearing. Or if there are workmen down our lane he would worry that they may see that our septic tank is not as it should be """"""""although it is"""""""" and report him, or not letting me have a bath when I had been working on the car when we were all going out for a family meal because a shower was cheaper (no disscussion purely reaction at the very moment that you plan to have one) so wrecking the whole weekend.
Any job he has done he has worried about it excessively that as an engineer if it is windy then his structures will blow down and he will be responsible. It is odd as he can't handle the what if's but if there is a real emergency he will react with almost amazing resolution, one in particular that springs to mind is he had done a general first aid course at work, then a few months after was in a traffic jam when someone said is there anyone who knows first aid, he went forward and started giving this chap CPR when a nurse came over and said that he was dead as half his head had gone, now this he has never had nightmares or flashbacks or every said that it has affected him at all. now this was many many years ago and im not mentioning it because it is relavent and that he has PTSD but because it is things such as a crack in the corner of a window at home that he will worry about and have sleepless nights over as in his mind it would mean the house might fall down.
ok so that is the background
ok so 4 months ago he started driving a ring and ride bus as a part time job, which started off fine doing 15 hours a week. He then complained that he wanted more hours and finally 5 weeks ago got 37 hours a week.
Since then he has started to go into work before it is light to """"""""check the bus over before he drives it"""""""" , now the other drivers do this but it only takes 5-10 mins however he is getting into work at 6 and checking it for 50 mins before anyone else is there so he can check it and he will not miss anything as the other drivers might chat to him and make his miss something.
He says he enjoys the job but does not enjoy home and always comes home and goes to bed at 930 or earlier. He will not look my mum in the eye and is not interested in anything apart from telling us a minute by minute account of who got on the but and who got off.
He says he is unhappy at home because both my mum and me do not adhere to any of his rules in the house, which consist of shutting the door to upstairs and so letting the cats upstairs, and also sitting on a chair if my trousers look dirty but in actual fact are not. He says that no one thinks he has a problem and he is happy but then contradicts this by saying he is not happy at home.
Since things are bad he is sleeping in the spare room so he is not disturbed for his bus job, I went to the doctors and told the doctor about him to which the doctor said to tell him that he wanted to see him. I told my father this and he said that there is nothing wrong with him and it is everyone elses problem.
Help am I going mad as well as my mum and everyone that knows him being concerned or what
what can we do if he will not go and see the doctor and if he is prepared that family life falls apart because he wants to put his bus job before anything else, all he does is eat sleep and driver the bus, he has a good pension from being a bt engineer for 26 years and so the money is not critical for his health.
help
advice please

"Hi I am new to the forum and wanted some advice on OCD and If i have the condition because my doctor thinks I have. I am very frightened by my thoughts and wondered if someone can help me.
I had a difficult childhood moving around and various problems (bedwetting at the age of eleven). i developed thoughts of constant ugliness as a teenager and during nursing training, I would constantly check mirrors all day. i started going to the gym three times a day to stop the negative thoughts and i had a breakdown after nursing training and started pulling out my hair. I have had thoughts before of having AIDS and rang up the Give Blood Helpline to check if I could be contaminated and if they would be able to find out. i have thought I had breast cancer and skin cancer before and been to the doctors to make sure i was okay. i have phoned doctors about five times in one day before during a bad period.
I was raped after nursing and started getting strange thoughts of blame and guilt. I then started checking things on the internet and if I found a word i didn't like i would have to look into it. At the moment I have a thought I left a patient in the bath and that is why he died after going on my break but I knew that if i did anything wrong logically there would have been an enquiry.
When my son was born I had strange thooughts of stabbing him with a knife and yesterday i had a thought of beating him up really badly. I don't perform rituals but I feel really tired and depressed with all this. I am a good person and was a good nurse so why is this happening to me. please can someone help or does anyone relate to this.

well i dont really know how to start but i guess i will have to try. just wanna cry though really. My anxiety is so so overwelming that i cannot even begin to think straight and feel like my mind is about to explode but i donno how to stop. I am so worried that someone has done something to the house eg put something in the drinks in the fridge or on the seats and am struggling to even sit down and when i do sit down all i can think about is what someone might have done to it and keep checking and checking. The only place i feel ok is my room as i know noone has gone in it without me and my mum in there.There is a particular person i am worried about doing this but i dont really want to go into that. This thing i just said about is only one of many other rituals i have to do. I kindof feel like a an loosing myself again to my anxiety and that im lossing control of my mind. I am really scared of slipping back and dont want to go back to how i was in 2010 when i had a 7 mounth inpaient admission and how i was at the beginning of last year when i had a severe relapse. I can feel myself getting worse though and have panic attacks like everyday and at the moment everytime i go out i get so anioxus that i feel like i am going to faint so i have to either sit down like straight away or leave. I also feel really angry with everything and was sat in a cmht appoinment yesterday and said i just feel like punching a wall and ended up feeling overwelmed with panic again. I dont think i want to be dead but just sometimes feel i would be better of dead so i did not have to feel so anoxius any more or feel angry or depressed anymore.

"I've had ocd since childhood. I think it's been getting more severe since then. It all started with contamination fears toward my two sisters. They did not wash their hands after using the bathroom and this disgusted me to the point I haven't hugged or even touched them/let them touch me or my things in 10 years. In the past year many more symptoms have evolved, including washing hands for an hour every time I use the bathroom. This isn't about contamination though. It's about the feeling of the water being sticky. I hate that sticky feeling and I've grown to fear water and soap. Soap is the worst. I imagine the soap sticking to my skin. I've nearly thrown up from the anxiety of soap and sticky water. I take a half hour shower and when I get out I have to touch my skin with wet paper towels for hours on end because its sticky. I can now only stomach 2-3 showers a week. In the past few months I've seemed to develop noise sensitivity. When a hear a noise I have to repeat a ritual. I've started hearing noises that are very small like the creak of a house or the sounds of wet hair against skin. There are many more rituals but too many to post here. What kind of ocd is this?

"Hiya,
Where do i start?
I wish i knew i really do.
Bascially 4 days ago i got stuck on one of my really important rituals and i eventually stopped and accepted that i had not dun it perfect but it was """"""""ok"""""""" i was in a bad state of anxiety that night and took some Diazepam it helped me alot and after a hour i felt calm and relaxed and my mind went pretty much blank of thoughts and worry for the rest of the evenin i felt bit dazed but slept well. I then woke up 2 feelin like hell the anxiety was unbearable as i cud not stop thinkin bout the ritual i felt i had not dun 100% perfect the day b 4 and i felt a intense urge 2 do it agen i felt so anxious my body jerked with anxiety
However i resisted goin back 2 the ritual as my partner said i must not go back 2 it i must let go and move on otherwise i will b feedin my OCD and in OCD's eyes i will never do my rituals 100% right as OCD will always find a fault wiv every ritual and always respond with but what if.
So i decided to ride it out and go thru the intense anxiety hopin i wud cum out the other side feelin better after a few days. Anyways day 2 and i felt more anxious than day 1 worryin sum kind of powers will punish me or take over me or bad things will happen 2 me and other people cause i did not do the ritual 100% perfect. Anyways i told myself 2 days of resistin this ritual i CANNOT give up now i will not let OCD beat me so i kept reassurin myself and usin diazepam 2 help me cope.
Day 3 and my anxiety reached a serious peak i felt so anxious like i was goin 2 die or go crazy or loose touch with reailty but i still refused 2 give in 2 doin this ritual tellin myself its bin 3 days i have cum so far. My partner told me if i give up now it is like startin from scratch agen and i will b reinforcin my OCD.
Day 4 and i felt a bit better at the start of the day but this evenin my anxiety has got bad again all cause i keep thinkin bout this ritual from 4 days ago. Once agen on the diazepam but near 2 runnin out of it and i know it can turn addictive so i dont want 2 live on it. I am also on Buspirione but not enough of it but i cant talk 2 my shrink bout it until the 6th sept i dunno if i can hold on 2 then i am findin life hard and feel i need medication badly.
It is day 5 2 morrow of resistin this ritual and i just wanna know when i can 4 get it and move on? i mean is it normal for people with OCD 2 worry about a ritual they did 5 days ago? i worry i have sum rare illness or that i am sczhiophrenic.
I am so scared that bad things will happen 2 me or i am bein watched and will get punished 4 not doin this ritual 100%.
Do i just keep resistin or repeat it 2 relieve my anxiety and do the ritual?
so confused and scared.
sum 1 please give me sum advice

"Heya all I just wanted to say hi to everyone before I start.
So basically I need some advice from you guys because yall are experts. About 2 yrs ago I was put in a situation where I was forced to give sex to somebody that I didnt want to since then I have had an extreme fear of HIV. Ive had 3 tests in the last yr all negative but Im seriously worried about it. Recently its been gettin worst. Last night I cut myself by accident and the look of my own blood made me vomit and feel extremely faint. Even the color red makes me feel funny. When I went to collect my test results in the waiting room all I could do was cry and was shaking I couldnt even breathe properly. Its so bad that I havent had sex for 9 months, the last time I did I had a panic attack so now I just think its not worth the hastle. I told my mum but she thinks that everyone is somewhere on the OCD spectrum and its nothing to worry about- but it is because I cant have sexual relationships with the boys I like!
Over the summer I worked in a bar and it got so bad that I had to wear gloves at the bar for fear of touching the glasses with saliva on. My boss didnt like me wearing them but I wouldnt work if I didnt wear them. There was a few fights at the bar and blood on the pillars and I felt faint and sick and wouldnt go anywhere near it. I started washing my hands a lot too. Now I have anti bacterial wash and wash my hands about 7 times a day. If I go out I wont touch my face for fear of the germs. I really don't know if this is right and no one seems to understand how scared of AIDS I am. I wont touch homeless people because I think they may have it and even people that are bald and look ill. I would just like some advice thats all. But please dont suggest drugs because I dont agree with them.

"I can’t stop washing my hands and worrying about germs. There are some times when I think I could ‘get away’ without washing them, but I always seem to end up doing it anyway.
Today I was in the High Street, shopping with my mum. I got very anxious and upset as she was walking nearer bins, lampposts and other contaminated things than I felt comfortable with. I really wanted to say something like “mind that signpost”, “watch out for that dog mess,” etc but managed to resist. I know it would be selfish of me to try and persuade her to give into my beliefs. However, that didn’t stop it from making me feel awful, and I’m sure she might have brushed past a few of these things :eek: (which obviously didn’t help.)
Then we went to see the Psychiatrist – again this was very hard for me. I have my “special” route for going there (to try and avoid things I don’t like seeing) but there comes a point where everything is just dirty along that route. Today, there were 2 stains on the bridge (big stains) which obviously looked like someone had thrown up. Yuk! And then sitting down on one of the chairs at the appointment made me feel very uncomfortable too.
Anyway, the Psychiatrist took notes – as they do – and asked how things were. My mum said things were really bad and that both parents are really worried about me. So they were trying to persuade me to go for an examination at a hospital tomorrow. But I honestly can’t see what good it will do. Plus I have loads of college work to catch up on, so I don’t really want to get any further behind (exam in January.) They know what the problem is. The thing that’s really scaring me is that I would have to stay at the hospital for a couple of days. I don’t mind going just for a check-up, but I couldn’t stay in there for any longer. I wouldn’t be able to eat anything there and I’d also be worried about catching something from staying there.
I just want all this to go away. I want OCD to leave me alone, and I wish I had the strength to fight it.","['washing hands', 'hopping', 'OCD']",[],"['hopping', 'OCD', 'washing hands']",,1.0,,,
"Hi,
I'm going to try and condense this down so it's quite short but please read and please help.
I've never questioned my sexuality at all, ever since I was a little kid I always took to girls and wanted to grow up to have a wife and kids for as long as I can remember
I don't know what brought this on but recently I have been doubting this. The doubting period used to last a couple of days and then go away, but recently it's been lingering and it's causing me to feel unbeliveably depressed within myself. Realistically, I know I'm not gay. I don't have a problem with gay people at all. I've currently got a girlfriend who I met at uni and I love her so much. I get butterflies in my stomach when we meet up ect. One night after Easter drinks round a friends house, we came back and began to get up to stuff, but I couldn't get an errection. I left her house the next morning and I was destrought with myself.
To reassure myself I;
Watch porn, discuss endlessly in my own head why I'm not gay, I repeat things to myself in my head, avoid people i know to be gay, and I go on these forums lookin up like-wise symptoms.
Recently aswell, I have noticed that I'm not attracted to guys at all. But when I leave a social situation my mind will throw images at me that my body gets excited to and they are to do with guys. I hate these thoughts. I know I'm straight but these thoughts just make me doubt myself so much. But these experiences still come and go, one day I will wake and be thinking of girls, my girlfriend and this will make me so happy/excited ect. This is regarded a good day. Other days are like how I previously explained. I hate bad days. I fear going to sleep because I feel my mind isn't garded and these thoughts will return. This just gets me tired and then I feel that my brains defences against these thoughts are weakened. It's crazy I know.
I've always felt like I've had slight OCD, washing my hands, locking doors and then trying the handle like a billion times to make sure it's locked, certain electrical switches must be turned off, ect.
I love it, I've said I would keep it short but this turning into an essay. To clarify;
I love my girlfriend, I love the female anatomy and love looking at them.
Get horrid thoughts that sometimes excite me, then I wish would go. I don't associate myself with wanting these thoughts at all and defonatly don't want to live them.
Dont find guys attractive

"This post continues from my last post about worrying i said or tried to say something bad outloud to do with religion when i desperately didnt want to. I really need some help 
Please can anyone relate to feeling so close to acting. Picturing doing it, then feeling like they were dared to by ocd, and then worry they did? Its like i was on the edge and became not so careful like i was numb, pushed into a Strange state where im usually so careful.
Bear with me, i was getting a bad thought, i realised i couldnt stop this, so i felt like i was gonna start fresh and accept that, so immediately i remembered reading about a person """"""""speaking under their breath and not sure if they said it"""""""" and felt relief that i wasnt gonna be like them at least.
So with this new """"""""safe"""""""" feeling i let myself listen to ocds ideas...knowing id be ok, i remember like when you go into a deep thought about something...and then i also remember sort of snapping out for a second thinking and reminding myself this would 'normally worry me' but i know nothing has happened , i even replayed it all to be sure and i was happy because i knew all was 'safe' there was no reason to panic, i felt ok, maybe slight anxiety but ok, i then stopped all concentration and continued with what i was doing and felt myself push out breath, that was when it hit me. All the other Little moments were picturing my mouth moving but knowing nothing had been said for sure (this is what i worry about...why did i even move my mouth or kind of let myself be on the edge) But this time i had actually let breath out, and felt a push because i was picturing my mouth making a letter at the time, thats when i shot up and suddenly felt like the thought became an action and that i was evil. It was about not knowing if it slipped out, under literally 'breath', i hear breath and freaked out. None of this was planned, i never wanted to speak, my mind was just deep into imagining it and because i felt safe/numb i didnt panic and then the moment doubt came in i freaked and heard breath, felt breath and a push of breath. Thats the real memory. Its revisiting it that has made me blow up every single part of it and added more and more.
I only panicked when i heard breath therefor anything before it wasnt even breath it was all either moving Mouth and hearing it in my head but not doing anything to make me think id spoke. It was the breath that did it. And then i Suddenly felt a massive surge of anxiety and shock panic disgrace, a HUGE SPIKE because i felt the moments before it i had time to change but i didnt. I let myself react thats why. I even within al this thought """"""""dont even think it in full its like saying it in your head"""""""" and to my surprise my head silenced for once.
Why am i now Carrying this guilt, why didnt i not react. Why did i even for 2-3 seconds picture it and move my mouth, and why did i let it become so real and full of doubt at the same time.
Its like as soon as i discover another possible worry within moments i have that worry! I cant just be free i am constantly getting new worries ive never not had a worry.
For once i was trying to be 'normal' or 'rational' and thought ocd cannot get me this time, i had no intentions of doing wrong it was the last thing i ever wanted and BOOM it got me. Trapped me. Tested me and i feel i failed. If im not 100% careful and aware i fail.
Can anyone please help me get my life back instead of feeling im evil and have this huge secret and i am unforgiven. Please. I am so broken.

"Hi
Im changing meds and i have come off prozac from 60MG to nothing in 3 weeks (doctor adivce not mine) and i was doing so well i was feeling confident. I still had bad thoughts but was handling them so much easier. My main OCD is POCD and i have had this over my husbands son who was 12 when we met but is now 18 so you would wonder why i still have this form of OCD over him. Anyway my OCD thoughts have revolved around him over the last week as he has been on his first lads holiday abroad and everyone has been joking about what he will be up to while he is away, but like i said i have handled the thoughts well. BUT 2 nights ago i was watching the video to the song take my breath away on u tube as i had heard it during the day at work and remembered i liked it. I was watching it and was comparing the love story part to me and my husband and it was lovely. It then came to the sex scene part and again i was thinking of me and my husband and it was getting butterflies in my tummy when all of a sudden i imagained my step son and that this is prob what he would have been doing on holiday and the excited butteryflies feeling really increased and i paniced cos it felt like i was getting the feeling over the thought of my step son having sex!! i stopped the video and i have not been able to stop rumniating since and im upset cos i was doing so so well, deep down i know its just and OCD Spike but i keep checking back to remeber exactly how i felt and it is just making it worse, i have even wacthed the video again to recheck and it is literally a 10 second scene that has caused this and im trying to remember each second and how it turned from something innocent to something horrible and my exact feelings.
I have started my new meds yesterday im hoping these start working quickly!!! i know i shouldnt be looking for reassuarnce but i need it this time is this just my OCD trying to beat me?

"hello,
i'm new to this site and would like to just get my story of ny chest and basically see if anyone has experienced similar things.
i feel i have been an anxious person my whole life but recently after years of smoking weed and other occasional drug use i have had bouts of serious anxiety. i have stopped all the weed and drugs naturally but am now going through a really terrible time. After suffering from real bad anxiety a few months ago i have somehow convinced myself that i am developing schizophrenia. i have spent hour and hours researching symptoms then checking or testing myself to see if i have them, its horrible, i am always expecting to start hearing voices or hallucinating or getting paranoid delusions. i have sat and stared at things waiting for them to move and on occasion i have found that when i stare at something for ages without blinking it seems like my vision around the thing starts to distort or go weird, this has frightened me hugely and i am scared of staring at things now. aside from that i have worked through pretty much every symptom and started feeling better realising im probably not going mad and its this constant worrying that is the problem, however, recently i read about psychotic people seeing faces in things and i got hugely freaked out about that and started testing myself to see if i would make out faces in patterns or clouds or whatever, this is ridicoulus i know because i realise if you look at something like a cloud long enough you can probably make out a face but now i cant stop doing it and i freaks me out so much. its so awful i cant stop thinking that this is the start of me becoming paranoid and psychotic or maybe i already have and what im doing is part of it. im so fed up of this, i am seeing a counsellor and she suggested cbt or group therapy but wont reassure me that im not going mad as she says its not what she is supposed to do, she is only there to suggest ways of helping myself. i find this pretty unhelpful actually. i have started getting panic attacks again and find it harder and harder to reassure myself that this is just some form of anxiety disorder. i sometimes get strange what if thoughts like what if i start thinking someones reading my mind, then i get really upset that i thought that in the first place.... i also sometimes get thoughts of violent things or me hurting someone and i am so scared of them. i am not a violent person at all. i am also petrified of having my drink or food spiked, which i knew is hugely irrational and stupid or paranoid but i still worry about it and feel uncomfortable getting drinks from someone i dont know very well or i havent seen carrying the drink the whole time.
ok im sorry for rambling but i feel so hopeless and scared sometimes and its difficultt talking to people about this. Has anyone experienced this sort of thing? Does it sound like an anxiety disorder, the first signs of psychosis or both?

"Hi,I am new here and am not sure how the forum works, I have just poseted in """"""""introduce yourself"""""""" but not sure how viewed that is.


I have suffered with OCD for the last twenty years but this time it has got me beaten.

My latest manifestation of this is the sexual orientation variety after the previous health and harm usual suspects.

The problem this time is that I have an incident from when I was a teenager to reinforce the feelings and that is a killer.


I have just started with a CBT therapist but I cannot do the exposure therapy. My sexual thoughts don't cause a spike at the moment, they happen, I try to ignore them and let them wash over me but it only seems to reinforce the feelings that I am not reacting to them and that then brings on massive depression. TODAY HAS BEEN HELL.

You see how can I do the exposure therapy when I'm not getting that spike to resist??? If I fill my head with those images I will simply end up going that way totally.

"Sorry I've been posting so much the last few days, I'm feeling really low and it's been really nice being on this forum.
I will have to wait forever for CBT and since my theme is rocd, I need to find a way to deal with it until then (living with my boyfriend). Most of all, I don't want to hurt him and so far I managed to not burden him with this. I know he would understand, but be very hurt (or at least I would be in that situation). I feel constantly sick with anxienty now so basically never feel like sex (which is not like me at all), and I have to hold back tears everytime he tells me he loves me because I feel like a horrible person since all I can think about is is how I don't love him anymore and how I will make us both miserable.
I was fine for a few hours yesterday evening and this morning, but now I want to run for the hills whenever he touches me. And I still freak out about whether this is OCD. Although, whatever it is it isn't normal to be this stressed and depressed all the time.
I don't really know what response I'm looking for...

"Hi everyone
I would really appreciate some advice. My son is 15 and is having CBT but several months on he seems no better if anything he is worse. I'll give you a brief history we had noticed for sometime that things weren't right but just thought it was something he would grow out of. Things finally came to a head in July last year when my grandmother died (she had been ill for some time) . My son had a complete meltdown and said it was his fault she had died because he had to do things to keep everyone safe and he had tried to stop doing them and that is why his great grandma had died. We took him to the gp who referred him to cahms and we finally got an appointment the end of November. We were told they would start 1 to 1 therapy with him and it was totally confidential and we wouldn't be told anything unless his health and well being we're at risk. He has started to open up to us and has stopped hiding a lot of his ocd from us which is great but now it seems he is totally dependant on me or my husband and is constantly seeking reassurance. His symptoms are hand washing as he thinks he will contaminate others if he touches them. He has lots of rituals that he does including dressing and undressing several times before he can dress, repeatedly touching different parts of his body ie he will touch his head then foot then arm and repeat this sequence, back tracking if he is walking and touching things with his foot repeatedly and he is constantly mumbling things to himself and he says he does this to keep us safe and to stop us getting cancer (this is his biggest fear) he will have a meltdown if he hears the word or anything which he associates with it. He tells me all this but when I ask if he tells his therapist he says he can't talk to her like he talks to me and he tells her he is fine when really he isn't.
I don't know what to do for the best as I'm not sure I'm saying or doing the right thing and as we don't get any feedback from his therapist we don't know if what we are doing is working. I'm totally drained I know this was never going to be easy but it is having an impact on the whole family. My other son who is 11 quite often gets the backlash from his brothers outbursts and I also have a 2 year old girl who is a typical toddler tantrums and all.

also i find that if i try and resist one ritual, my ocd tries to make up for it by giving me other rituals to do, it's like i can only resist one thing at a time.

"I had a bad spike on Wednesday, I was at a social gathering and needed to write something down, after writing I turned the paper over and there was, what appeared to be, blood on the other side. I had my baby on my knee at the time and was freaked out I had 'contaminated' him.
I got home and told my husband what had happened, and he suggested we use a cbt method which my therapist had taught me to use, which is like this
Chance it was blood 1/50 (it either was or it wasn't)
Chance it was HIV infected 1/1000 (average % of people with HIV)
Chance it was still alive 1/1000 (quite sure it was dry)
Chance it got onto me/baby 1/50 (either did or didn't)

"Hi
If anyone can help me, this would be much appreciated, I really don't know what to do. I have suggested counselling but my fiance has turned me down.. here is the issue, if ANYONE can help or refer me to sites this would help me a lot..
Anyway, my fiance and I have been together for over 5 years. When we first moved in together (about 4 years ago..) i noticed something was not quite right. He was always very security conscious and worried about my personal security (he always always worried about me getting run over by a car, cars seem to be one of him main worries, he can't drive). I assumed it was a mild form of OCD (checking security, gas hobs etc..) but it never really affected our lives, so this is not why I am worried. Anyway, one night he had a particularly bad day at work, and all I could hear (I was in bed) was banging downstairs.. Turns out when he feels that people are being mean to him, he bangs walls. He started off banging his head, but now thankfully we managed to get him off that and banging his fists.
I honestly thought the problem was under control.. stupid me.. he was quite good at hiding it.. Anyway, I found some very graphic porn websites on his laptop, so I confronted him about it (I don't mind men watching porn, but the general theme was female submission and violence, which I don't like). That's when it all came out.. He had never stopped banging (even though he repeatedly told me he had) goes into a small room (our small toilet for guests) and bangs away.. He does this a few times a day, always after he gets a thought in his head about someone being mean to him (he has just left a job where one of his bosses shouted at him, and he can't forget about that), but he may also start thinking about incidents years ago when someone treated him unfairly. He looks at this porn, not because allegedly he enjoys it, but because it makes him forget about things.. Over the years the images have got worse, to what they are now.
He also said that he has never been fully happy, and this coupled with the OCD is making him always miserable. Luckily, there are no suicidal thoughs..
Any ideas?","['flatulence', 'checking', 'toilet', 'joy', 'Suicidal', 'OCD', 'site', 'Thought']",['theme'],"['flatulence', 'OCD', 'site', 'checking', 'joy', 'toilet', 'Thought', 'theme', 'Suicidal']",1.0,,,,
"Hey everyone,
I will make this short. I just saw this website and was excited there was somewhere to go and talk.
Well, I have struggled with OCD my entire life. Pure O to be exact. I had my first real SPIKE about 6 years ago and only had 1 or 2 hard core spikes since. Lately I been going through a ton of life stresses. Broke up with a girlfriend of ten years and moved into a new place. Also a ton of other things I wont bore you with. But I am 36 and have been dealing with this since I was 10 so I think it is time I try something. I have not gone to a therapist yet but if I cant do this on my own I will look into it.

Basically, I just recently realized what specific form of Pure O that I have. Its called emotional contamination. From what I was told, this is what it is. Lets say you sat in a chair that a gay guy sat in or a pedophile. You would fear that you would catch gay or pedophilia.

My OCD centers around sickos like serial killers. If a weird thought pops into my head I have to neutralize the thought with another thought or series of thoughts to feel the anxiety ease and feel like myself again.

So, the emotional contamination I have isnt about physically being in contact with something because its all in my head with thoughts. But the same principle. Like if a thought pops in my head that I am in a killers house or wearing cloths I saw them wear on a tv interview that I accidentally saw, I will freak out and have to cancel the thoughts. If any of this makes sense.

Anyway, lately I have been doing well with letting the thoughts be there and trying to not do rituals....

The other day I was at the dentist and he was fixing my teeth cosmetically and the moment he finished with his tool I thought of something bad. It has been driving me crazy all week. I can very easiy go back to him and have him do something again, since it is cosmetic I could just say I want it more this way or that way and he will subtly change it. But I want to keep the anxiety and let it pass so I can finally get over this. I guess it is almost like ERP. It has been a week and it is all I can think about. I know all I have to do is go back and make sure I think good thoughts right before he finishes and I will be GOLDEN... Better then golden.. I will be on top of the world. I am sure you know what I mean. when you finally get that relief you are looking for you become high with life and enjoyment. Color comes back into your world. It is short lived of course, but you can move on.

Anyway, I feel like I have this itch that I cant scratch now. I am on vacation from work next week and I cant get excited for it because this is all I can think about. I just want to go back to the dentist so bad and get that good feeling when I complete the ritual... (although there is always the chance I can make it wiorse. I can think of something even more horrible and then be screwed... Almost like if I try to hard to think of good thoughts it will make it that much harder to think good thoughts.. if you know what I mean)

So here is what I am asking.. Although I am sure I know what everyone will say....

Should I continue to go on with this horrible anxiety and try to push through it? Or should I go back to the dentist, for no reason other then get another shot at completing my ritual?

I know in the short run if I get the ritual right I will be on top of the world... But in the long run it isnt helping me. But maybe I just need to feel better this one last time and start smaller... THIS IS KINDA ONE OF THE WORSE CASE SCENARIOS for me. Its a teeth thing, which I am hugely anal about. It is something I cant easily do a ritual for because I have to go to a dentist to complete it. ETC...

Basically I thought of a serial killer right before he finished my tooth. So now I feel like I am contaminated with his weird sicko essence or something. I just want to go and think of something or someone good so I can feel like myself again....

I know this is completely ridiculous and makes no sense and its just stupid thoughts. Believe me I know this. lol... But... OCD is like... hmmmm,,, but what if.... You know.

Does any of this make sense?
I just want tio feel like myself again and I cant with this annoying itch that wont go away. Its been almost a week and its actually getting stronger, not lessoning. For year I have been saying, Okay this is the last ritual then I am going to power through not doing them anymore. But I always say, one more time. this one isnt a good one to go out on. As strange as that sounds.. So this is a pretty set in stone one. I can say my last ritual was this tooth right here. But, its SOO hard. I just want to go back and get that good feeling of feeling like me mentally, physically, emotionally and spiritually. But right now I feel gross and weird and anxious and UGH! just not myself at all. Like 180 degree difference..

I suffer from OCD and currently in therapy. However, the rumination aspect of OCD has not been something that has caused me too much trouble. Well until now...
I started to obsess over a certain topic, a topic that I won't be able to get an answer to for over a week. It's been driving me nuts and I don't have any coping methods to deal with this aspect of OCD.

"Hello,
I had a spike this morning and it's making me feel pretty low. If I treated a child the same way I treated my dog I would have been absolutely vilified, what's the difference? I badly impacted on her life, I smacked her (daily, several times maybe too hard) and didn't give her things that she needed ie, regular walks.
:crybaby:
""""""""Sorry for posting once again with my problems with no answers. Its the dog issues again, feeling very bad about smacking her (small little Yorkie) and making her more submissive than the average dog, eg, put ears down when you called her name, avoided eye contact, lowered her head when you went to stroke her, approached you with a bit of a lowered body. I feel what I did was excessive, smacked her on a daily basis, probably several times and probably too hard. Plus her lack of regular walks added to her misery.
I know I was a child/young teen and everyone makes mistakes but I just can't cope with what I did.

I've been told that if you were attracted to children, you wouldn't have to check to know, you would just know. And I had to keep looking at her legs to test if I was attracted or not. I don't understand why I would've thought this. Such a weird thought. I haven't thought this about every child I've looked at. I do not to my knowledge have any sexual interest in children, but why would I have thought such a thing.
Do I attach significance to it or just leave it and treat it as an unwanted thought? Surely it doesn't correlate to actually having any attraction to children or this particular child?

"Hi,
I can hardly bare to be awake coz the anxiety in my stomach is painful. A literal pain.
I will be brief. Note that I see a psychiatrist every 2 weeks, but I can't wait til the 14th Jan.
- I felt hetero as a kid, with crushes on girls. I developed gay fears/realization from age 14 after some gay dreams, arousals and """"""""attractions"""""""". It put me off dating girls for fear of misleading her, etc. I would ruminate 24/7 and felt suicidal.
- From age 19ish, when I finally got into porn (I was feeling more """"""""bisexual possibly"""""""" at this time), I noticed the women were submissive and a fear/jealousy of female- and a disappointment in male-sexuality developed. (Men - dominant, women - sumbissive) I fell into the woman category.
- Around the same time, I developed a fear of anal sex (be it men or women) because my mind said """"""""if they like it, you will with men"""""""". So that became another OCD with panics if I saw porn and didn't have time to analyse it first, or someone mentioned anything connected to this form of sexual behaviour.
- Age 23, I """"""""came out"""""""" to see if that was the problem. It didn't help. Later, I heard some info about the male prostate gland, and I had a huge panic attack and ended up in mental hospital. Chest pain. Sleepless nights. Long story short a nurse told me something that de-associated it with """"""""gays"""""""".
- Age 25, met a girl. Great relationship, except nervous about sex, performance anxiety, rumintion. When that improved, I began to focus on her sense of enjoyment compared to my own (100x more). I began to compare male and female sexuality. It PANICKED ME when she mentioned her erogenous zones, love of intimacy etc. I felt so low, cried at work, and got in touch with an NHS mental health team. I split with the girl for issues over her kid. But for a long time, the gay OCD/gayness had faded away, replaced by female sexuality OCD. I needed to counteract """"""""female's unlimited pleasure"""""""" - I had now embraced the very prostate info that had landed me in hospital. It made things seem fairer. Oddly.
- This Xmas, I was watching porn. I won't go into depth, but it appears that there are more types of pleasure women can have. So my mind is telling me that I will probably need a MAN, because a girl won't do certain things to a man[/b]. Also, I have read that women can have more types of orgasm compared to men.
I have such anxiety in my chest that I cant do anything. I just feel like my sex has limited me to a certain amount of pleasure, and only certain types of pleasure, lest I start sleeping with men. I am ok with prostate concern now. This helps my with the """"""""female sexuality OCD"""""""" + the woman decoupled it from homosexuality - that helped me get over the fear and be ok with it. But I know no girl is gonna want to have anything to do with me if she finds that out. So my mind says: """"""""simple: do it with guys"""""""".
I really thought that during mid 2009 that I was improving. But now Im sat here holding my stomach coz of the anxiety. I don't want mum to know I am feeling like **** because she will just get mad at me. I dont know what to do. Every other time that I've spiked, some """"""""counteractive"""""""" info would help minimize the spike, but on this one, I am on my own. :( I wanna cry.
I accepted that I could be bisexual a long time ago (even tho I still had gay fears/OCD). I just can't deal with the spiking.
Sorry for venting.

"Hi guys
Someone please tell me what is happpeining!
Ive had ocd at least 7 years Ive had the classic ocd washing hands for 5 years and that was when they diagnsed it...when i took sertriline about 1 and a half years ago my ocd changed and it has become more pure o than hand washing rituals. Strangely I found this harder because eith this I couldnt just wash the anxiety away i had to tackle it from inside... the difference with this is that before although I was hand washing I at least had epsioses after each wash where the anxiety elevated for a time...with the type I have now its just thoughts and they tend to be more aware of the anxiety although I cope quite well with the thoughts by touching and repeating words to counteract the negative thought ...
Well lately I have really been fighting this demon and the motivation is to get well as I have recently moved and want to get a new job... my family miss me and only yesterday i visted and returned home in the same day i was exhausted... still I have noticed when exhausted i dont have the energy to deal with ocd so I dont but it causes anixety and i have thought lately i am getting better cos I hadnt been letting ocd get the better of me.
since then Im staying a wake more and Im getting hot and cold chills.. this morning i felt so bad i took a tranquilizer cos i stopped my meds a bout a month ago I took sertriline it made me feel worse and then librium after i gave it a rest inbetween.
I didnt get OCd that I could seee was ocd until i was 33 I remember feeling normal although ive always been hypersensitive.
Can anyone tell me why i am feeling like this... why is this so hard to budge...ive had cbt and meds and nows its just me fighting it ..iguess this is the fitrst time ive really been desparate to get rid of it.

"Hi
Most of you i think know about my husband Marc, but a brief story for those who dont - he had checking ocd since he was 8, its now 29 years later, when our daughter was born it morphed into paedophile ocd, and focused on her. He is on venlafaxine and we are currently waiting for a referral back to the psychiatrist to change meds (hes been on them for 5 years) and a re-referall for cbt. He had cbt with a really good therapit but she left, he had a breakdown, then he was assigned to a different psychologist who did things differently, he didnt like her and didnt trust her, so he refused to go and dropped out of the system.
We have hit rock bottom again, he gets the thoughts all the time, and even though we have talked through the four steps, he thinks its too long to go through, and isnt working for him, if he does the rituals 'right' he can have a couple of days where it doesnt affect him too badly, but then it comes back with a vengeance.
It is really affecting him at work now, and it didnt before, he has a responsibilty part of his ocd, where if he doesnt go to work he panics and hates taking time off sick, so when he comes home the ocd is relentess, and he often will go upstairs to bed because he feels safe there and then isnt able to leave the bed. He gets the irrational thought, then has to do the mental ritual, and then promises on our lives (mine and my daughter) that he wont do it again - i have told him hes putting too much pressure on himself, and hes absolutely convinced if he doesnt do the ritual something will happen to our daughter.
We are trying out a different strategy where he delays doing the ritual by a couple of minutes after the initial 'spike'. Does anyone else have any advice, i know the referrals will take some time to come through, last time we waited over a year for cbt.
sorry for such a long post!!

"Hello, I'm glad I found people who I can share my experiences with because my life is getting worse and worse.
I'm a 25 years old guy, I dont care about germs or getting sick at all, only the fact that i can get in touch with my own or someone else's urine/feces makes me feel crazy, dirty and uncomfortable....Every single day i become obssesed with a specific thought, for example....I was in my car the other day with a friend...my car was parked beside a garden and some water splashed on me and my car inside and out...so my friend said: do u know that this water comes from sewage treatment plants? so it's basically toilet water, there's probably urine in it....now every time I'm in the car i feel uncomfortable....I feel bad whenever i see it, also my walet, my phone and everything else that water splashed on. I cannot get that thought out of my head and it's driving me crazy. I just wish I was one of those guys that don't care at all and continue with their day like nothing happened.
i shower twice a day, cannot pee standing so urine doesnt splash on me, can't touch Anything after touching my penis because in my head there's urine on it as a result of pee drops....I never find any wetness in my boxers but everday whenever i feel a movement or wetness downthere my day is ruined because i keep thinking i peed myself a little. I know urine is Not going to negatively effect my life but i hate the fact that my body or my stuff (phone, watch, wallet, car etc) can get urine on them. I would wash my hands every time I shake hands with drunk people in clubs because they probably went to the toilet without washing hands.
I keep trying to remind myself that the world is full of dirt and filth and there's absolutely no way to avoid getting in contact with it....but it's not working, i threw away lots of stuff just because i suspect that they where touched by someone that doesnt wash hands after going to the bathroom.
I threw away my bag once because someone placed it on a rug where a cat peed on like 3 years ago! every time I look at the bag I remember where it was placed and I had to throw it away because I can't use it anymore.
any thoughts on this? especially about the car incident coz its what's on my mind at the moment lol

Im sorry if im going over and over the same theme i just want to feel better again, i came home during my dinner hour today and bawled my eyes out because i just want to feel better again and im scared i will be stuck like this. Im waiting for c.b.t and have also put my name down on No panics one to one mentoring list which should come through in about 4-6weeks.
When i have the horrible thought that it doesnt seem real/rational to notice as many coincidences as i do then i get a flash of panic which makes me feel more unreal and so the cycle continues. i spoke to a lady today on a helpline for no panic and she wasnt very helpful, didnt seem to understand or no of anyway to help me so that didnt help. I no i shouldnt look for reassurance but im struggling to stay convinced that my ocd is tricking me and making things appear differently with the coincidences. Please can someone tell me theyve had this issue as bad as me and got better because im scared. I cannot look at the issues ive had with coincidences and not feel anxious.

Hey everyone. Sorry to bother you guys again this week. But my ocd is having a field day this week. One theme after another. I was just curious to know can the news (such as tv news and newspapers) trigger panic and anxiety in someone with a particular ocd theme? Can this happen with ocd?,"['anxiety', 'anxiety', 'OCD']",['theme'],"['theme', 'anxiety', 'OCD']",1.0,,,,
"Hi there,
I wonder if anybody can relate to this, help me.
I do apologize for the long post, but it's a bit of a long story.
Here it is:
I've had pure O ocd for about 20 years now ( I'm nearly 27).
Since the death of my gran in April this year, and after a discussion with a psychology student, I have this fear/ feeling that I will harm the people that I love.
At the time I had NO idea what that was, I've always referred to the problem as """"""""auto-accusations"""""""".
Since I've been 6, it's like"""""""" can you absolutely prove that you are not a paedophile/ lesbian/ murderer/bad person/ugly/too loud,etc.""""""""
Anyway, I saw a mental health worker on 31/05/06...a big day for me because she put a name on my trouble, ie OCD, and i have been reading lots and lots about it and I can really relate to that.
I am on the waiting list for CBT ( 18 months )
Finding out what was wrong with me was the first step towards getting better.
I have read about the first steps, plus an article by DR Philipson ( or is it Stevenson?) and they've helped me tremendously.
Basically I worked very hard on NOT DOING THE COMPULSIVE BEHAVIOUR and there was a massive improvement, so much so that the mental health worker told me two weeks ago that I was fine, and indeed I was feeling much, much better.
In my case, the compulsive behaviours are: confessing, thinking things over until they """"""""feel right"""""""" and analyzing my feelings, and asking for reassurance.
This is precisely why I'm asking you to refrain from reassuring me.
Yes I would feel better if you did, but I know it's only short term.
Anyway, back to my story( if you're not asleep yet )
My mum has bipolar disorder.
It means that she is atrocious to me and my dad.
I know she can't help it, but I know also that when we try to help her she either bites our head off or sys that she refuses to listen- sorry if I sound harsh here, but I think that part of it is that she wants to be like this.
To anyone who takes offence, I want to add that I know someone else with bipolar disorder who is grateful for the help she can get; let me tell you right now that I do not think that people with bipolar disorder feel sorry for themselves; I think that my mum does, but it's down to her personality.
Anyway, last time I went to France she shouted abuse at me ( even when she is not in a temper, she says things to me like: """""""" I wish I had not had you, I was only 20"""""""")
She can be really obnoxious and I've always been there for her in spite of the mental torture she's put us through, because I was always thinking"""""""" it's not her fault"""""""".
Then last week she called me and asked how my """"""""disease"""""""" was ( these were her own words).
I told her that I felt great and that my mental health worker said I did not need to see her.
She then told me that HER doctor reckoned that """""""" I was not right in the head"""""""", that last time she saw me it was obvious that I was """""""" not well at all"""""""" ( Thanks, mum, actually I felt great for the first time in months except when you shouted abuse at me for no reason, it's always nice to hear that people think you look terrible when you're getting better!)
She said that her shouting abuse was """"""""my fault"""""""" , that I was worrying her, that I was taking offence too easily.
Basically, she chose the moment when I felt better to tell me that I was wrong to be optimistic, that it was obvious that I was sick.
Next thing I know she says that she blames herself for my OCD and I try to educate her, telling her that
1) It 's nothing to do with my upbringing
2) OCD is not, as she seems to think, a horrible mental disease that stops me from living my life.
But as soon as I started to READ evidence to her she said that she refused to believe it, that it was horrible and that it was her fault.
Needless to day, my doubts were pretty much back after all this.
On Thursday, my sister called me to say that my mum is going to hospital tomorrow for """""""" mental exhaustion"""""""".I found out that my dad, whom I love to bits, broke down at work and cried because he was so worried ( and probably tired himself because my sister said my mum has been obnoxious to him lately).
The day after I found out my sister went through the same thing at school.
I'm on holiday in 4 weeks so I offered to visit, not only for them but because my mum could do with some support.
My dad and sister were really keen but my mum made it clear that she didn't want to see me.
Last time, as I said, she shouted terrible abuse at me, and she said she didn't want to see me because I would make her angry again.
There's no word to describe how that made me feel.
And then yesterday I had a terrible OCD step back about harming my boyfriend.
It was like being back to square one and it did NOT feel nice, I felt a panick attack coming.
I did what I had to do, ie the four steps, so I refrained from telling him, I acknowledged the terrrible thought but tried not to engage with it, and after less that 1/2 hour I was a lot calmer.
But I am really scared now because I think that it wil come back, and I know that the more I fear it, the more likely it is to happen.
I suppose it's down to the stress I've experienced because of the situation with my mum, but in this instance it doesn't calm me down knowing why it is happening.
So can anyone tell me what to do if the """"""""attacks"""""""" occur again?
Is there a way to sort of """"""""prevent"""""""" them?
Thank you and sorry for the long post

"Hello everyone,
My main manifestation of OCD is false memories/ doubting my memory and I would be really grateful if anyone could give me any advice on this:
I have an appointment to see my GP tomorrow and talk about my issues. I'm hoping to get therapy that will be more tailored to help me overcome my OCD, but have never raised the issue with my GP before. I'm in talk therapy and my therapist, who is a lovely person otherwise, just doesn't know anything about OCD, she thinks I'm making up scenarios that never happened to get attention/ feel special and while I've really tried framing my thoughts that way, I just don't feel it's being helpful.
Now I'm a bit uncertain on how to address my false memory issues with my GP tomorrow. People here aren't exactly knowledgeable about OCD and I know that false memory issues can seem quite strange if you haven't heard or read about them before. My therapist was on the verge of sending me to a hospital, thinking I was delusional when I first talked to her about them. I managed to convince her that it's not really about completely losing my grip on reality, more about having fearful doubts about what might have happened but I'm afraid that I'm not very good at putting this into words, especially when I'm in the middle of a spike. My therapist has made comments about how other professionals other than her might misconstrue my issues as delusions more than once.
So does anyone here have some advice on how to best raise the issue with my GP? I'd really like to be open and brave with her so as to get the best help I can, but I'm also worried about being misdiagnosed. To me, it's absolutely clear that I'm not delusional, but how would you describe the difference between false memories and actual delusions to someone who maybe isn't informed about OCD?
Any help would be great, thank you!

"Hi, I'm new here and I really am so confused! I'm 13 and I don't know if I have OCD or not! I don't wash my hands all the time, and have no problem with germs, but I do have a few symptoms of OCD, like these:
I touch EVERYTHING. If I look at something I have to touch it, but not stupid things, like the sun. If I look at something, like a wall, I would have to get up and touch it. And I don't touch things normally, I touch them in a weird way; I touch things in fours, like I would use all my fingers to touch something and it would go: thumb, 1st finger, 2nd finger, 3rd finger, 4th finger, 5th finger, and then I would do the same but backwards, and backwards again, and then forward again, and then touch all five fingers on the wall at the same time, and then my palm, and the whole front of my hand, and the the back of my hand and my wrist. Sometimes I go extreme and do it all the way up to my shoulder, depending on what I'm wearing. Then I repeat the process with the other hand, and then that hand again, and then the first hand, and then do the whole thing again with both hands at the same time. It's massively time consuming and looks weird, but I have to do it because if I don't then I get all panicked. Depending how I'm feeling I get more nervous. If I'm nervous or sweaty to begin with, I nearly have a panic attack, but if I'm fine first, I get nervous and sweaty. That's the worst thing. I also have to get an equal amount of finger-time on the keys of a keyboard. I would write a sentence with my 1st finger, then 2nd, and so on. (I'm doing it now actually, and I'm shaking because I messed up.)
I have to have perfect grammar, and I'm addicted to commas. I'm not sure if this has anything to do with OCD, but I get the same nervous feeling I get when I don't touch something if I don't put in a comma or I speak or type with bad grammar, I then have to say the whole sentence again, with the correct grammar or type it out again.
If I make a mistake of any kind on the keyboard I have to delete the whole sentence and re-write it perfectly. Sometimes this can go on with one sentence for up to ten minutes.
Everything has to be neat and symmetrical, and in fours when possible.
If there's a some pen left on a whiteboard at school, it has to be rubbed out, or I go into full freak out mode. I know other people without OCD are bothered by that but I full-on freak out.
Lids HAVE to be on pens/bottles/ anything with lids, if not in use.
Cupboards need to be shut.
I check multiple times if a door is shut, or open if there's a cat in the room.
People's collars MUST be proper, not stuck up to their neck.
No hair is allowed on a jacket that shouldn't be there.
I'm not freakily clean, but I do have a method of washing my hands and if I don't they must be dried, then rewashed.
I collect comics, and I am VERY protective of them. They are in perfect sections, in chronological order, and no one can touch them but me, or I get violent. (I'm not kidding.)
I have loads more little things, but I think I have just about covered the worst ones and most unusual.
Please help! It's hell to live with, but if I know it's definitely OCD I can tell my mum, because I'm really shy and awkward about these things, and if I tell her I have OCD and I don't I'll freak the hell out.

"Hi,
This is going to be a very long message I'm afraid! I have OCD worries that I may contract Hepatitis C from contact with blood or semen on a surface. I understand that Hep C can live for a long time in the environment and that even an invisible amount of blood could infect.
Now, from this I have developed all the classic OCD symptoms. I have had OCD for many years, but it used to be centred on religious issues and I managed to pretty much get over that eventually after several years. Anyway, I basically know what to look out for so I know these are OCD type worries about Hep C ! :original:
All pretty standard. I was thinking about trying some CBT to get over this, but there is a bit of a problem and I'm not quite sure how to solve it, or even if I can. The problem is that I have eczema on my hands which I've had for over 20 years. It gets infected at the drop of a hat, every few weeks the eczema would get infected and I would have to use an antibacterial cream from the doctor. My main worry is that if """"""""dirt"""""""" type infections get in there so easily (it's often quite open and bleeds), then presumably things like Hepatitis could also get in there pretty easily. All the research I can find on Hep C, plus advice from doctors suggests that you're unlikely to catch it from a surface, as long as you don't have open cuts or sores. Now, that's the problem for me, I do have open sores that get infected by things like staph infections a lot.
Most of what I have read about CBT for this type of OCD states that it involves exposure to possible contamination, and then not washing, or not being as ridiculously thorough. The trouble is, I really do get infected with things if I don't wash carefully. Since I have become meticulous in washing my hands due to OCD my eczema has in fact got a lot better for the first time in over 20 years. If I start CBT and do not wash as much, things will go back to the way they were and I will be getting infections every few weeks (this part is not OCD, it does happen to me). I suppose I could put up with that, but my worry is that as I am easily infected with things, then by exposing myself to things that could have Hepatitis on them, then I might get that as well, whereas a person with normal skin would not.
CBT seems to be based on doing what people without OCD would do, but what if you really do have more chance of infection than others as would seem to be the case with me? Presumably there must be cases where people really do have to be more careful than others if they have a particular susceptibility.
I really can't see a way out of this for me, since CBT would seem to be risky whereas for the average person it would not be.
Another part of the problem is that I get possibly contaminated things on me quite a lot! The reason for this is that I unfortunately have another rather embarrassing problem, I had a urethral stricutre which was removed. Unfortunately the scar tissue created by this means that when I pass water it tends not to come out in a nice flow but can spray around a bit. Unfortunately this can't really be fixed as it could create further scarring. I quite often find that when using a urinal, what's coming out of me will splash off the urinal and back onto my trousers. I worry that it will also splash anything already in the urinal onto me, for example and small amounts of semen or blood. Believe it or not, where I work there does seem to sometimes be semen in the urinal. I never really see it when I'm out and about, but just in work. When I get home I feel like my trousers are contaminated and I change them and have a shower. I have asked various close friends about this and they say they would do the same! The problem is I worry one step further. I worry that because I drove home with the trousers on, then anything that splashed on them will now be on the car seat. As Hepatitis can last so long I worry I am recontaminating myself when I next use the car. Now, I'm sure that you would be unlikely to infect yourself like this, most people don't feel the need to clean the inside of the car of course. But, as I seem to be more prone to infection, is it ok for me to leave it to?
At the end of the day I suppose it comes down to taking a chance. If I was taking the same chance as everyone else I would forget about it all. But, if I really am more at risk, is it still ok to forget about it or do I really need to be more careful than most people? Psychologists would probably say I should do CBT, but the GP would say I do need to be careful.
Thanks for reading through all that. I'm at the end of my tether really, it seems every time I think of a psychological solution, like CBT, there is a physical problem that prevents me from doing it. Maybe it really is not possible for me to be as carefree as everyone else should be in terms of contamination. I hope not!
I hope this has not triggered anyone's OCD. I would hate that more than anything. Please remember that I have these sores, and that I could well be wrong about them allowing Hepatitis in. Most people don't have them and do not need to worry about catching things like that.","['drop', 'washing hands', 'hope', 'eczema', 'hepatitis', 'OCD', 'symptom']",[],"['hope', 'washing hands', 'OCD', 'drop', 'hepatitis', 'symptom', 'eczema']",,1.0,,,
"Hello all!
This is my first post on the forum.. thanks in advance to anyone who can offer any advice or help.
I'm not 100% sure how to describe exactly what I'm experiencing at the moment. Not really sure if it's OCD or anxiety, or a mixture of the 2 (or something else, even).
Guess I should probably start with my somewhat of a backstory so you get the gist of what I'm trying to describe.
From the start... as a kid I had a nervous/excessive blinking problem. I do have issues with my eyes, so that may have contributed to that, although my eye condition only really came on in later life, so perhaps not. Luckily I got past that as I got in to my teens (I'm now 27), so that's not affected me for years. Nothing else really to mention from my childhood - I was a relatively 'normal' kid, for want of a better word.
In more recent years, I have been struggling with tremors. To the point where exercises which were once very simple and basic, such as writing for example, have become a challenge. Which isn't ideal, as I work in an office. It's also quite embarrassing. I try to make light of it when someone mentions it (""""""""bloody hell, Lew, you're a bit shaky) and just try to move on to something else ASAP. Even stupid trivial things like playing pool, or carry drinks from a bar, tends to draw a comment about how shaky I look.. quite annoying, really, but not the end of the world.
I used to play guitar in bands too, and the shakes were always a pain in the **** in the studio or at gigs.. did used to detract from my performance at times. Though I don't do much of that any more, so it's not too relevant.
I've also started to notice that I can have these weird mood swings. I can literally go from being happy and joking, to being annoyed/angry/easily agitated in mere seconds. Then I can sometimes swing back the other way, or stay annoyed for the rest of the day, over pretty much nothing. Nothing even has to trigger it, it's just like a switch in my head.
I like to think of myself as a fairly easy going person too, so it can be quite out-of-character for me to suddenly sink in to some weird mood when I was completely fine a minute ago.
Some days I just want to completely shut myself away too, not speak to anybody or be around people at all, which again, I never used to experience. It's quite detrimental to potential relationships, 'cos I get to the point where I just don't want to speak to anyone, then I appear ignorant and, at times, completely disinterested, which isn't the case. But it's hard to explain. I know I want to get know people and speak to them, but there's something about the way I currently am which just puts a barrier up.. like I'm happy shut off in my own little world, which I'm not, 'cos it can be lonely as (insert naughty word) and I'd much rather have someone around.
I did visit my GP about the tremors. They basically just said my heart rate was a tad quicker than most people's and prescribed me some beta blockers to slow the pace down slightly. These never really worked and made me feel a bit crappy when I took them, so I knocked them on the head.
In more recent weeks, I've been having this weird issue with my breathing. It's like, at times, it goes from being what should be a sub-conscious thing, to something that's on my mind, and it becomes a manual thing, where I'm sort of trying to take over how I breathe because I don't trust that I'm getting enough oxygen. In more extreme cases, it's literally felt like I'm struggling to breathe, then I start panicking, which increases the heart rate, thus increasing the tremors etc.. bit of a nasty cycle. I've got more of a grasp on it recently, but at night is the worst time. Because there's literally nothing else going on, it's always on my mind, so it's hard to nod off and it's really affecting my sleep, which then affects my mood the next day. I've tried putting a bit of music on or a podcast whilst in bed to try and take my mind off it, but then I find myself listening too much to whatever's playing, which again affects my ability to get to sleep.
The only thing that seems to magically cure all is alcohol (not a great solution, I know). If I'm a bit tuned in, the shakes go, the mood swings go, there's no thinking about my breathing, I can sleep normal, everything's 'fine'... but then if I drink, I feel it the next day, and everything I have mentioned above is even more exaggerated than usual the day after, so it's a catch-22 really.
Basically, I don't even know what I'm describing. Just wondering if anyone can relate to what I'm saying? Anybody else have similar problems? Should I be looking in to CBT, or is there any other methods that anyone could recommend to try and counter what I'm describing?
I'm writing all this fairly quickly in work, so I may have missed something out too. If I have, I'll add another post underneath.
Just wanted to get this off my chest and speak to people who might be able to offer some good advice. Sorry if I've bored the life out of you with my mammoth post!

"I've been here before and I know i'll be here again, Christmas is just a few days away and i'm feeling rubbish. I always seem to be able to have a really bad OCD/anxiety episode just before any time of year or event that i'm really looking forward to.
I haven't posted for ages because in general things have been really good on the OCD front but this week has been a nightmare.
My main OCD worry has been centred around HIV for about 20 years now.
This current situation started on Monday when my boss asked me to help carry his bags from the office to his car. I was putting his laptop bag in the boot when I felt something sharp against my index finger. I didn't say anything at the time but checked my finger for marks etc when I got back in the office but couldn't see anything obvious. That evening I was a little anxious about what had happened but not too bad.
However, the next morning when I was driving to work though I noticed a red dot on my finger in the exact place where I had felt the sharp object, needless to say I had an instant anxiety attack/hot flush. When I got to work, although I know I shouldn't have, I rang my boss who is very understanding about my ocd and asked him if there was anything sharp sticking out of his laptop bag. He confirmed that there was a little bit of the zip sticking out and that it was a little spikey. This seemed to help the anxiety as it temporarily put to rest all the other scary thoughts I was having about hyperdermic needles etc being in his laptop bag.
When my boss came into work on Wednesday I asked him to show me the area on his laptop bag where the spikey zip was, he tried to show me but the zip had sorted itself back out and was no longer sticking out. Unfortunately this just fuelled my ocd/anxiety and my thoughts then started to go down the pattern that he had made up the zip story to stop me worrying. So, I asked him and he said it was really annoying that the zip wasn't like it anymore because it definately was the day before and he wouldn't mess with my head like that because he knows what it would do to me.
Anyway, to cut a very long story a bit shorter, I have asked him several more times about the incident culminating in me getting him to swear on my life that there were no needles etc in his bag which he reluctantly did but I could tell he wasn't very happy with doing it. He said that he wouldn't normally ever swear on anyone's life as he doesn't think it's right but on this occassion he would if it would help me in anyway. After he had done this I very embarrisingly burst into tears at my desk as I was feeling so down about the whole thing.
I now feel just as bad as before about the zip situation and to make thing worse I feel totally humiliated as far as my boss is concerned.
I know my story proves that getting reassurance is a bad thing to do but the urge was so strong that I just felt I wasn't able to resist.
I hope I can somehow get over this by Christmas day as I have a lovely wife and 2 cracking kids, maybe one of you guys could point me towards the light.
Thanks for listening to me.

"OCD runs through my father's line in my family. He and his sister, my sister and I. pretty conclusive evidence of a genetic link!
In my case as a child - brought up in The Midlands - I would seek not to step on cracks in pavement, carry our counting rituals and I was a bit of a checker and worrier, but nothing there that caused any due concern or behavioural issues.
After a wonderful 2 years at college in Southampton, and a fantastically character-forming 3 months working in Germany (I've always been interested in languages and have studied French, German at school and college, Latin and Russian at school - and Spanish and Italian as a hobby) I settled in London and took up a career in the City of London.
Fascinated with people and psychology, it was clear that an outside role would be ideal for me, and I have carried such out for over 40 years.- this has included the wonderful experience of insurance broking in 2 Lloyd's of London buildings, and acting for professional firms, large medium and global.
In the 1970's OCD traits appeared a little more. I recall one evening when I prepared to go out to a disco, and I sprayed my hair with hairspray - then had a repetitive intrusive thought that I had in fact sprayed my hair with;paint!!!
Other variations on this theme came later when I was working with fibreglass repairing my car, and got distressed thinking - """"""""what if my clothes were made of fibreglass?"""""""".
I began to experience periods of thoughts looping - words or images would stick in my mind and not go away - and these """"""""episodes"""""""" would last for some hours, or even some days. usually this occurred when I wasn't working, typically when taking leave - which was really sad and distressing.
I began to notice tendencies towards unpleasant, distressing loops of words - such as titles of books, headlines. I recall one time when I was touring Scotland by car, and before I drove back to London I caught sight of a book in a store which my mind labelled """"""""unpleasant"""""""" and I couldn't get the title of that book out of my head all the drive back down to London.
My wife and I met when we were 30-odd. I explained that I had some problems with looping thoughts to her, and we realised that these tended towards unpleasant distressing or violent, but we decided that keeping busy - distraction was a good way to combat this (IT IS OF COURSE) and I wasn't on alert for getting mental health treatment because, although I was and still am close to my sister, she didn't tell me the exact nature of her concerns for quite some time.
When she did, and it became apparent her problems were of an OCD nature, we knew or at least suspected a parallel with mine, though her type of OCD is different.
When the episodes of intense looping thoughts worsened in length when I was around 50 we decided I would seek help, and my doctor and the firm's BUPA medical insurance referred me for CBT to a psychiatrist. Whilst being taught how CBT worked was great - and I am still a total believer in it - his solution of flooding myself for 2 weeks with intense exposure to violent themes was totally wrong, confirmed later by another psychiatrist and CBT therapis;, I know myself it was wrong and, to his amazement, terminated the therapy!!! I'm a very very strong character, afraid of no-one, and used to dealing one-to-one with very powerful people and personalities, and standing up to him was easy for me, but a lot of others I am sure would have buckled and done what he said.
When I did get to a brilliant psychiatrist, and wonderful therapist, I was properly diagnosed and we drew up a map of my OCD and a blueprint of what helps recovery.
Whilst these are great, and if I did not have the episodic thought loops I think would be incredibly successful, it is those thought loops - and the episodes of OCD - that remain my continuing problem.
I have been in a very bad episode recently, that started in August and only stopped during OCD Awareness week - I put the reason for the shutting down of the episode down to the intense activity I threw into OCD Awareness Week - so thank you OCD-UK - I also gained a massive benefit, not just those who benefited from the spread of awareness.

"Hello All,
I hope that this is the correct place to introduce yourself, I'm not sure TBH. Anyways, Hello to everybody, a few of you I know, many of you, I look forward to getting to know! As my name suggests, I have used this Forum twice before, although, not always with the best decorum or in the best state of mind. I hope to correct this, however, I can't promise that a frantic word will never pass my lips, I have begun my journey to 'eventually' joining a Therapeutic Community and I thought that it would be sensible to catch up with a few old friends and make a few new ones, and, also, so I can seek advice and Hopefully offer my own, if needed! Anyone with any Positive experiences of Long Stays in a Therapeutic Community, please, share your success stories if you would care too, that would be very kind indeed!
Most importantly, however, I have stopped drinking, after a long time (heavy drinking, heavy-heavy drinking)! I managed to wangle myself a detox at the Beginning of September and Have now been sober for Two months, again, any advice on this, please, ask away (although, best leave any medical questions to the 'Professionals' and remember that my experiences are subjective but I hope, will prove useful to anyone who's currently struggling along). And, for anyone that is, all my Heart goes out to you, it's ****, I know!
That said then, I guess I'm back on here because I Need to kick-start my social interaction, make new friends and say a long overdue Hello to any of those still Here. To see how the forum and the Website has grown and changed and whether or not to Brave an AGM, this or next Year, or a Chrimbo Party!
I will update, or rather, fill in my profile anew. However, I'll just give some quick details, I am very nearly Thirty, I have just started to use the Gym again and I am re-joining MIND. It has to be done, but my annoyingly persistent personality pleb, would rather I chained myself to my sofa and watched Sky! I'm Re-discovering the world, I could really do with the support of each and everyone on here, because, I admit, it's tough and in return, you shall, have mine and Gawd, I need a place to vent, LOL! Not all the time, but, we all do occasionally, yeah? I hope so! It's good to vent!
And, I should add, for the Benefit of All, that I suffer mainly from Magical Thinking, Pure O and Ruminations, in terms of OCD and that I have a Harmless but rather Grim Personality Disorder (An Emotionally Unstable or Borderline Personality Disorder, I'm labeled by 'The Man')! He-He!!!
Thank You All and Please, Get In Touch,

"hey all!
i am 22 f from england and have suffered from ocd prob all my life, always as a child i was quite obsessive.
i got real bad in my teens it prob started when i started high school but it real got bad whn i was 15, (a teacher was trying to """"""""coax"""""""" me as my docter thinks, he was a perv and it made me feel so ill just him sitting near me freaked me out. he never tried anything he just made me feel dirty staring at me and all the girls ugh!!!!) i blame usa TV for how i delt with and started my ocd. if ever a woman has a bad day she always had a cold shower to """"""""wash it all away"""""""" so i thought, Yeah now thats a way to make me feel clean! (the thing is i hates cold showers so i thought, Ah hot ones will do, the dirt will still go down the drain and thats where i wanted it to go! :original:
so from the age of 15 i showered up to 6 times a day if ever i had a bad thought or just saw something what reminded me of him or school, i would scrub wash anything to get it out of my head. i would be in the shower for 45 mins just counting thinking of visual patterns and counting them. if i got a thought in between i would have to stop and start again !!!!
i also couldn't walk or move if i had a bad thought or saw something untill i did all my counting. (i couldn't even stand on a bit in my hall cos i had to many bad moments there, so i would have to jump it.)
My best mate was the first to notice it, we were watching a film at the movies and noticed i was mumbeling to myself she was like """"""""what the hell are you doing!"""""""" i found out later she had a bit of ocd with over washing her hands.
there was only one moment in my teens i can really remeber and enjoy and that was following a boyband called 911 around the country and they made me feel good, loved and liked.
it wasn't until i left school i told my parents, i was real good at hiding it - (well i felt a bit of a freak to tell you the truth i was young i couldn't control my thoughts)
It was only when i was reading a mag showing about young people with ocd i realised that was what i had!
My mum and dad were so upset that they didnt realise this was going on, i dont blame them for not noticing i didn't want them to i hated myself because of it.
the worse bit was that i couldn't go out with my friends to clubs because i would panic about it then need a shower. one night i had a fit and was screaming and crying cos i felt fat and my head was going mad with bad thoughts i was trying to shave my legs in the bath and i kept crying my dad was real worried, that was when my mum had to tell him about my illness, he was so heartbroken that i couldn't tell him but i felt a freak and didn't think he would understand, unlike my mum who suffers with similar things.
i went to the doctor and started on prozac i felt a hell of alot better. (at first i didn't want to take them i felt to young to take tablets, but i thank god for them now ) i started therepy and at 20 i started to feel a hell of a lot better.
i now can go out and hold my head high, i dont shower like i did my hair doesn't fall out anymore thnak god, but i do have real bad dry skin now. i do have times when i feel a bit obsessive but i just stop and have a look around and know im a ok!

"Hey everyone,
I was looking through the internet about OCD and I came across this forum.
I also suffer from OCD and I feel it is getting worse.
It really started to really come to the surface when I was having family problems a couple of years ago and as I have said it getting worse.
I constantly have bad thoughts about things happening to the people I care about and I worry that because I have thought these things they are going to happen and its going to be all my fault. I get so worked up over these thoughts I start crying and sometimes hyperventilating.
I have plently of rituals I MUST complete before I leave the house, check all the plugs are turned off and out of the sockets and all the taps must be turned off. Sometimes it can take me up to half an hour to leave the house and I have to keep repeating these checks until I'm kind of satisfied even though I never completly am. These checks also have to be completed in even numbers as if I check an odd number of times I'm scared something bad is going to happen.
I sometimes feel, I trapped in my own body, if you understand what I mean.
I am hoping by joining this forum that I can talk to people who understand what I'm going through and get, as well, as give support.

Ended up leaving university after missing so much time due to my rituals getting longer and longer and the thoughts in my head worse and worse, which is when i decided enough was enough and broke down to my poor GP! (the only GP out of 5 that took my depression seriously!)

"Hey guys/girls
I'm Max, I'm a 15 year old teen from Derbyshire.
I've got OCD obviously ^_^ I've got a therapist who I go to see on a weekly basis.
Personally I've never met anyone who has had OCD accept from my dad, it's great that my dad has had it because he can give me methods to help.
I think I'm a nice guy, I LOVE gaming and facebook.
I've had OCD for around 8 years and it has been pretty bad and has affected my home/school/social life, it hasn't been all the time bad for the full 9 years, but from 9 years ago it was gradually getting worse to say the least, I think I really started to notice what I was doing at about 12-13.
Has anyone else in the area been diagnosed in the area around my age? I'd love a friend who I could speak to in confidence, even though I've got my dad and therapist, it would be great, you can maybe just message me or something, I don't mind =)
I'll tell you some of my rituals what I have to do..
I have to wash my hands ALOT, Once I've washed my hands, if I touch a railing, door handle, trousers, T shirt, I have to wash my hands again.
I normally wash them about 15-20 times per day which is really bad for my hands..
I go through lists of things what could happen to my family or people who I care for, and think of ways to prevent it happening, and then do them.
I have to run my hands around the door frames in any room of my house before I enter/leave.
That is a minimal chunk of my rituals..
So yeah, if you want to ask me anything, feel free =) ]
Cya later guys!

"Hi all,
This is a new thing for me. Just wanted to start out by saying 'Hi' and it is nice to know that there are people who understand what you are going through. I noticed my symptoms of OCD when I was 9 years old. I was diagnosed with OCD and PTSD when I was 17 years old, had therapy at 19 and was in denial I had the condition for a further 11 years making it 21 in total.I am now 30 years old. I have recently 'Come out' again and although I live with the OCD and I am much kinder on myself these days, I tend to just kind of move with the flow. I am not really used to talking about my OCD and giving much attention to the OCD thoughts because rationally I know it isn't real but it is trusting knowing it isn't real. . I don't know if I am making much sense. In the 'real' world, my friends and family know I have the condition but due to the nature of it (Magical thinking) I do not talk about it because I have found the more I do that the symptoms are more severe and it just kinda ropes people in. It would actually break my heart to let people see the rituals that I perform, it mostly consists of repetitive behaviour.
I just thought I would poke my nose in and say 'Hey'

"Hey
Im 16 and a sufferer from OCD,
When i was 14 my mum took me to the doctor as i was doing weird things like washing my hands after i touched anything Door handles, food, plates. Just anything and then i started checking everything making sure the gas was off and all the windows and doors were locked. I used to be just going to sleep then it was like this big urge of fear that i needed to check and before i knew what i was doing i was out of my bed and checking doors and windows, i used to get this feeling to tap things a certain number of times or someting bad would happen to me or a loved one. The doctor said it sounded alot like OCD. He said because of my age that it might have just been a phase and told me if it got worse to come back. It settled for a about a year and then it just came back 10 times worse but this time i was Checking, Cleaning hands every 5 minutes, and then i became afraid of the number 3 and 13 i cant do anything that consits of them numbers. I am now constantly tapping my head in a pattern most of the day because if i dont something bad will happen to someone that i love or something, just anything. I cant go to the doctor or speak to my parents about it because now im older and think that feeling like this is embarrasing when i know its not but i just think theyre gonna judge me and when i go speak about it something in my head stops me and tells me not to. i have went to go call the doctor a few times, picked up the phone and theres something just telling me do that and this will get worse, we will hurt a love one and ruin your life? So i dont because i feel resposable and a part of me thinks whats in my head will happen but i know some where that it wont but it always takes over and i cant cope anymore its getting to the point where im not wanting to socialise with friends, not wanting to leave the house because when im on busses im bringing out hand gel every two minutes and tapping my head in a pattern cause if i dont i think the bus will crash. i also think this started when i was younger because i remember when i was 13 i was afraid to be that age i said it was unlucky and i counted down the days till i was 14. i also used to make my parents check doors and cookers were off because i was that worried about it. i never used to have a care in the world or be scared or worry but now thats what i am doing 24/7. If i think ive heard a noise i cant feel safe until ive checked about four times that it was nothing. Its getting to the point that because im keeping it to myself is making it worse but i feel embarrased and even writing this was so hard, but i know nobody with ocd and i dont know if what im feeling is normal and im just scared that one day its tells me to do something i shouldnt like hurt someone or hurt myself because i got the point that i cant live with this anymore. Everyday its getting worse and its making me ill . Ive left school now but i had a bad time there because i couldnt concentrate in my exams and i was always late or absent from school because this just took over my life and i couldnt face even more stress of being in school. I just need advice i guess and to speak to more people that are in the same position as me i guess.

"I was diagnosed with OCD in 2009 but I've suffered with it since I was a teen. I have fears that I will be responsible for the deaths of loved ones if I do not complete certain rituals. It is fairly pervasive in my life, but my rituals are mostly mental, and I have a ton of neutralization statements I use a workarounds, so I mostly get my life and work done, but it slows me down incredibly. I am looking for help coping with this, since it makes me physically sick worrying constantly whether I am going to """"""""step on a mine"""""""" and something bad will happen or when I do miss a ritual it results in weeks of rumination and being sick with worry (I have IBS so the anxiety generated by the worry debilitates me physically).
I've read the forums on and off since before my diagnosis and I've found the discussions helpful, so I decided to join. It doesn't feel too odd being in a UK forum, since my grandfather was born in London and came to the US in the early 20th century as a kid. I heard stories about his life in England here and there while growing up.

"Hello, I've not posted here before but I have been reading other people's posts and getting help from them. 
I was recently discharged form NHS CBT treatment and I'm feeling quite lost.  The health centre I attended does not believe in giving mental health patients specific diagnosis's except in obvious cases, but I was treated for OCD symptoms and did ERP therapy.  I made a list for graded exposure and did some ERP with the therapist but I was unfortunately discharged before I got to the top of the list, so I'm now trying to do the things that make the most anxious on my own - but I'm not coping well and have ended up at the bottom of the list again.   I've also gone back to not trusting my own judgement, so I'm too scared to do the ERP in case I'm mistaken, and feeling like I'm using OCD diagnosis as an excuse for being a bad person.  
But the main thing I wanted to ask is how can you do ERP if your OCD theme keeps changing?  For example I am now for the first time in my life started to get obsessed with contamination, but I am doing ERP for making mistakes at work.  But now all I think about is contamination so I'm struggling to function well (sleep, eat properly etc.).  I feel like getting a handle on OCD is impossible - just when I'm making progress it morphs into something else and slips out of reach, and I'm back where I started. Also does anyone think it would also be worthwhile trying to get more help through a private therapist? Thank you.

"Hi,
I'm new here (obviously!) and just wanted to say hello and introduce myself.
I've suffered with what I believe to be OCD for a number of years (started when I was younger with blinking rituals after I had """"""""bad"""""""" thoughts, doing everything in groups of 4, having to walk left or right around certain objects - I've kind've """"""""grown out"""""""" of those type opf rituals now though) and my latest issue is with compulsive internet checking. I regularly check my FB or Twitter up to 100 times a day (I've been tracking the time in a log book) and in particular certain people's pages... I realised it was becoming a big problem when I was trying to access these pages on holiday, whereby in the past I would never have used my phone abroad for the internet.
So I'm trying to go cold turkey on certain pages, setting time limits daily and basically trying to turn my life around. I have a supportive husband and family, and am currently 2 days into my new routine (that doesn't sound like a lot I know, but it is for me).
Hope to speak to some of you soon,

"Hi
I'm Greg from Cornwall. I've come here because I need urgent help.
OCD is my life. I have ritualistic thoughts almost every second of my life. My life doesn't function properly and at the moment all I can think of is suicide. Yes, it's that bad. I feel anxious all the time and can't live my life the way I want. I've had OCD since primary school. I was never a 'normal' kid; I didn't like sports or playing 'army' and because of that I got beat down everyday. OCD was my coping mechanism, which looking back now is kinda funny. Whenever someone hit me or called me a name I would touch a surface twice. This ritual seemed to make everything ok. I then went to secondary school and was bullied some more. I clinged to OCD; it was my religion. As the bullying gradually got worse my rituals got way more complex. I remember a biology class, which was already bad because I used to faint at all that menstraul cycle stuff :lol2: my teacher (Mr ******) caught me touching my desk like 20 times (It had to be an even number!) and alerted the class to it. Whenever I had a class with that teacher he would say something like """"""""Ok class before I begin I'm gonna do a Greg and touch the black board 20 times"""""""" Perhaps unsurprisingly this made my OCD's much worse. Anyway, fast-forward through my a-level days to my time at University. I went to a local Arts University to study English. Here I was a loner mainly because I'm straightedge. Nobody would talk to me or sit next to me; I felt really alone. Anyway, blah, blah, blah enough emo boy! I started to cut and burn myself at University too... Just so I could feel something and not being dead to the world. I quit University a year later and my parents were very disappointed. I felt useless and spent all day everyday walking round in circles, counting to 100 and cutting myself... Anyway, it's getting late I'll cut to the chase...
Ummm how do I let go of OCD? It seems impossible right now.

"Hi,

I am a newbie (please be kind to me!!), and I think that I have OCD. I had a panic attack out of the blue before Christmas, and since then I have started to really obsess about things to the point where I am having anxiety most of the day. I am worried about contamination by blood/bodily fluids.

It started really suddenly when I thought I found a chip in my food with blood on (it was potato pigment), and then from there, I started worrying about finding blood or needles everywhere. I am washing my hands so much that they are chapped and have cuts (which I then worry will be infected by the blood of another person). I have started to wear gloves to wash up, and even to handle things I feel uneasy about (like shopping from supermarket, etc). I am constantly fearful of finding blood in food, and seem to have funny tastes in my mouth, which then prompts me to throw the food away. I have lost 2 stone since Christmas because of this.

Today, I freaked out after a heating engineer used my toilet. I worried he may have """"""""contaminated"""""""" the loo, and so I cleaned it (wearing 2 pairs of gloves at once) about 5/6 times before I felt calmer. I had a shower. I bought a new loo seat (and cleaned that 3 times), and made everyone use the other toilet in the house. This is not normal and it is freaking me out how much control this OCD behaviour has on me.

I last saw the GP after Xmas and he referred me to counselling but I am still waiting. The more I wait, the more out of control I feel. I am going tomorrow to see GP and hope to talk things through. I don't want medication though.

Does anyone suffer from similar issues? How do you cope?

Skipped way ahead to now, I had been quite ill for some time. It turned out I have a vitamine B12 deficiency, lactose intolerance and a bad case of the stomach acid (I take meds for the B12 and acid and avoid all lacose products).
Since I got a little better from all the above, I have been terrified of getting sick (on top of the couting and checking everything)
Quick run through my day:
wake up at 6.53 o'clock.
every step from then till 8.15 is the same, every day at exactly the same time.
I'm a smoker and I make my own cigs, if on a working day I make them the night before and must leave with exaclty 20 cigs,
Leaving at 8.15 check cigs, check lights, check pets and their water+food serveral times.
Out in the alley before closing door, must have keys in hands before closing the door, then check cigs, phone and what the time is.
It takes 7 mins to get to work. So at 8.22 I walk in to the building.. eventhough I don't start till 9 am.. I don't do late. I have never been late and I don't intend to be.
I also clean my desk at work every morning with my own wipes, do not touch door handles or buttons.
Then skipping to foods and contamination:
I don't eat from the canteen at work, I always bring my own food. I don't know how food in the canteen is stored, cooked and how long it's been out. (freaks me out)
I don't go to work parties, I don't do BBQ's at work or at friends houses. (same reason as above + I have difficulty being """"""""social"""""""")
Preparing food at home is hell sometimes, raw chicken is real hell for me.. washing hands all the time, disinfecting everything before and after etc.
Food (like rice and chicken in sauce) cannot touch.
Now it has come to, if I think someone hasn't washed their hands before touching the food, I will not eat it and throw it out..
With thinking something """"""""strange"""""""" is in my food or drink, I won't eat it because I'm scared of getting sick...
I had therapy last year, not for OCD only, but this was during the time when my vitamine b12 deficiency was still undiagnosed.
Before I got officialy diagnosed having OCD, I quit therapy.
The fear of getting ill by 'bad food' is getting worse. I though my other half touched an unwashed chopping board the other day and then touched the clean washing up from the dishwasher.. I had to run all of it, including the content of the cupboard through the dishwasher again.
If anybody interrupts my morning ritual, i'm offset all day..
I think that's quite enough of a story for now... !
I'm wondering what you all think?

"Hey guys, thought i'd sign up here. My name's jen, I'm 23 and Ive had OCD for a good few years now. Some of my spikes -
-Illness, I was convinced I had HIV for years, finally got the test and it was negative, but the person who gave me the test told me she had it after I got my results so for a few months it still lingered that the test was wrong or she had told me the wrong results, or even I got it from her. The illness list has also included brain tumors for a long time as I get headaches on very bad days of ruminating
-Probably the worst Ive had is that I am unsure if I was abused by a family member when I was young and couldnt quite remember, but this had lead to extreme anxiousness that I am a peadophile or people think I am.
-Holding a conversation when I think someone can read my thoughts/body language is also very annoying.
-Hand washing and Im extremeley funny with anybody touching my food or sharing things
-Extreme violent thoughts - although this helps me do the kind of art I like
-Obsessively fantasising, I can spend hours in my head acting out scenes and trying to get certain euphoric feelings by make believing. This is actually getting worse and Im worried it is going somewhere where it could do something damaging to my personality - anyone else get this??? I also get very stressed out if I get interupted and have to repeat the scene. I'm told this could be a dissociative disorder.
-Repeating a convo or a sentence in my head until it feels right.
-I call it inner tourettes, sometimes I will be talking to someone and verbally abusing them in my head or laughing at something sensitive theyre telling me, its happened a few times where I have the urge to/think I have already come out with it.
-Walking down a street I make myself a goal, if i get to here (a lampost for example) in X seconds ''everything will be okay''.
-I also research pretty much everything on the internet when I first got diagnosed, I obsessed over OCD
So yeah.. there's many more but those are the most prominent or have effected me the most.

"hi all
havent posted fora while
went to see my gp about a year or so ago about my anxiety symptoms which match some of the symptoms for ocd, i think they're essentially a manifestation of my inner anxiety which i've had for years on and off and which manifests itself from time to time, depending on whats going on in my life;
years ago, i seem to remember things from about aged 10 upwards; it was rituals ie saying and doing things the 'right way' and much later on in my teens and twenties, going back and checking things, touching things compulsively, fear of someth ing going wrong if i didnt
inothing was ever done, never saw anyone and when i spoke to my mum about it, it was pretty much brushed under the carpet,
then i never spoke of it again, dont know why originally but i think later on i was too embarrassed to seek help, people might think the wrong thing etc, something like that,
just under a couple of years ago, i had a panicky moment at work and found i was checking things over and over, phoning my colleagues up after work to make sure nothing bad had happened, seeking reassurance
needless to say my self confidence has taken a right bashing!
its come back now, i was on cipramil the last time, the only time ive ever been given meds for it; got referred to a counsellor, my dad died 5 years ago this year, and i probably thought that delayed grief might have something to do with it, well you think of everything dont you?
it does raise its head hwen i'm stressed or worried, very much so
i'm not on any meds now, havent been back to my gp since jan 2008, thought i could cope as it were, more people worse off etc etc but its as bad as ever and i am worrying all the time
we've had a lot of stress at work lately, interpersonal conflicts etc which have stressed me out and made me very anxious
im checking things, and i have a thing about a light switch in our granny flat airing cupboard and while i KNOW its switched off i keep going back to check that i havent turned it on, why id think that i dont know but thats the ocd i suppose!
i have this feeling of hyper responsibility; i have a very responsible job and i worry that in my anxiety i might make a mistake, i know thats highly unlikely but i still worry; i worry that i havent expressed myself correctly so i repeat myself a lot and worry so much about how others might interpret/misinterpret what i have said
my concentration and memory are rubbish; i forget sillly things and while i pride myself on being good at my job, i've let people and situations get to me more than they should
sh ould i go back to my gp? do i need my meds? i asked my gp about CBT [apparently its supposed to be the thing for OCD and anxiety in general] but he said he hadn't got a clue and he could only refer me to a nurse therapist like before; would that work do you think?
not sure what to do

At last i went to see my GP about OCD. He has put me on medication to help with Anxiety and depression, but also recomended me to this website. I have found lots of usefull information and will be trying my best to work with the four steps.
My main hang up are the rituals i need to go through before leaving the house (it can take me forever).
Anyone else do this?

"Hi there
Three people in my family have OCD, and I think I have it too. I am freaking out right now because I was washing my hands this morning in the bathroom at work, and my sleeve touched the edge of the sink as I had my hands under the tap (the side of the sink closer to me). I think my sleeve might've actually touched the inside of the sink (the very top part of the sink). I couldn't wash my sleeve, so I went outside in the sun for about 2 minutes. I heard that sunlight kills germs - that's why I did that. I went back to the sink to inspect it as I didn't inspect it properly when the incident happened. I saw some sort of dried liquid on the edge of the sink (the part that I think my sleeve touched). Perhaps it was liquid soap or makeup. I'm worried in case I picked up bad bacteria or a virus. My work colleagues aren't the cleanest. I see ladies not washing their hands properly or not washing them straight after using the toilet - they do their hair or touch things in the bathroom cupboard before washing their hands. Someone left menstrual blood in the toilet last month. The month before there was urine on the toilet seat. Please help. I'm worried I've contaminated everything.

Hope your all well. Now I know I'm meant to be off for lent but I REALLY need some support. I have been so anxious today I was sure I was going to throw up in the middle of the street
Ok...so I seen my therapist today for the 3rd time and she is lovely. She seems very approachable and very supportive and is giving little pieces of homework. She spoke to a colleague last week about me because her colleague is traind in ocd cby. Today I told her my exact fear/thought/false memory because I wanted her to understand why I've been so distressed. She was very calm and said she has every faith this is not something I would do etc and to be so distressed shows im a caring person etc and so on. However I told her that I fear I was spiked and it made me act out of control. I am extremely worried and riddled with anxiety that she will tell her colleagues and I will get a knock on the door and children took away.
Please tell me if this is a normal reaction to therapy and also by telling her my thought it seems so so real again I just want to cry. Please please someone make me see sense I'm not in a good way...please.... x","['hope', 'OCD', 'anxiety', 'anxiety', 'fear', 'Thought']",['spike'],"['anxiety', 'OCD', 'fear', 'Thought', 'spike', 'hope']",1.0,,,,
"I signed up to make connections with fellow sufferers of OCD because I feel alone in this. The only one who really knows about my condition (extensively) is my ex boyfriend, but we are no longer speaking. I've been actively seeking help from a psychiatrist, counsellor, and currently taking a low dose of Zoloft every morning. I was involved in a CBT group last year.
My OCD came about the age of 21 when I would obsessively check to see if my doors and windows were locked to my dorm room. I have also been a reassurance seeker, asking the same questions over and over again until I feel """"""""just right"""""""". Over the years, my OCD has worsened in washing- doing my laundry, showering more than once a day, washing my hands, sanitizing my kitchen floors, avoiding certain items, all because I am afraid of being contaminated with fecal matter or germs. I have a cat, too, which doesn't help because she has defecated on the carpet more than once or sometimes she has her own feces stuck to her fur. It causes me so much anxiety sometimes that I have cried. I work as an elementary teacher, which is difficult for my OCD because the kids are always touching something I consider dirty, like the bottom of their shoes after coming outside or the floors.
I know my shame of OCD has impacted my life. The guy I dated last suspected I had contamination fears, which led me to believe that was one of the reasons why he broke up with me. I try really hard to hide it from my family and friends because I feel that they would never understand why I have it or empathize.
I hope to be able to provide a caring """"""""ear"""""""" and gain support from this forum.

"Hi everyone, I'm 23 and I have had ocd since I was about 10 but in the last 2 or 3 years it has become unbearable. When it started it wasn't that bad but I started worrying about germs and washing my hands a lot, which got really bad about 4 or 5 years ago. My hands were really sore all the time and had cuts on them. I also used to worry a lot about getting deaseses like cancer and aids and things like that. So I took ages in the shower rinsing myself over and over 2 make sure the soap was off and I had 2 take ages drying myself as well 2 make sure there was no water left on me.
Then about 3 years ago I stopped worrying about germs and deaseses so much and started worrying about new things like if I hear something or c something or get a negative thought in my head I have 2 repeat the action that I'm doing at the time over and over until I feel better which can take 10-15 mins at a time. These sort of worries and complosion loops r happening 2 me constantly. It's hard 2 explain but if 4 example I am scratching my head and I hear someone talking or shouting I have 2 keep scratching my head in the same place and reasuring myself that it is alright and that nothing Is going 2 happen. I think if I don't do this that I will become a different person.
Please can u all offer your support on this because I am really struggling atm and would very much appreciate it.

"Hi everyone,
Logged on as I just had an argument with my mum again. We argue all the time these days. We are really close and she is sympathetic towards my ocd but the problems started a couple of years ago when she insisted on knowing what was going on, why I was doing it (in terms of my ocd in general) and that she wanted to help me with some of my chores. All of which I told her I coudnt talk about but she just went on and on and I knew it wouldnt be a good idea as now she regularly helps out with some of my rituals which isnt good I know as it then involves her too but as I mentioned before, she is the one who wanted to help and I didn't want her to. Anyway, we had an a bust up tonight as I havent slept for two days now and just before she was going to bed I asked if she wouldnt mind passing me some wipes which i needed to clean something, anyhow, because she we just about to get into bed she went nuts, which is understandable and I am completely grateful that she helps me in the first place although I initially didnt want her help, but I could do without her throwing a hissy fit and making things ten times worse. For example. I needed a wipe to clean something, so what does my mum do to express her anger, she throws her clothes on the stairs which in my mind is utterly disgusting and she knows this, meaning that now I will no longer be able to take food or drink from her or anything else she offers to hand me. I am now freaking out. To her its just an outburst but she has no idea what shes done. My mind is going nuts. basically having a panic attack over it. I dont know what to do. It may sound silly to you but I have contamination ocd and so this is a big deal to me :o( But anyway, the reason I brought this up is because like I said we argue a lot and just the other day she said to my face that she wishes something bad would happen to me!! I couldnt believe she said that. I mean, if I didnt have ocd that would be obviously offensive but as I'm sure many of you know living with ocd is mostly living with the feeling that something bad will happen, so I was particularly upset. This is what I mean when I say that she is trying but has no understanding of the effect the things she says to me and how much they can mess with my head. It also got me thinking and here is one of my questions.........
1. Do you think that someone can develop ocd over their lifetime if they are constantly blamed for absolutely everything by other people. I mean, if you are constantly being told that you did wrong or you are to blame, its your fault that sooner or later it will sink in and that person will subconsciously begin to believe it and therefore ocd is then used as a coping mechanism to try and control THEIR responsibilities which are in fact other peoples? And also do you think that living in a negative household can have an effect on you? My parents have always been worriers and so I hate it when I will mention something and theyll immediately add something bad to it. For instance, I would like to go to japan, and my mum then brings up they they supposedly like to target european girls over there as reported in the newspapers apparently and so straight away she has put a nagative thought out there and installed a fear in me. My family do this all the time. Its no wonder I'm terrified of so many things in life! So do you think this could kick start if not then perhaps contribute to ocd at all?
The reason I'm asking this is because this is how I have been made to feel my whole life, even now by my parents but my mum in particular. This may sound stupid but I also wonder whether her threats to send me to boarding school when I was naughty when I was younger may have installed a permanent fear in me, in terms of that I need to feel in control to feel secure. Do any of you see what I mean?
The final questions of mine are below........
2. As an ocd sufferer myself I know all too well that I do things in case something bad happens like many of you. And I was just wondering, do you think we are convinced something like this may happen because perhaps something bad did happen in our lives before and we are being punished for them in some way or living in fear of doing it again. Me personally I cant think of anything offhand as such apart from something I said about someone once and I wish I hadnt said it and I feel bad for it. If everyone is honest, do you think this is the case? Do you think you have done something you regret or what another may find bad in some way and thats why you have ocd?
3. Lastly, I have been thinking about religion a lot recently. I have issues with religion when it comes to ocd and I have never been a religious person yet I wonder whether it might offer some guidance. If maybe I or indeed all of us need some sort of structure in our lives. Some rules. And ultimately lead to being a better and possibly ocd free human being. What do you think? Do you think it can help?
Well sorry for the essay but I had to get a lot off my chest. These questions have been on my mind for a while. Hope to read some replies soon! o) Thanks for listening x","['Rituals', 'anger', 'disgust', 'Food', 'Thought', 'regret', 'hope', 'fear', 'OCD']",[],"['OCD', 'anger', 'disgust', 'Thought', 'Rituals', 'fear', 'regret', 'Food', 'hope']",,1.0,,,
"Hi everyone
Have been browsing on this forums for years and have seen all the wonderful support everyone gives each other.
It has taken me this long to pluck up the courage to join, i have lived with severe OCD for 26 years and only sought help 3 years ago. I was given CBT but i didnt feel it was of benefit to me, i realise now that it was because it was more like person centred counselling. I was given no homework or tasks to do and have had 26 years to 'do this' so i was running rings around my therapist, my fear is that i do not trust therapists with the complexity of this disorder and have had some therapists in the past challenge my thoughts which totally traumatised me and just made me disassociate more.
My ocd themes have waxed and waned over the year but my 2 main theme are harm(hocd) and relationship(rocd) if i could give someone 10 million pound to take away the pain, guilt and shame this horrible nasty illness bares upon my life i would. I live with a physical illness where somedays i cant walk and i would rather have everyday like that than have this 'thing' in my head.
I have tried to not let it stop me from doing things in life, i work fulltime and have always tried to better myself, but sometimes its too much.
With the harm thoughts i have told myself for 26 i could never have a family and with the rocd it has tested everything about my beautiful partner who is my everything, but i'm not going to let it take my life. I am now pregnant and determined that it will not take away my happiness. Im not on any medication so you can imagine its kicking off like the bully it is testing my every waking moment. You know the sneaky thought 'you dont really want a baby, you can then leave your OH when then baby comes'.
i dont talk to my OH about my thoughts as thats all they are just garbage, but when the anxiety comes thats when everything feels so real and the urges to say things are so strong.
I have spoken to the psychatrist today and told him i want an urgent referral for some cbt, he is very old skool, but i do have a good relationship with him and he knows if i want something urgent then it must be real. i will be under high risk for my pregnancy for my physical illness and i will be asking for referral into perinatal mental health. i may not need it, but would rather be in the system than sit out of it.

"Hi all,
I only just phoned the helpline this morning, even though I've had the number for a few weeks now and of course they mentioned this website.
I've known about OCD and that I suffer from it for a few years now, although I've only just made an appointment to see the Doctor for the first time today. I suppose I've been putting it off because I feel it protects me. I'm 34 now but thinking back I probably started to develop it in my late teens. I'm a washer, I go through about two large anti-bac hand washes each week and I also use a lot of anti-bac wipes (about 8 packs each week) on myself and objects that I touch. I don't stand there for hours washing my hands, usually it's 2-3 times for about 1 min each time. As long as I don't touch anything that I feel could have germs I won't keep going to wash every few mins. One thing I notice that I do is that after washing my hands I can't turn the tap off using my hand as I feel the tap is contaminated so I always keep an old showergel bottle on the side of the bath and use that by pushing it against the tap to twist it tight, I also wash the showergel bottle regularly to keep it clean. I also hate it if anyone else, apart from my mum uses the toilet. I have to clean the rim of the toilet, toilet seat, wash basin, taps and door handles with wipes and bleach the interior of the toilet. I also hate touching door handles and don't like being touched by others either, I can do it but as long as I know I can wash later. I keep my own towels in my bed room and my own toilet rolls, I can't stand the thought of anyone else using them.
Sorry if this is a bit long, there's a lot more I could put down but I think this gives a good idea of my OCD. I'm also pretty down at the moment, not because of the OCD but other things. I've heard that OCD sufferers are more prone to depression anyway. I know the hand washing is common but how about some of the other things and is mine quite severe, compared to others?","['object', 'Thought', 'depression', 'OCD', 'toilet', 'washing hands', 'site']",[],"['washing hands', 'site', 'depression', 'object', 'Thought', 'toilet', 'OCD']",,1.0,,,
"Hi Guys,
Im new here and have been recently diagnosed with OCD really just wanted to get this off my chest if anyone has any advice or support it would be greatly appreciated.
I am a 29 year old male who is happily married, but for the last 7 years I have been so scared that my wife and I have had hiv due to a sexual encounter I had before we met. I have been constantly checking symptoms on both of us for years now while also spending hours upon hours reasearching hiv on the internet as well as laws and guidelines for doctors reporting positive hiv results because I just couldn't believe we did not have it, No matter how many tests were done nothing could take my worry away. I have discussed it with my wife and parents on many occassions only to get the same response """""""" your being silly"""""""" """"""""stop worrying"""""""" so I quietly went about my thoughts and worries and did not discuss them anymore.
9 weeks ago on Fathers day my wife took a pregnancy test as we had been trying for a baby ( which was silently playing havoc on my OCD trying for a baby while believing you have hiv is not a great place) the test was positive and I was over the moon I was going to be the best Dad ever! Then that very night all of a sudden out of know where I had one tiny little thought about bathing my baby/kid and what if I touched them what if i'm one of those people and just didn't know it yet.
I was paralysed trapped with fear and guilt and and overwhelming sense of not deserving to live I cried everyday for a week constant checking of horrible thoughts to ensure I wasn't excited by this, I couldn't watch television with children couldn't be around children or couldn't even go to the shops. I couldn't discuss it with anyone how could I? This was disgusting! This was tearing me apart from the inside out! How could I have not known for so many years I was going through my whole life with a fine toothed comb insuring I had never felt like this before ensuring I had never hurt a child before. A week later after next to no sleep and feeling like i didn't want to live any longer my wife and I took our dog to the park there was a father there playing with his children and I broke down I fell over in a heap and cried my eyes out ( just like i am now so hard to type this) I sat there and told my wife everything in detail from the hiv to my current situation that I honestly believed I was a pedophile. She of course broke down as well but being the most wonderful women in the world she supported me 100% ensuring me we would get through this however I needed to get some help. We found an intrusive thought website via google with a link to the anxiety hotline I called and they found me a phsycologist in my area. I have now been for 5 sessions and my OCD anxiety levels have dropped from a 10 to a 6-7 with the odd spike I'm am still not comfortable around children but i can keep it under control without having to run away and i am not forcing myself to check or rumitating for half an hour everytime i see or here a child. I am not taking any medication and I'm finding the CBT/ERP thereapy although extremely confronting, quite rewarding. However I am learning that OCD is something I will have my whole life I will never be cured just managed and that in itself is quite confronting knowing I will never be my worry free self but that's just it I could never forget these past 8 weeks or the 7 years before that everytime I here a word or see a news report it will always be there but as long as i can manage it and keep the anxiety extremely low I believe I can live a reativly normal life. If i can bath my baby and do the things that normal fathers do that I once took for granted then that will be normal enough for me.
My wife and I have just had our 12 week scan and and everything is fine and healthy.

I’ve just joined and thought I’d say Hi,.I've been an OCD sufferer now for 6 years. When I was first diagnosed with it, things were pretty bad, but I tolerated things until they got so bad that I'd had enough. I'm now booked of work, and so fed up, that was when I decided that something had to be done, I am not willing to live the rest of my life like this. I am lucky to have help through my doctor and the NHS and was able to start seeing someone, work then wanted me to see their counsellors and I'm now seeing someone else. I hate everything about OCD, I hate the checking, the rituals and the counting. Its destroyed my life, relationships, friendships and my good work record, I hate being on the tablets and above all else I hate the thought that I might never be able to overcome it. I want my life back, at the moment I dont lead a life, I just exist. Its hard to laugh and be happy, and hardly anything seems exciting anymore. I feel like my OCD has me by the throat, and each day I'm fighting for my breath, I have little fighting power left, some days I feel like surrendering to it, but what I want to do is find some fighting power, some guts, motivation and fight it, and maybe one day I may just defeat it......and defeat it before it defeats me. One of the toughest things with my OCD is feeling so alone and isolated, I don't know anyone who suffers from this, so if anyone is interested being friends and having a chat, please do give me a yell.
Regards to you all.","['checking', 'Rituals', 'interest', 'Thought', 'OCD']",[],"['interest', 'checking', 'Rituals', 'Thought', 'OCD']",,1.0,,,

"Hi All,
Im new to this site. Im so glad that im not the only one with this. Reading some of your messages has made me relise that some of you have the same feelings as i have.
My biggest problems with my OCD is that i am afraid that if i dont do my rituals then everything bad will happen. I make Good things seem like Bad things. I am always putting a downer on everything, i just can't have any fun anymore. I have obsessive hand washing with fears of touching magic items. I am worried that i am evetually going to push my wife away. I am letting it effect my day to day choirs, i can't even get excited about my new daughter. I have to get some help or im going to crack up and go mad.
I worry that if i dont do my rituals every day then somehow i control the way the world works and something bad will happen to someone
I have to put certain items in certain places facing certain ways and its getting stupid, our house looks like a bomb has hit it and its all because of me being silly.
Please if anyone has any advice and any help i would welcome you ideas.
Thanks

As the title says I'm new here, I'm from a wee town in Scotland and developed OCD 15 years ago at the age of 14, mainly excessive hand washing, struggling quite badly at the moment with everything going on and the last 3 years haven't been easy for me with blow after blow happening
I haven't had any help for my OCD and those close to me just say I'm being bloody stupid especially at the present time when I can barely walk away from the sink before having to go back and start all over again
Looking forward to having a little support around

"Helo, not sure where to begin but hope you can help me please.
I have been suffering depression for 4 years now. But I dont think it is depression. It stems from me having a fear of mouth cancer mainly. I check my mouth constantly, I have even got up in the night to check it for abnormal things. Every tiny thing I go to the dr and they tell me its all ok but I just dont believe them or trust them. I also cant watch anything on tv thats cancer related or read anything about cancer (any cancer) as fear literally floods through me.
The fear of the mouth cancer causes me to be depressed so its a vicious circle.
I also have problems in the bedroom department as I am convinced I smell. I am also convinced my breath smells. Hubby says I dont smell at all but i dont believe him, I am sure he is just being nice.
I have got mouth thrush from my steroid inhaler and have been treated but it didnt work, so today went to the dr in tears terrified its something more sinister and she said I channel my anxiety into this one thing and obsess over it, and I said """"""""like ocd?"""""""" and she said similar.
So I came home from Dr, googled OCD and found this site. I have been reading the forums and finally feel i """"""""fit here"""""""". I can totally understand some of the posts with the health issues and I also am developing an issue with using public toilets, washing my hands then having to touch the manky door handle on the way out, so now I carry that antibac hand gel everywhere!
I feel I understand and fit so well here I have left a message for the dr to call me tomorrow for a telephone appt to tell her what I have told you on here. I have not told her some of this as I mainly go in just crying saying i am miserable and whats this in my mouth?!
Does this sound like OCD to you or am I just mad?

"Hi
My name is Johnny and i've suffered with OCD probably since my teens. It got worse as I left school and had a hard time at college and continued for a few years until i thankfully got the rituals under control.
My main OCD rituals (if anyone wants to know :original: ) are number counting and having to fall on certain 'good' numbers and cant on 'bad numbers' Plus symmetry is a issue for me with objects having to be places in a certain way.
I also suffer from BDD which affects my OCD in that I do rituals related to my BDD that are based on my OCD i believe.

Although the past few years I feel I have got the BDD & OCD under control they still affect me daily especially when i'm overly anxious/stressed about things the rituals become more intensive. And lately after researching into it believe I have Pure OCD thoughts also which I want to tackle head on if I can but not sure how to.
Just looking to read and share experiences with OCD and talk to people about it as no one in my family knows I have OCD so I fimd it hard to keep it all to myself.

Johnny

"Hi I was unsure about this at first but I feel like I'm going to burst if I hold this in any longer. After 11 years (I'm currently 18) I eventually told my mother by text message that I think I have ocd. My greatest fear was that she wouldn't believe me but she did. Since that day near enough 2 weeks now she hasn't mentioned anything else to me so I don't know where to go from here. I don't want to bring it up again just in case she thinks I'm pestering her. Reading some of the comments on this site I do think I have ocd but then i don't know want to go to the doctors for them to tell me I don't and then I'll feel worse. I already had bad experience when I went for depression and was told I was """"""""just acting sad"""""""" which really upset me. The more I tell myself not to do repetitive things or rituals the more I do them. I tried to tell myself it was mind over matter but the other day I stood in the hallway tapping the skirting boards for what felt like ages and I couldn't move from the spot until I felt it was okay to move, my chest felt really tight. I just need help but I don't know how to get it and I'm embarrassed.

I found out about OCD when we were doing about it at school, and it got briefly mentioned. It's only recently that I've started wondering if I've got it, and read up on it on the internet. The thing is, half of the stuff I do as rituals don't come up as symtoms. Also, the rituals I do don't really take up massive amounts of time, although they do rather annoy me when someone interrupts me and I have to start again.

"Hi, my name is Polly. I'm 21 and have had a combination of anorexia, bullimia and ocd with history of self-harm (cutting) and panic attacks. I've been in treatment for my eating disorders and have made excellent progress in maintaining a healthy weight, sensible eating etc. At first my ocd behaviours increased as my control over food was going but now those have started to decrease in severity and frequency. I still have lots of problems with counting and checking rituals that I find time consuming, irritating and frankly bizarre. I'm on an anti-depressant (Sertraline) which I have found has really helped stabalise my moods and am far less anxious. A lot of my ocd behaviours are invisible to those around me, especially the counting ones but to me they're very real. I also have an incredible phobia of choking, to the point where it feel like I'm choking even if I'm eating a liquid based item e.g. soup. Has anybody else encountered this type of thing, it's just it feels so real but I know it's all psychological?? I've never had specialist treatment for my ocd and now I'm at the point where I don't think I'll ever really be free from it, this is as good as it gets. Am I right to think this? Can you ever truly make a full recovery to the point where you don't even have to think about fighting your ocd?
I'm moving into """"""""monitoring"""""""" as far as my treatment for my ed is concerned (they just keep tabs on me to check I'm doing ok) and I'm really scared my ocd will get worse as a result. Recently I have started pulling out hair (from my legs and under my arms) as I find it calms me down and relaxes me. Do any other sufferers do this, and is it technically ocd?
It was a hard decision for me to go onto anti-d's but things were so bad I pretty much didn't have a choice. If I forget to take a tablet, by the end of the day my ocd behaviours start to come back and I get incredibly anxious, does anybody else find this?
Sorry, I know this has been a bit of a ramble but I really want to be free from this, I'm 21 for gods sake. I have a good sense of humor and often laugh off my ocd as """"""""quirky"""""""" and """"""""interesting"""""""", people guess I have ocd before I've even told them...but inside it totally destroys me.

I'm struggling to figure out what to write. I don't quite know how to package my story to tell you all. It's been a messy few years.
I have very unusual rituals and this has led my OCD to be super treatment resistant. I'm potentially going into an intensive OCD specific treatment program and I'm terrified. It's sort of my last resort.
I don't have a great support system right now and am hoping to find people who understand here, I guess. If you're anything like me, you know how isolating this disorder can be.

"This is harder than I thought, How do i tell you about myself when I don't even know who myself is anymore?
I've been diagnosed with some type of OCD, they didn’t bother to go any deeper than that before they discharged me with a prescription for Prozac, blaming my social environment for my thoughts and behaviour. That was there official opinion and no further investigating needs to be done. So I feel very much on my own with it.
No point describing all my rituals because they're so varied and change over time but pretty much all of them apart from the ticks seem to focus around an overwhelming need to be polite and say/do things 'properly'.
Now, I’m 28 and up until August 2011 I didn’t care about anything, nice and polite but very placid and not a lot bothered me, almost to the point it was a flaw in my personality. Then around 3rd week in August something happened, I wish I knew what. I very suddenly began to care about everything, it started with how I said goodbye to people but quickly grew, I thought it was really weird at the time and that’s why I can remember the date.
I gave it a year, tried to get a grip of my thoughts but by then the rituals were, formal, deeper and more intrusive. That’s when I decided to go to the doctor. Now when they said it was environmental and prescribed Prozac, I didn’t agree that was the best course of action because I know the doctor will never take me off the anti-depressants once I've started them.
So I did some research and found a lot on information on serotonin and how it interacts with the brain. Kept seeing case studies of magic mushroom use and how it can relieve OCD symptoms, after a bit of further research into that. I tried them, before committing myself to a life on Prozac I thought it was worth a shot. And it worked! The symptoms have starting coming back now and obviously I can’t take magic mushrooms every few days, so I’ve started the Prozac. But my mini experiment leads me to believe my OCD is a chemical issue in my brain and not a result of environmental factors. I’m no scientist and I don’t want to mess with my brain chemistry too much but I got to try and get the old me back.

I'm new here. I've had OCD for about 20 years but looking back it first started when I was at School. However, the part about contamination, washing hands over and over again, clothes, etc only started just over 20 years ago.
I used to think I was made, that there was nobody else in the world like myself when I was young. At least I now know that a large number of people suffer from this and I hope to get support and give some if possible.
Sometimes I wash my clothes, wash my hands countless times, bleach the sink and wash taps and any surfaces that I think may be contaminated. I hate using public toilets and only do so if necessary and then use a tissue or paper to open the door.

I am 60. I've had intrusive upsetting thoughts for decades, round repeating themes, either about my relationship (we've been married over 40 years), my constant comparing of myself to other people (always unfavourably), my envy of others (I'm deeply ashamed of this as it's worse with people I know well, even some family members) and my inability to feel happy for others' happiness or success.
There is nothing in my life at the moment which needs to change substantially - apart from my thoughts which lead to anxiety and depression. But as a result of my anxieties and thoughts, I find it hard to enjoy my life or appreciate what I have.

"Hi Im Dale.
I have just found this website today after looking up various things to do with OCD.
I recently split up with my girlfriend back last year so I decided to go to the doctors to seek help as I could not do anything that I enjoyed and was totally obsessed with her
and don't have one minute a day that I dont think about her, and when those thoughts come I feel a big wave of depression through me.
He initially prescribed me 50mg of sertraline a day, I started taking this and it made me feel really really bizzare, I felt like i'd been given speed or something but at the same time felt spaced right out and could not drive and was having serious panic attacks, I went back to him today and had a long chat and started telling him about things I do that I feel are irrational and effecting my every day life, so he changed me promptly to a different medication and said the previous one did not agree with me, and said I might be suffering from OCD as well as depression.
I have a few questions if I may, and i'd love to know if any of these things are related in any way to OCD.
Common symptoms that I suffer from which I beleive to be OCD are.
Having little rituals like when parking the car outside the house I have to do things in a certain order, like press the engine off button, then the lights, then set the radio on a certain channel and volume, making sure the steering is totally straight before the car locks the steering otherwise I gotta do it again, Turning the T.V. off on channel 3, all lights switches that work on a 2 way circuit have to be in the off position on both switches (i.e. the hall turns the upstairs light on and off, but when I go to bed it's gotta be in the off position downstairs, even though the upstairs switch turns it off it has to be off downstairs or it will drive me nuts).
If I think I saw a word somewhere or item, picture anything I keep thinking I have to go back and look to see if it was what I saw, if not it drives me nuts!.
Things all have to be equal, like I had tyres fitted to the car and they are all the same tyre, same model, same tread pattern, but he only had 3 V rated tyres, and 1 W rated which is just a higher speed capability, but it drives me mad thinking there is a odd tyre on my car! even though it's not.
Everything has to be straight and aligned perfectly, if not it drives me mad.
If the room gets slightly messy I have to tidy it up, and cannot stand things out of place, but if it gets in a serious mess it doesnt bother me.
I work as a engineer and I took 30 screws out of a machine the other day, a couple of them are gold in colour, all the same types of screw, but when I put all the screws back in I realised there was a silver one where a gold one was, and it drove me mad and I had to take it all apart to put the gold one back where I thought it would go.
Dirt and dust drive me insane, but i'm not worried about germs on my hands, but am worried about catching a serious disease and sometimes worry sick im gonna get a serious disease.
I fuss over things being totally organised, like my tools, cutlery draw, boot, desk.
superstitious stuff drives me mad, like walking on 3 drains etc, and i get depressed if i forget and walk on them.
I sometimes get horrible thoughts in my head like, a member of the family is gonna die in an accident or something and cos I thought about it I think it will happen, or talking to someone I think about hitting them or something (even though they are being really nice, and I wouldnt do that), even horrible sexual thoughts and I have to think other things to block them out.
I will add more to this section but I can't think off the top of my head now what else, but there are loads.
Other things that I do but im not sure if it's OCD or something else, and i'd love to know if anyone else suffers with them
I get in a relationship with someone, but I constantly worry about it, and analyse it. Then I feel I have to say something about it cos im worried, but cos i've said something about being worried I worry even more, then I say something again apologising over bringing something up it keeps going in a vicious circle and I feel the relationship is then doomed and I start suffering really bad with anxiety.
When the relationship is over I cannot stop thinking about them, the thoughts of anything good or bad is in my head 24 hours a day and wont go away, I feel completly obsessed by them even if it was someone that I didnt even like, I start to convince myself that I must have liked them, and it makes me depressed and I cant do things I enjoy.
If i've moved the house around and something bad happens after I have moved it, I will feel depressed and put it back the way it was when things were good, or somethings I dont like throwing out cos it was there when things were good.
I'm addicted to looking around shops, even though I dont want anything, but it makes me happy to buy something, I keep looking for something that I might want, or is cheap. Then I get depressed when I spend my money, then realise after playing with it for a bit that I didnt really want it and take it back for a refund.
I buy say a T.V. but I get it home and i'm not happy with it, so I keep taking it back for a different model, I ended up with 6 different models of T.V. recently and I wasnt happy with any. But yet I looked for weeks and weeks to buy it, and read 100's of reviews, I just could not decide on the one I wanted and spent hours in different shops.
When I go food shopping or clothes shopping I take like 2 hours as I cannot make a decision on what product to buy, and keep putting stuff back and picking up different brands, I read almost every label on the product to help me to decide what one I want, then when I do decide I have to check all the sell by dates to make sure I've got the freshest one in the shop!. Everyone who comes shopping with me doesnt understand why im so indecisive,I just cannot decide what product/brand I want to buy, and I will constantly ask who ever is with me opinions, and even then I cant decide. sometimes I have to go to more than one shop cos im sure it's cheaper or better value for certain items.
If I buy more of one item that is the same they all have to be exactly the same.
I recently bought 6 soldering irons as they were cheap, I planned on keeping one for myself and selling the rest in work, but I had to check each one of them and I had to keep the one that worked perfectly, some then had higher flames than others, some made different noises and it drove me mad to find the perfect one.
I recently bought a brand new car, and little tiny parking dents and things have made me not want to clean the car any more, and am thinking ordering another new car.
I hope im not going mad lol, i've always suffered with all of these but i'm started to realise it's making my life difficult.
Thanks for taking your time to read this.

"Hi everyone. I joined a few weeks ago but never posted because i was feeling much better the past few weeks. I have been suffering with anxiety, ocd and depression for about 25 years. I am in therapy now and my doctor is changing my meds right now. My prozac pooped out after 16 years and my doctor has switched me to paxil. I was doing well for a few weeks but this past week I have felt myself feeling like the anxiety, ocd and depression are coming back. I have dealt with just about every type of ocd but I have mostly been dealing with pure o. I am always ruminating about the past.
***
I dont know if this is going to make any sense to anyone. I started obsessing and worrying about not being able to know the difference between a dream or a thought and reality. I was driving on a friends lane towards his farm and I looked at one of the fields and thought maybe they had harvested some and turned the soil. Then i thought let me check the large soybean field and see if they harvested. I dont know if i had a thought in my mind that they harvested or maybe i had dreamed about it later at another time. I really didnt think about it until i drove by the field on another day and thought the field had been harvested. When i drove by it wasnt harvested. That freaked me out because i was picturing it in my mind that it had been harvested and the soil turned. Did i possibly see a different farm and just get it mixed up or can i not tell the difference between thoughts, dreams and reality? That then made me think of another time of not knowing if i dreamed something or if it was real. Now im worried about having thought that an old friends husband had died in a car accident many years ago. I had thought for many years that someone had told me that. Then when i was obsessing a couple years ago about it i had myself thinking that i dreamed it because i couldnt remember for sure if someone had told me. I spoke with someone yesterday who told me that my friends husband did die in a car accident many years ago. Now im ruminating and thinking that i cant tell the difference between dreams, thoughts and reality. I dream about a lot of things and now im starting to wonder if i ever visited my friends years ago when my first daughter was born. I dont know if i really did or if i just thought about visiting or if i dreamed it. So scared i cant tell the difference. If i made a mistake with the car accident its possible i could make a mistake with other things too. Things like harm ocd. I suffer a lot from harm ocd and hyper-responsibility ocd. I usually am able to get passed those by telling myself i dont remember completely and i am just having ocd false memories. I did that with thinking about my friends husbands car accident. If i was wrong then, then i could be wrong about a lot of other thoughts, dreams and reality moments from the past and also in the present and future. Im just having so much fear and doubt. I just want to cry. Well here come the tears.

"Um hi everyone (Sorry but I'm not sure this is where I'm meant to post but I'm a bit confused so sorry if I waste your time)
So basically I'm here because my psychologist (or whatever they are, I really don't know all too much about it, sorry) said it would be a good idea. This is the first time I have really talked to anyone properly about my OCD that isn't a family member or anything.
I have had OCD as long as I can remember (I'm 14 in a few weeks) and now it is getting worse. I believe I also have depression, as I have read about it online, but I am yet to discuss this with anyone. I often have suicidal thoughts and feel worthless and I am ill all the time.
My OCD centres around germs and everything feeling balanced but I'm not very good at explaining things, so sorry about that. I also have excessive guilt issues which people often find annoying.
My OCD has worsened within the past six months when I moved out of my Mum's house to live with my Dad. I have a better relationship with my Mum now but I don't go there often as I can't handle my little sister's germs. I love her so much but she says I'm 'fussy' because I constantly ask her if she has washed her hands etc.
I know people at my school dislike me as I am a very angry person and I get wound up very easily. I don't have any friends really in school that actually like me and I know I am not being paranoid because somebody told me. I can handle my germ-related OCD at school better but after working really hard for my Primary School years I am now failing most of my classes right before GCSEs because of the amount of time I spend off school due to OCD-related anxiety/depression/hate for school when I used to love it.
Basically it's just taking over my life and I am finally getting help after about 10 years of trying but after around 7 weekly visits, I still feel like I'm not being listened to. I feel like my psychologist person hates me and I don't know what to do.
I'm so sorry this is so long but this is the first time I have actually spoke this much about it and this is only about 1/1000 of what I feel. You don't have to read it all or reply but thank you so much to anyone who does. My situation is probably way better than some of yours though so sorry if I sound pretentious or selfish or something :/
Thank you

"Hi all
this is my first time here, just trying to work out how to do this! I don't know where to start really, hope my story doesn't bore you all too much (sorry in advance if it does!) Just feel like i've got to get this off my chest..
I've had 'pure o' since I was about 9 (I'm now 31) and went through secret hell with it (various themes) until I eventually got help when I was 19 and diagnosed with OCD. I was put on medication for about a year and saw a CPN for a while & I seemed to get much better. I felt free for the first time since I was little & went off to university looking forward to the future. Well, things went well for about the next six months, until I got into my first serious relationship and started to obsess about him going off me. The stress built up & up and eventually one day pure O kicked in totally - I actually became obsessed that I was going to be unfaithful to my boyfriend! (even though I loved him very much and there was no real chance of this happening). Anyway, things got very bad & I had to go back on medication, which worked a treat - once again I got my life back on track. For the next ten years I stayed on medication (not sure how this happened but I seemed to be kind of forgotten about i guess). I was managing my OCD very well during this time & I was living a really 'normal' life (free from all the pain), so six months ago I made the big decision to come off medication. Well, this is when things started to go wrong. Firstly, I was on Seroxat and was taken off it over just 2 weeks & the withdrawal symptoms were terrible. However, after about a month things seemed to be settling down & I started to feel a bit better. Then (out the blue) I had my first ever real panic attack during the night, and since then it has got worse and worse. Then pure O kicked in again, and now (3 months on) I have just been diagnosed with generalised anxiety disorder as well as having OCD. I have become obsessed that I don't love my boyfriend (although I know in the non-ocd part of my head that I love him with all my heart) and I am constantly anxious and feel panicky about everything. I am actually anxious about becoming anxious, which inevitably brings it on. I am trying to be strong but am becoming more and more depressed about it all - I really regret ever trying to come off my medication and am terrified that i'm never going to get back to where i was & feel 'normal' again. Last month my psychiatrist put me back on (new) medication, but so far it doesn't seem to be working. I also see a psychologist on the NHS but she has just told me that I already know all the answers and I have to help myself. The trouble is I don't feel strong enough to help myself, feel so alone and starting to think that no-one can help me. Just continuing living is such a struggle right now, sometimes I feel like I can't take much more (my mind is so messed up & I feel like I'm really going mad sometimes). I am also hyperaware all the time *(I think that's the right term) Can't stop analysing how I am, which sets off all the anxiety etc. again. I'm so sorry this email has been so long and moaning - just don't know where else to turn & am desperate to talk to people who know how this feels, no one else really understands","['hope', 'Anxiety disorder', 'regret', 'email', 'anxiety', 'anxiety', 'OCD', 'Medication', 'symptom']",['theme'],"['anxiety', 'OCD', 'Anxiety disorder', 'email', 'symptom', 'regret', 'theme', 'Medication', 'hope']",1.0,,,,
"Hello. My name is Lily but I'm not quite sure if I'm in the right place here or not. I wonder if you guys can help me.
My GP has diagnosed me with OCD but I'm not sure he's correct. Two of my best friends have OCD and it's nothing like my problem.
I think my problem is more like a pure phobia - a phobia of illness/disease (which started when I was very ill years ago, and in so much chronic pain that I was considering ending my life).
This leads me to protect myself from infection/germs etc with excessive hygiene precautions (using antibacterial hand foam and wipes more than other people) and be extremely anxious if I am exposed to a clear risk of infection (like shaking hands with someone who has something infectious like a cold sore or a fungal nail infection).
There's no ritual or pattern to my behaviours - my use of antibacterial foam/wipes is excessive, but is only in response to whatever I'm in contact with. My anxiety when I'm exposed to infection is extreme, but once I've done what I can to limit the risk of infection (washing my hands, using antibac wipes, sometimes throwing my clothes away), the anxiety is then just anxiety - I don't continue to do any behaviours (because it's too late).
So is this OCD then? It seems more like phobia/anxiety to me but maybe this sort of thing is all grouped together for diagnostic purposes? I'm having a really hard time with it at the moment so I need to find some help, but I don't know where to go.
Any opinions would be much appreciated. Thanks.","['disease', 'shaking', 'washing hands', 'OCD', 'anxiety', 'anxiety']",['excessive'],"['shaking', 'disease', 'anxiety', 'washing hands', 'excessive', 'OCD']",,1.0,,,
"Hi
I am in my 40's and now married with kids. I have suffered with what I have determined as OCD since school.
My symptoms are that I feel I have to touch things all the time. As a child I had something in my head saying if I didn't 't do something, something would happen. This was really difficult when it came to studying as I would write long passages etc and screw it up and start again. At times I would walk back home and back to school again because I 'had' to.
In my adult life this has continued but I never carry out any 'rituals' when people are around me. If I am alone it can take me a long time to leave the house due to the need to check, touch things, turn lights off and on etc. Even locking the car I will have to walk around and kick all the wheels or something.
Someone told me many years ago this could stem from catholic guilt due to all you're ever told is that If you do x then y will happen.
When I write this down it all sounds crazy, but I have reached the point now where it needs to be gone.
Does anyone share any similar symptoms or habits? Cleanliness etc is not an issue, it's all ritualistic.
Many thanks","['OCD', 'Rituals', 'guilt', 'symptom']",[],"['symptom', 'Rituals', 'OCD', 'guilt']",,1.0,,,
"Hi everyone,
i feel a bit silly joining this site as i havent actually been diagnosed with OCD because i havent been to the doctors to discuss it…so a little bit of a background (which is actually scary to think i'm going to start writing what i do down!)
My mum suffered with OCD when i was a teenager, she seeked advice from a healthcare professional and she saw a psychologist...her thing was cleanliness, and a little bit of safety which they worked out that came from a old memory of betrayl from her dad from her younger years.
So i spent quite a bit of time with my parents as a teenager, this was during the stage that Mum started to think this way, so I became her back up…but dealt with it in what now seems the incorrect way, I’d encourage her, I was young so I didn’t know what to do, so when she went over a bump in the road and asked me if she’d just run someone over, instead of saying, no mum that’s silly, I said no mum you didn’t, but for piece of mind…lets go back and check…birthplace of the thoughts I have today? Maybe!
So my checks aren’t really to do with contamination or bad sexual thoughts like some write on here, mine’s more safety and harmful thoughts, this weekend was the worst for me which is why I’ve decided to start looking into help, but I have had these checking things for longer than I can remember now.
This weekend my husband stayed away, leaving me in the house by myself for 3 nights, which I did not sleep a single wink of on any of them because I was petrified that someone was going to break in (we’ve moved into this house within the last 2 months from a secure entry flat before that). Now I know people get scared and that’s normal, but not being able to close your eyes because you think that the moment that you do will be the moment you’ve let your guard down and that’s the moment that your attacker will choose to get you, and then playing out the situations of how you’ll deal with it…what will I throw, will I throw anything, or will I try to shut the door, but then what if my Chihuahua runs out there and they hurt him instead so i just sat up all night watching disney movies to try and distract me from the thoughts...but then what if by the TV being on i cant hear them and then they catch me unawares
So that was this weekend, my other checks are daily, making sure that the back door and front door and windows are locked, but by me checking it, have I now unlocked it…best go check…I’ve even taken pictures and videos of myself doing this to prevent myself going back…but sometimes still not good enough so I still have to go back and make myself late for work
Then there’s my now un-straightened hair, I cant do my hair of a morning because I think that I will leave my straighteners on, and then they will burn the whole row of houses down and it’ll be my fault because I wanted straight hair that day.
I struggle with the thoughts of my husband and my dog dying…like I think I’m going to go home every day to a dead dog, or if my husband goes somewhere for work that he wont make it, then what will I do, how will I cope without him.
I also don’t like odd numbers, when i say i dont like them ,i mean i cant deal with it, it makes me feel a panic in my chest and i just have to change it...if the volume on the tele is on an odd number or if there's an odd number of items like, I’ve recently broken a few glasses in my new kitchen which has left me with 3 glasses and I’ve also lost 3 spoons…leaving me with crying at the thought of having just 3 spoons, people just say why don’t you just buy 1 or 3 more but I cant because then they wont match and everything has to match even down to colour and brand when buying shampoos and deodorants etc…
So I feel stupid, I feel like these are all normal things, and when I try to discuss them with anyone other than my mum they just say o yeh I do that…or well just don’t think about it….i think about everything excessively, if I don’t know something I will literally pull the situation apart and wont stop until I then know that thing,
I have an excessive need to be right all the time and for everything to be perfect, my work says that I’m too competitive and I also take the blame for everything…I will always find a way of transferring things so that its my fault and then get defensive and sometimes nasty because I feel I’ve wronged someone.
I’m a incredibly proud person and I pride myself in being strong, my family have been through a lot and I myself have been through a lot of emotional situations, and I’m always deemed to be the strong one…probably why yesterday was the first day I opened up to anyone about it, a little bit to my husband followed by a conversation with my mum…the only one I feel understands…..so that’s it…i dont know if i have ocd, whether its mild or moderate or whether i am just like everyone says just doing normal things that evryone else is doing too...

"Hi Everybody,
I just discovered this forum and I am happy there is something like this that exists. I think it is VERY HELPFUL to know that I am not alone because OCD is so isolating.
I have suffered from this illness ever since I can remember. I was officially diagnosed when I was 20 (I'm 42 now) by a councilor at my college because I was having a very difficult time...but looking back, I remember going through OCD episodes as a kid but didnt know what it was.
Even though I think I have experienced almost every kind of OCD symptoms that exist from excessive hand washing to checking the stove repeatedly before leaving my apartment to driving around the block because I thought I hit a person or animal, but the main focus of my OCD is constantly having horrific thoughts that terrible things are going to happen to people that I love. I also think that sometimes I am going to cause these things to happen if I don't """"""""correct things"""""""". Even though this sounds pretty standard as far as OCD goes, I have so many layers and nuances that affect me that I dont think I could even explain all of them. I tend to feel so caught up in these and feel completely lost in my own head.
A more recent development in my OCD is that I feel like I see signs of terrible things to come. For example, if I have a """"""""bad thought"""""""" then immediately look at my computer screen and I see a family member's or friend's initials within a word, that means that something terrible is going to happen to that person. Or if I have a bad thought then see a number that corresponds with someone's birthday, that's a sign that something bad will happen to that person. I try to rationalize that I am not psychic nor are these occurrences signs but i get overwhelmed with fear. Sometimes more than one """"""""sign"""""""" happens in a row which then paralyzes me with fear even more. I get confused that maybe these are real signs. It gets to be too much for me. I pray alot for relief but that ends up being very difficult for me because I start having blasphemous thoughts while I pray so then my praying ends up going in circles because I am apologizing for the sinful thoughts and it never ends. I am not a religious person in the sense that I follow an organized religion but I do believe in a greater power and I pray because that is the best thing I can do because I get so scared and feel helpless. It's just difficult when the thing that you look to for relief gets contaminated and then it all goes downhill from there.
There is a television show on in the states called """"""""Obsessed"""""""" which follows OCD sufferers through their treatment. For that one hour a week when I watch it, I feel normal. The burden is lifted because I know that I have an illness instead of thinking that I am a bad person which I tend to think quite a bit because of the terrible thoughts I have. I also feel lucky that I am able to have a mostly normal life compared to those poor people on the show who are debilitated by the sickness. I can relate though because there have been times in my life where OCD was totally in control and I wasnt able to do much. I don't tell many people I have OCD and when I do, I never go into the details for fear they would look at me differently afterwards. I think that most people just think I'm a bit quirky but that's because my OCD symptoms become visible sometimes when I don't do a good job at controlling them. I dont want to be thought of as the quirky guy though.
Thanks for taking the time to read this. I hope that someone relates to my words and knows they are not alone. I refuse to let this sickness win!","['checking', 'Treatment', 'hope', 'symptom', 'fear', 'Thought', 'OCD']",['excessive'],"['OCD', 'Treatment', 'fear', 'checking', 'Thought', 'excessive', 'symptom', 'hope']",,1.0,,,
"Hi.I am new here and i am really very confused.I don't know if i really have OCD or not which makes my condition all the more torturous.So while researching on OCD i found this group and thought of coming here and talking with the people who actually suffer from this illness.Maybe i can get some help here.I would really appreciate it if someone helps me.So,the thing with me is that i have these very weird habits.i have a habit of obsessing over sheer illogical and utterly meaningless thoughts.I have this constant fear that something bad will happen to my family.like if i don't write a particular word in certain 'way',something bad will happen.i have to cut a particular word over and over again until i succeed in convincing myself that what i am doing is completely illogical or until it feels 'right'.I have read some articles and in all of them i find that the most common of symptoms are washing hands,checking,hoarding,etc.but i don't have any of that.but i have this extreme phobia of sticky organic substances and whenever i am around such things i feel panicky.i mean right now just writing about it seems very hard.i have to like mentally cleanse myself.i know how weird this sounds.i find i weird too and therefore i am very scared all the time.and this mental cleansing is not just limited to physical things.I also get triggered by other things which i think to be impure(highly illogical).Like this time when i was on the internet and i saw this picture of a dead person and i was so full of fear and panic.i thought if i see any of my loved ones now something bad will happen to them.I mean how illogical is that?but i couldn't convince myself in anyway.i fought and fought and fought with my brain but just could not get over that thought.then i went and washed my eyes and then just to be sure i looked at myself in the mirror so that if my eyes were still impure it will just be me.it is so weird.So weird,really.And this was not an isolated incident.it happens all throughout the day.my brain feels like it is an antenna with nerve endings protruding out of it,ready to pick up any trigger.i am always on edge,always scared.i also have some weird habit of repeating certain words in my head and sometimes even out loud.but i try to control it.I am also uncomfortable in the presence of certain sounds and sharp objects like needles,pins or even pens sometimes but this fear is relatively easy to control.i get uncomfortable when i am near a corner or anything like stain.But all my symptoms are not very visible.it's just inside my brain.nobody except my family notices my weirdness.but it is very tiring.i get exhausted fighting with my own brain all day and all night.Can anybody tell me what i am suffering from?it certainly isn't normal.Is it?Because sometimes i think maybe i am just too lazy and too weak.maybe i suffer because i let my brain control me.i am really confused.And this is taking a toll on my self esteem.Thanks in advance.","['talking', 'washing hands', 'checking', 'writing', 'object', 'OCD', 'symptom', 'fear', 'Thought']",[],"['talking', 'washing hands', 'object', 'fear', 'writing', 'checking', 'Thought', 'symptom', 'OCD']",,1.0,,,
"i have suffered from OCD for 12 years. i am 20 years old.
my ocd:
1)
I get a intrusive thought, image or command to do something. thought of bad thing, or someone who had bad thing happen to them.
Belief: thinking bad things will cause them to happen to me
Thought: now this will happen to me
Actual commands: don’t do this, do this, now or between now and now
How do i justify thinking bad thoughts will cause them to happen to me. I believe it is god telling me the commands, Yes i believe this. i believe i can talk to god. is this OCD?
i AM SEEING a therapist, doctor.
is it true, is god talking to me, because for the last 12 years i have believed it, that is why when i have an intrusive thought, i justified that it can affect reality since god can control all. thus i get massive anxiety and do repetitive rituals by thinknig things like """""""" it wont happen to me"""""""" to releive the anxiety.

"Hello,
I'd say I gone from the age of 14 to this day suffering with OCD. I am now 29. Over the years I have had many forms of it. I say this cos i've read nearly every single post on this website and researched about ocd for the past week. by the way it was a godsend to find this website. But nobody knows i suffer from ocd or any mental illnes for that matter. No body has a clue not even my folks. After all the years suffering its amazing how you can hide it. I am 99.99% certain i have Pure O. Can't recall ever having the compulsive behaviour(i.e washing, checking etc...).
Researching for the past couple of days has helped me enormously already. I've ordered some books aswell. BUT i have heard so many stories about people going from gp to gp, been put on different medication, waiting for years to find the right professional to help them. If anyone on this site knows or knows of a good therapists who deals with OCD in the Dublin area please reply to this post.

"I just left a post for someone and was wondering how many people actuall hide their ocd from family and friends succesfully. Although i realise its not the right thing to do in terms of recovery, it still is something that i guess most of us sufferers actually do.
Ive suffered since i was eight and at 29 years of age i've realised that very few people actually know about my ocd, i only told my mother recently and she had no idea whatsoever( however i did find out then that she is actually a mild sufferer, but thats a different story).
After telling my friends i,ve found that i still hide it from them and that i do it without thinking. The only person that sees me perform rituals, or the problems obsessive thoughts cause is my girlfriend.

"Partner and I fell in love with a new grey VW car,  we shopped about so as not to rush in to anything, it’s an expensive car. We decided to go with first one we test drove.
Partners mate works for VW as a salesman so got us a great deal. We were just about to go back to him and sign up when we saw exactly the same car but in a different shade of grey in another branch. Exact money, minimal difference in mileage. If we go for that  colour VW would need to get it transported down, which is fine.
I had day off today and partner said go and see the two shades of colours, make a decision. He doesnt mind which grey.   But if he had to choose for him it’s non metallic urano grey over the metallic iridium grey.
I was looking after my sisters 11month old today also but he was fine in his carry seat but it wasn’t easy in a car show room with a baby.
Both shades of grey cars were side by side,  I was immediately drawn as preference  to the metallic one (iridium). The original one we fell in love before we knew of this other shade is non metallic, base grey with a gloss (urano).  I was just about to sign up to the iridium one when I changed my mind last minute.
This was because I made a comment re the grey on another car that I didn’t like and the salesman said that’s the same as the metallic you’re getting just in the sun.
I then did a complete 360, and due to a text from partner when I prompted that he liked the non metallic I signed up to the original one.
NOW HERES THE ANXIETY I’M FULL OF SELF DOUBT, IM QUESTIONING MY DECISION, I GOT IN SUCH A STATE, THAT I KEPT GOING OVER AND OVER WITH PARTNER THAT MAYBE I SHOULDN'T HAVE CHOSEN THE ORIGINAL, MADE THE SUDDEN SWAP AND HOW METALLIC IS MORE ATTRACTIVE.  BUT THEN I WASNT SURE IF I WANTED TO CHANGE ALSO. I ENDED UP IN TEARS AND FOR MY PARTNER ALL THE EXCITEMENT OF THIS NEW CAR HAS GONE, MY SELF DOUBT AND RUMINATION KILLED THAT.

"I have suffered with what I would call Pure O since 17 on and off. Sometimes mild sometimes debilitating. My OCD tends to be around my sexuality and fear of HIV (although today I am not frightened of HIV soo much),
Anyway it basically is that I think I have committed an unsafe sexual act with a person and therefore I will have to wait 3 months to know if infected or not.
However, I know rationally I did not commit said act if at all get intimate with anyone. I have not suffered an attack of this for a good 3 years and though my brain was over it.
Last weekend I knew I put myself in a position that could trigger an attack but thought it wouldn't as my OCD was over..... Apparently its not.
I now keep telling myself that I had unprotected sex with someone (which I know I didn't). So the usual process starts.
OCD -""""""""You had unprotected sex"""""""" Me - """"""""No I didn't"""""""" Ok so lets replay the event in my head. Me """"""""So thats what happened see no such thing"""""""" OCD """"""""are you sure?"""""""" and on and on it goes. To the usual """"""""im not getting into this it didn't happen so leave me alone"""""""" OCD """"""""Oh you dont gat away that easily I'm going to play and play on your mind. if you try to push me aside Ill sit on your chest in the form of anxiety to remind you im still there. Or I might give you a weird headache that tablets cannot cure.
I do know today though that it will pass and the """"""""spike"""""""" will subside over time. So im off to my docs for for REF for CBT on Wednesday. I cannot put it off any more. You see when I feel better I don't like to talk about it for fear it will cause a new Spike.
How insane it must sound to tell someone """"""""Oh by the way I had unsafe sex with someone but I know that I didn't and now its consuming my every thought"""""""" Its like a record stuck on a scratch. Wish It would just move along.

"Hey everyone,
Had a bad day yesterday, got really worked up and upset
In brief my HIV fears have returned with vengeance. Same old situation,
Went out Xmas eve with girlfriends stuck to 4 drinks, had a great night remembered
the entire evening and got a taxi home by myself, which I remember.
Had been fine until yesterday and my OCD just flared up, normally it’s the day after I have any alcohol. I did stick to my 4 drink limit and drunk water and juice in between too, but for some reason cruel OCD telling me that “maybe I don’t remember the taxi drive and that I got raped and now have HIV”
I’m doing exercises from CBT, but I can’t seem to stop ruminating and trying to replay the taxi journey home to check I didn’t black out and get raped (would think i would know if I've been raped)
As you guys will know I have had these same fears in past, which I ended up getting blood tests after each spike at 3 month mark to make sure I don’t have HIV and haven’t infected my boyfriend.

I forgot to pay attention to make sure the nurse used a fresh needle. I'm sure she did as she seemed professional and it was a clean clinic. She used a butterfly needle. But of course my OCD doesn't allow me to get over it. I keep thinking """"""""what if she didn't use a new needle??"""""""" It could have hiv blood in it!"""""""" Now I'm convinced because I didn't observe her open a new needle I now have hiv. I'm trying to find affordable therapy at the moment but my insurance covers nothing. I'm being irrational right? This is nothing to worry about? Thank you all in advance

"Hello! I need some help with my HIV OCD. Can you get HIV from invisible amount of fluid (unseen by naked eye)? For example:
Today, I went to my school's toilet and while washing my hands, I noticed my shirt touched the sink ( which was all covered with water drops because someone before me apparently splashed alot of water on the sink), and then few minutes later, I touched the shirt on the spot where it touched the sink and I continued doing my bussines. Now, my question is:
If there was any HIV contaminated fluid on the sink, which have touched my shirt, and then I touched the shirt on that spot where fluids might be, but without feeling or seeing any fluid on my hands, is there a way for HIV to spread like this? This really scares me because I've read online that HIV can be spread by invisible amounts od blood (in needle etc.),. Any comment is appriciated, thank you!

"I think this is quite a common theme now, or at least I seem to trip over it quite a lot on here - and I personally know no less than 3 completely different people with it !
It has also found its way on TV a number of times, though not always in a helpful way.
So from them I have learned that they just don't want to part with anything, even though they haven't used it, or don't anticipate doing so anytime soon. They say they can never get it again, might someday need it, or whatever.
And one only cleared their loft in order to have a loft conversion - fortunately the compulsive urge for more living accomodation overcame the desire to hold on to vast amounts of stuff.

"Hi ppl, hope everyones well. I've been doin exposure the past couple months and the rituals have died down alot, however, theres something that i cant blank out. I had this ocd before and then it just went, now its back.
Whenever im doing or thinking about something I want i.e. some food or sleeping the ocd associates things I dont want with it, but its not just images, its feelings aswell. Like it says imagine how a girl feels about a guy, but imagine you were the girl WTF! When blanking it its constantly saying your ignoring it because you want it, but I know I dont, ive always been with girls and never wanted to do anything with a person of the same sex, even writing this now OCD is saying """"""""somethings gunna happen now"""""""" If that makes sense.
When I really wanted a drink the other day (you know when you have needed a drink for some time) and the feeling of FINALLY getting a drink, its a good feeling, well my ocd says """"""""imagine how it feels to finnaly get a drink but picture an image, feeling or something sexual about that moment! half the time i just end up not drinkin at all, the same with food aswell.

"Hi everyone
I was diagnosed with OCD a few months ago, but I couldn't really """"""""accept it"""""""" or better Iat first I was relieved to find that it was just it and i was not really gay but then I started to doubt that I actually had that disorder and I wasn't just in denial.
It's still very hard for me to tell, sometimes i'm like """"""""pff you're crazy, you're not a lesbian you know it"""""""" but then if I don't find """"""""convincing explanations"""""""" to that I get a lot of anxiety because it's like I just don't want to and I have no real reasons.
Then sometimes I'm not so anxious about the idea and it makes me even more anxious cause it's like iìm accepting it and I hate this feelings. Or other times I feel a nice guy or a guy I used to like and I feel relieved for the first minute and then ocd thoughts come in and starts telling me that it's too bad that I don't really like girls because the are so pretty (WTF) and I get really scared by these thoughts.
Now the point of this topic is that tonight I was looking for information (reassurence) in the internet and I found a website where a guy was trying to explain to a group of gay people that didn't believe in hocd that it was a real disease and not just something """"""""gay people in denial"""""""" invented.
He told them all the things that everyone who has HOCD knows about it, like the symptoms or the anxiety, the """"""""groinal responses"""""""" the false attraction and so on, and hose gay people didn't believe a word he said, they said that it's not true that """"""""all gay people enjoy their gay thoughts"""""""" or that a lot of gay people experienced fulfilling heterosexual relationship before finding out that they were gay.
so what should I believe? that I don't have hocd? that it doens't even exists?
I have always only been """"""""emotionally"""""""" attracted to guys, never girls, it never really crossed my minds, but when ocd started I was obsessed by the fact that I liked women's body (I'm fat so I envy pretty much every girl I see) besides I have no experience with guys (eventhough I've always only wanted to be emotionally attached to a guy , just the thought of that is giving me butterflies) but now as I go on with this ocd is like I'm """"""""learning"""""""" so much about sexuality and I am not liking what I am learning, because it makes me even more scare to think that there isn't just """"""""black or white"""""""" that people might engage in opposite sex relationships and then find out that they are gay, or that some people like both girls and guys, or that the fact that I've always only liked boys (im not even sure if I listen to hocd) doens't mean much because I might have changed in my teen years (I'm 21). So what?? I'm going crazy. I'm too shy to make a move towards a guy, I feel relieved for a second when I see that I like a guy but then i feel depressed because there is no point of me liking somebody because he won't ever like me, and the next minute I start thinking """"""""besides, you're not even sure you like him, because maybe you're lesbian"""""""".
Every day I wake up with a lot of anxiety and I feel like there is no point of going outside. At first it helped to think that gay people are ok with being gay, that they're proud of the way they are ( I have a pen-friend who's gay and he told me that he's always known that he was gay, and that he liked being gay, I was shocked when reading that because I've always thought taht people who were gay shouldn't let everyone know , or that they should be ashamed, I don't know.. even when my sister told us and then she was ok with everyone knowing it I was like """"""""how can she be ok with that??"""""""" and it was kind of weird,) but now after reading that, I am not sure anymore that gay people enjoy having those thoughts, and sometimes I'm not even sure I DON'T enjoy those thoughts, I think this is the point of hocd ,not knowing anything for sure!! My aunt gave me a very nice night dress for christmas, its very warm and soft and I love it, but it's dark blue and grey, and eventhough it's clearly for girls I was afraid of wearing it because it made me feel masculine and therefore unconfortable, I didn't wear it till last week and I wanted to return it, but then I thought that by doing it it would mean that I was running away from my problems and that made me spike thinking that I was running away from the fact that I am gay because I wear a blue pijama, so that's how far my hocd has come. I can't even wear a stupid pijama!!
I am still new here and I haven't posted much but I don't see a lot of people with HOCD ,and it isn't really helping..
please someone share his/her own experience here.. I need help!!

"alright so i met my therapist and the session went well.however later that i just had a random image of two men doing it and im not exactly sure what i felt but it felt nice for a second.BAM there it was back.i started analyzing the reaction and started getting more and more paranoid.i started asking myself all kinds of questions...did i like it? stuff like that basically.then i saw some gay porn to see if i liked it i felt really weird watching it.i started to get all paranoid.
ive been straight all my life and now im afraid that i dont like girls anymore.i know it seems irrational but the fear is very real.
it might be that my mind might be playing tricks on my by mixing up pleasurable images.
i try to tell myself whats the big deal if you turn gay you would probably enjoy it but no...dosent seem to work...the anxiety seems to be there.
please help me control this spike before it escalates and i get all depressed..
im primarily afraid of my reaction to the thoughts...

"Alright so I don't mean to discriminate against the LGBTQ community in any way. I am just very, very scared and need some help.
I am 16 years old and have been comfortably straight my entire life. I've also had OCD my entire life, though it was centered around other things. I was actually quite the pervert when it came to men and I was into man on man porn (still am). Women were something that never crossed my mind as anything but friends. Then, one of my friends began to talk about the concept of bisexuality. At first, I was supportive and cool with it. However, after she came out that she was bisexual, I was shocked and terrified. I had trusted her - she had displayed an interest in men since the day I met her. For a time, I tried my best to support her despite my concern, often asking her questions about what it was like. But throughout this time, I began to develop a sort of hyper-awareness. I noticed that many women hugged each other and got very close to one another. As someone who is rather conservative and doesn't like being touched, I found this alarming. Perhaps I should be doing all that? No, that is gay. Or maybe it's not and I'm gay for not doing it? Those thoughts didn't matter much to me but that did cause some concern.
Then came my friend's last day at school. On that day, the thought that kicked off my OCD wriggled it's way into my head: 'Let's kiss her. She's bi.' I was horrified I had even thought of such a thing, but my mind kept going and entertained it, imagined it. I had never imagined kissing a girl before and I was disgusted by it. From that point onwards, I fell down a spiralling tunnel of Pure O OCD that I could not escape. I remember screaming at myself in the mirror, crying, telling myself to remember who we are.
I didn't want to be gay but I felt like I was becoming gay. That before I knew it I would fall in love with a woman and have sex with her.
Those thoughts took over everything, despite my best efforts to block them out by thinking of straight things I did in the past. I questioned everything. Those thoughts melded into my head and stayed there. Throughout the six weeks of the Christmas holidays, I worried, endlessly, in a haze of confusion and loathing. I went back to school, met a girl who had similar interests to me and did nice drawings, got a false crush on her - something I had feared the most. I still have a false crush on her and the fact that she may be gay herself isn't helping. I realise every day that we could be together. And I tell myself I'll love it and if the opportunity arises, we should do it.
But I don't want to. Or at least, I don't think I want to.
I started testing myself more, looking at women and men to compare. I got groinal sensations with women, turned on by men. Though at the time, I couldn't distinguish from them. I began to look at porn, of guys jerking themselves off and masturbated for the first time. It became a habit. I felt like I had to get off on every sexual thought for men or it would just disappear and be replaced with women again.
I have stopped testing myself now. There is no point since I know I will experience false attraction and feelings of fake love and want. I don't want women, not truly. I have never even thought of them like that once - the concept itself had never even crossed my mind. But now, the gay thoughts are all that there are and they are who I am now. I don't want to be like this. I am not spiking while writing this. I experience anxiety when looking at pretty women and I've had many false crushes that feel so damn real. It all feels so real. I get stressed out in a different way seeing men and straight couples now. I feel like there is no such thing as straight anymore, that everyone is gay and so I must be too. I see stats all the time that say 80% of people are bi. I just want to be straight but while I type this, my OCD tells me I don't. It's constantly telling me that being gay is right. It's a feeling, a very subtle feeling. But if I address it and attempt to validate it and support it, I spike.
I need help.
Am I gay? Am I in denial?
Or am I straight and have HOCD?
Don't tell me to go and see OCD specialists - I can only do this on my own. My dad is the only one who knows about my problem and he refuses to get me any sort of clinical help. I need to do this all on my own. But I fear this isn't OCD and I am so damn tired of this feeling that's telling me I'm gay and forcing me to enjoy seeing naked women and what not. I do not truly enjoy it, the OCD does.
I am ranting. I am sorry. Just, help, please. I've beaten myself before to try and stop the thoughts, that niggling feeling. But it doesn't go away not matter how much the bruises hurt.","['shock', 'disgust', 'fall', 'confusion', 'confusion', 'writing', 'anxiety', 'anxiety', 'bruise', 'interest', 'fear', 'joy', 'OCD', 'Thought']","['spike', 'sensation']","['anxiety', 'shock', 'bruise', 'interest', 'disgust', 'writing', 'confusion', 'fall', 'fear', 'joy', 'Thought', 'spike', 'sensation', 'OCD']",1.0,,,,
"I haven't posted here in ages.  My anxiety for this theme is way down but the symptoms are evolving.  I see beautiful women but don't feel any sexual attraction. Stuff that used to turn me on isn't anymore.  And everytime I see a topless male is gives me groinal responses. This can be watching tv, facebook, etc..  I am not looking for these images rather I am just going about my daily life and they appear now and then.  But everytime I get a groinal response. 
About 5 months ago I posted about this on OCD Action forum.  There is a poster there called Orwell 1984 and she/he said I am gay and need to get over it.   I have had this 12 yrs now and although I don't get crippling anxiety anymore I feel like my situation is worse. My sexual reactions to women is dwindling all the time and it seems like the groinals are turning into sexual desire (WHICH I ABSOLUTELY DO NOT WANT!).
I notice there is very few hocd topics on this forum and wonder if its not taken seriously as an ocd theme.
Lately my anxiety has been fixated on health and people around me getting cancer etc..
I go out the weekends but dont feel any drive to chat up girls. 
Someone posted up about the finger ratio on a ocd forum in 2008 and I have never gotten over the fact I have female ''gay'' ratio.  Studies continue being done on this and they are saying lesbians have short index fingers and so there is something in it.

"Throughout my life, i was always into girls. I mean i was such a perv in Middle, HS and my freshman year (spring/summer were my fav seasons bikinis and shorts FTW) but something that i thought turn my whole world upside down. I was driving with my little adopted bro and for some reason i pictured kissing him ( i know i am a sick ******* for it) not only was i depressed and disgusted with myself but i kinda made a connection. You see i never had a girl friend in my life, and it took me until the age of 20 to land my first kiss with a babe (im kinda of a social fucktard with low self esteem) so when i thought of that disturbing image i was like """"""""it makes sense im gay"""""""" i was in shock for an entire month and looked for answers online because every thought i had doubted my sexuality and discovered i have HOCD. I was having anxiety and panic attacks off the roof, then Fall semester came, and i made it a goal to be more appealing and social on campus, in a way it worked i landed my first kiss and had a girlfriend in a dating way. The future looked bright cause me and the chick got together in my room and she gave me a handjob and i loved it, could not cum though since this was a new experience for me. My happiness was at an all time high, and i thought this phase was coming to an end. I was dead wrong....
So Spring semester came on by and things took a turn for the worse, for starters the chick and me went separate ways (broke my heart, thats a good sign right? And in a way i still want her, maybe im just crazy) and on my 21st bday i was taken to a strip club which i enjoyed and then the most embarrassing moment in my life happened, i got a hooker in attempt to have sex and could not get it up (though when i got to my house all i could think about was her and jerked off like crazy), and my HOCD spiked bigger than before and i was convinced i was a homo. Summer came by and i am talking to a new girl (awesome babe) and once again it was a love hate day, she left for philly for a month and i kinda did not want her anymore (guess cause i was not seeing and felt it was long distance) but she came back and we got together on the 4th of July and she gave me a hug, it was the best hug ever cause without the use of masturbating i got an erection and i was like """"""""**** yeah, take that HOCD!!!"""""""" but then something happened to us and under stress my HOCD gets out of control (no matter what the situation) but we got through it and everything went ok except she was still stressed form the event we went through.
Now i have been struggling with this for a year now, maybe a little more than a year, and i have good and bad news for myself. Bad news is that with the thoughts i am now indifferent and accepting from time to time, is that bad? It freaks me out because in a way its like saying """"""""**** it, i give up i guess im gay!!!"""""""" and what freaks me out even more is im different and accepting to such a possibility that i get depressed and shut myself out. The good news is that look back the past year and i dont see a gay man in myself hell i dont even see a guy with HOCD, because i see and remember all the women i found attractive, but i barely remember any of the thoughts i had that were homo.
I need some closure and i need some feedback, what the hell is wrong with me because now im doing things lie going up to a mirror and saying things like """"""""im gay"""""""" in order to burnout the doubts in my mind and at first i freak out but now im accepting and indifferent to the words i say to myself, and then i get hit with another spike... and now its one of those days were the feelings and thoughts feel so real....

"I'm 17 and a girl.

This has been on and off since I was around 14. I go through these periods of questioning except this one has lasted since around August. I will look at both genders and ask myself if I am attracted to them. I will watch porn to see what one I get more attracted to. I just obsess over it but it feels like I'm trying to prove to myself that I am a lesbian.

I wanted to be a boy when I was younger and I think thoughts have stayed. I excessively daydream about being a boy. I dress like one when I'm alone and create a story for him. Most of the time he is gay but sometimes he is straight. I heard this is called Malidaptive daydreaming.

I just can't help but think that my attraction for guys is just carried on from when I was younger and saw a boy and wanted to be him. I don't like get turned on by the whole thing or anything and don't tell many people about it. I guess my male character is the perfect guy. But yeah I find guys hot and I guess I'm attracted to them but I don't want to date one or anything like that. With girls it's like I know when they are pretty. But I don't know if it's my head that tells me this or not but I want to date a girl and kiss one etc.

Lastly, I have other OCD type things I do and one revolves around looking like a man and another is with cancer. I was bullied up until around the age of 15 for looking like a boy and so became a girly girl. I keep wondering what I would be like if I wasn't bullied. The thing with the man thing is that it does give me anxiety although not too much but I try and skip over the letter M and the thoughts pop into my head at random times making me repeat actions. But this lesbian/bi thing doesn't give me anxiety. It may be that I'm just an open minded person but I wouldn't care what my orientation is I just want to know it already. I also don't know if I don't want to date guys just because I have no self confidence or self esteem.I also think that seeing guys triggers the whole looking like a man thing but so does being around people in general (besides family/friends). But I posted a similar question and someone told me that this isn't homosexuality and I was sad and I don't know why.

"Hi all,
I have been looking online at some forums and help pages and think this may be my problem, but need some clarification really...
Well, I will get to my story now…I have been having these thoughts since I was about 18 years old (I am 24 now!) that I might be gay. When I was younger and at school, I always had crushes on girls and I have been in a few relationships with girls too. I am even in a relationship with a girl now and I have been for the past 4 years.
These thoughts originated back when I was with my previous girlfriend. I was with her about a year at the time and then the thoughts started I cant remember what caused them, they were very overwhelming and to the stage where I couldn’t handle it anymore! I managed to tell my girlfriend at the time and she was very understandable and slowly over time I managed to control things a bit better.
Its like a constant battle in my head, one side saying “am I gay” or “yes I am gay” and the other saying “no, I wouldn’t let myself be gay” and I don’t like the thought of it!
Me and this girlfriend split up and I had a few one night stands up until my next relationship, these were with girls also.
I then met my new girlfriend and things were still calm but every now and again these thoughts creep back into my head. Sometimes they grip hold of me tight enough that I feel extremely down. I sometimes sit or lay down in a certain way and then think to myself, “that position seems a bit gay” so I move or change how I am led/sat.
I avoid watching some programs/films on TV just incase there is something that triggers my thoughts off again and I spiral into sadness.
I know that it is also something to do with anxiety and sometimes if I see someone on TV my heart starts to beat and I start to think again and that causes another spike.
I have loads of male friends and I don’t find any of them attractive whatsoever. I do notice that some guys are obviously more attractive than others, but I don’t feel attracted to them myself. I even know a few gay guys and I don’t feel attracted to these either.
But, as soon as I see something or hear something relating to it, I always tend to start thinking “am I gay?!” again and then I either spiral out of control or I manage to ignore it the best I can.
If I masturbate, its always over heterosexual porn or lesbian porn. I have tried looking at gay porn to test myself but it made me feel anxious and uncomfortable.
Even when I am writing this, my mind is telling itself that I am being untruthful and that I am gay, but something inside of me just doesn’t believe it, very deep down!
Can anyone help? Am I suffering from HOCD or am I in denial?! I just want to be happy again, with no worry.
Sorry for the essay!

"As the title says; does anyone else suffer from that?
I suffer from pure O with my relationship with my husband as the main theme.
But all my life, I have expierienced extreme homesickness.
All from my first school trip until now, I have suffered more or less.
Looking back, Inhave had some great camps and trips (I was a girl scout too), the good things are the ones I remember best, but I have always missed my parents more than most other children.
In my teens it was a little bit better, I dont remember being to upset, but as a grown up, it has actually become worse.
It is always in the time up to a trip (and it can be one night with work), that I reallyz suffer.
I am worried but I really dont know what I am worried about. Of missing, I guess, but other than that I really cant explain it.
I am not the really adventoures type, so it has not been a big problem to """"""""avoid"""""""" going away for longer times, and my husbands job does not contend travelling either (I also suffer if he is away, and especially before he goes)
Next week I am going to Berlin for to nights with my mom. When we booked the trip a couple of months ago, I didnt think it would be a problem. After all, it is my mom, who knows me so well, and at the time I was relatively OCD free, and I also thought it would be a good kind of exposure. I have been looking very much forward to it, and made plans.
And then then a lot of things happened. Nothing to do with the trip, but I am in a bad state - I am on sick leave due to stress at work, and my OCD has returned with a vengeance.
Of course, now I am SO worried about this trip, and how it will go and how I will cope, and I dont want my mum to have a bad trip either.
I dont know, if it is a good idea to go with the state I am in.
What I mean is, I knowmit would be some kind of exposure to go, which is good, but would it be too stressful, when I also suffer from stress, with all that follows of physical and psychological. What I have been advised to do about the stess is of course to relax and only do things, that I want to, and that arent stressful.
I guess that might be easier for a non OCD sufferer, but sometimes finding out, what you want to, and also without hurting others, can generate a lot of doubt and stress.
Well, this became a novel again...
What I want to ask you is; does anyone else suffer from homesickness, and do you think it is a part of the OCD? How have you been working with it?
And what would you advise me to do in this specific situation?

I think there are many reasons for this, particularly the careless way that many colleagues handled chemicals (I was the youngest, some colleagues started in labs with mouth-pipetting...). In addition to this, I have always excelled academically and was top of my year at university - however this now feels like a curse, as I understand how this chemical works and so am very aware of it (in no way do I wish to sound arrogant there). I understand the saying ignorance is bliss. I was also informed that there was no acceptable level of contamination with this chemical, and this has stuck in my head. As a result of my fear of the lab and of this particular chemical, I have lost pretty much everything. I started a PhD in October but had to give this up as my fear was ruining my life and my fiance's life (excessive handwashing/showering/keeping clothes separate etc). I honestly do not want to work in a lab again, so have given up my entire career plan with no idea what to do next, especially as I need to earn money in a way that won't set off my OCD anxiety. As a consequence of giving up my career, I have used up all my savings (not helped by the large sum that I had to repay the university for choosing to leave my course early) and am pretty much broke. After leaving the lab, I have tried to rid my house of traces of this chemical. The truth is I'm scared of my house and everything in it, as I believe it has most likely been contaminated with this chemical. Outside of the house I am fine, but inside I am probably a strong case (not even wanting to touch light switches or door handles etc.)
I have accepted that I have OCD and have visited my gp several times for help and treatment. I've tried everything I can - I got the self-help books my doctor listed (as they are so general to accommodate all variations of OCD I don't really find them that helpful). I have been referred for therapy and am waiting on the local team to contact me. After hearing nothing from them for months, I have been back to my doctor to chase this up (and she was surprised that I hadn't been contacted for an assessment, and so is chasing it up). I took the anti-depressants my doctor recommended I try, despite my reluctance as I know that they cannot solve the root of this. I have done everything I can to try and beat this, and to show the people around me that I am making the effort and trying everything thrown at me. Yet despite all this, my fiance last week decided he didn't want to be with me anymore. I am of course devastated to lose him, and have also lost our home (he owned the house before we got together and so, as he decided we couldn't live together anymore, I've had to leave and am back in my childhood bedroom). I don't know what else I could have done. My gp wanted me to try the anti-depressants as she couldn't understand why I felt so guilty for being ill - yet when the one person you love more than anything tells you that it's made him a shell of himself and has taken away his entire life, I am of course going to feel guilty. He does say he knows that I haven't done this intentionally, but I will of course still feel guilty when he tells me how it has ruined his life, especially as I acknowledge that he put up with my restrictions and demands for several months. I have apologised to him, tried to show him that I'm making the effort, given up the PhD and career that was causing so much anxiety, and still it is not enough. I have read a lot of the posts on here from partners of OCD sufferers and I totally understand that it is a nightmare to live with, and have told my fiance that I understand his difficulties, but unlike these posts I accept my OCD diagnosis and am not only willing to accept help, but actively seeking it. I have also encouraged him to understand this condition using this website and others, and explained how he could read stories from other partners and even contact them, but he does not feel comfortable about this. It is obviously affecting his well-being, but he also refuses to talk to the same doctor as me (well a doctor in general) about the effect it is having on him, and I understand his reluctance to talk to a doctor, but what else can I do? (if he does read this, I am simply asking for advice from people that understand). I wish he could separate me from this condition, which I hope will not be with me forever.
I am therefore in need of some hope, some inspirational stories and some support from someone who understands. I have lost my career and feel I can no longer use my degree, I have no money and now have lost my fiance and my home. Please give me some hope.","['outside', 'Treatment', 'surprise', 'bedroom', 'fear', 'anxiety', 'anxiety', 'guilt', 'hope', 'OCD', 'site']",['excessive'],"['outside', 'surprise', 'anxiety', 'OCD', 'site', 'bedroom', 'Treatment', 'fear', 'excessive', 'hope', 'guilt']",,1.0,,,

"I have never posted before, but I just wanted to share my recent experiences. They may provide hope to some.
I was diagnosed with OCD about 4 months ago. I now realise that some serious-ish mental problems I have had for 20 years or so (I am 43) were OCD-related, contamination theme. Looking back, I was always a bit of a 'checker' too, but nothing too serious. I always put that down to my Mum who was/is a bit of a checker herself. I had been on and off sertraline 50g since the mid-1990s as I was assumed to be suffering from depression.
My real problems though started about 6 months ago. I took on a very difficult role at work about a year ago and (because i'm an idiot) started working about 75 hours a week under pressure. At the time I blanked everything out, but, looking back, 3-4 months or so into the role I was starting to check things much more. I also started to fear jumping in front of trains (I commute by train) and causing harm with knives. Eventually my sleep started to be affected and I started to have wild fears about my job. Then the fears started getting repetitive and very quickly I started to sleep no more than 2-3 hours a day (never in one go), even when I took sleeping pills. The lack of sleep made the thoughts worse, etc. By this time my wife had stepped in and had me signed off work. I was off for 4 months, returning recently. I had also been ignoring some symptoms for a while, for which cancer was one possible explanation. An NHS advert on the radio triggered this as my main worry for a while. The exact sequence in all the above is not quite right as I have summarised, but hopefully you get the picture.
I went to see my GP and she put me back on sertraline 50g, again assumed depression. It didn't feel the right diagnosis, but, desperate, I went along with it. At least something was being done. As I was going back on sertraline I looked it up on the net and found that it was also used for OCD. Like most people, sadly, I had at that time a stereotyped and trivialised view of what OCD is and couldn't see why it would be used for both OCD and depression. I thought I would google OCD, just out of interest. When I did I found I was looking at a description (on this site actually) that could have been written for me. I went back to the GP, told her the whole picture this time (something I couldn't bring myself to do when I saw her before) and she referred me to a psychiatrist.
To cut a long story short, I was moved up to 100g and then 150g of sertaline. I have also done, so far, a bunch of weekly sessions of CBT. I have also been seeing an accupuncturist, which really helped, especially before the increased drugs kicked in. I have also been studying mindfulness and zen-type stuff, again which has helped. My wife has been amazing.
Things have got much better. My sleep is more or less normal now, the repetitive thoughts have receded (although the thoughts are still there and I get little reactions from triggers from time to time), I am checking less and have really worked on the fears behind the checking. I am now back at work and doing OK, not 100% by any means but OK. I am actually enjoying life most of the time, whereas last autumn part of me was hoping I did have cancer - a way out of the misery. I did have side-effects from the drugs (felt a bit weird, sexual issues) but my body has adjusted pretty well.
I appreciate that I have only had OCD-lite, but still hope that my experience provides some hope to fellow-sufferers.","['symptom', 'interest', 'site', 'joy', 'role', 'checking', 'depression', 'hope', 'fear', 'Thought', 'OCD']",['theme'],"['role', 'OCD', 'site', 'depression', 'interest', 'fear', 'checking', 'joy', 'Thought', 'symptom', 'theme', 'hope']",1.0,,,,
"I've been suffering from Pure-O for many years. Whenever I am OCD-controlled, I can not concentrate on anything, not even while I’m writing. Whenever those OCD thoughts occupy my brain, I must stop whatever I am doing and sort out those thoughts. All my time is wasted. Everyone has 24 hours per day. But I feel that I have only 10. (On average, I spend 14 hours per day sorting out OCD thoughts.) Minus my sleep time (6—7 hours), how many hours are there left? Actually, even when I seem to be able to focus, I have to stop whatever I'm doing once in a while to sort out the thoughts. While writing this post, I've had three OCD-rumination intervals by far. At my most severe points these months, I can’t even think clearly. At my most panic and anxious moments, I totally lose the ability to express myself. I can’t find the correct words while writing. If I decide to write a thing, then an OCD thought comes, I have to deal with the thought for hours and end up forgetting what I was going to write. What frustrates me above all is that OCD makes me even unable to read! (And I LOVE reading!) I hardly can concentrate while reading books. The anxiety is killing me. I feel I'm a slave to it and that I can never break the fetter. It’s like an inner imprisonment. I can’t breathe. I’m unable to do the things I so dearly love. I can never do well on exams. 50% of the test time I am occupied with OCD thoughts and unable concentrate. My test results never show my real talent. People all think that I am really as retarded as my test scores show. And this is not true at all! Wasn’t I OCD-controlled during the test, I could have score two times higher. In fact, by nature, I learn things faster than most people. Yet my OCD slows everything down. I can’t focus while studying. To have great intelligence yet unable to use it is worse than to have no intelligence at all. My self-esteem has sunk into the lowest degree. I always daydream what a successful and wonderful woman I would become if I didn’t have OCD. Whenever I compare this ideal self with my real self, an unutterable self-antipathy overwhelms me. I feel I have no future. I love literature and art, and aspire to be an expert in either area. But this is ridiculous because my OCD has ruined all my talents. I'll be no author or artist, but a loser who does nothing except sorting out her OCD thoughts.","['anxiety', 'anxiety', 'writing', 'Thought', 'OCD']",['rumination'],"['rumination', 'anxiety', 'writing', 'Thought', 'OCD']",1.0,,,,
"Triggers: period, health anxiety
Feeling really anxious right now...so basically I have definite health anxieties and I worry about getting pregnant a lot. So my period came on time as usual but it’s kinda light for me as mine are pretty bad. Before anyone asks I take precautions etc, don’t think I am pregnant it just gets into my head (OCD style ruminations). But I’ve been super stressed lately as I’m unemployed and job hunting and i suffer from anxiety anyway and last week I got so stressed I like blacked out and fell to the floor for a couple of seconds.
Anyway getting to the point...I went to the docs today as my hearing has been off in one ear, she checked it and said there’s some discharge deep inside (I don’t know what this even means?) and she’s given me some ear drops. Cut to now, I have sinus pain and feel quite nauseous, so worried that A) something’s majorly wrong with me and I’m going to die on my sleep or B ) I’m pregnant which I know I’m not as my period is definitely getting heavier.

"Hi Everyone - i wanted to post what happened to me today to see if it was just me overreacting or if anyone else had experienced something like this.
OK well went to the dr today to talk about a coulple of general health problems today, but decided to pluck up the courage to mention that i thought maybe i had pure o, and to discuss how to go about getting help and a diagnosis - it took soo much for me to say anything cos ive been been worried abou the implications of a diagnosis regardin possible furutre jpbs in psychology, and also just basically havin to deal with my thoughts. So i mentioned pure o - he didnt even seem to know what it was - he was really off and seemed to find the whole thing amusing , and i had to seem to try and convinmce him that i was having problems, and he asked me to give him examples of the thoughts i was havin - whihc some of them i have nevber told anyone so that made me feel really vulnerable.
When i did tell him, he seemed almost bemused, and started banging on about freud and his theory that everyone is anxious and most people swith lights on and off. OK firstly, i think i have pure o, so i dont do compulsive behaviours, and secondly, as i said to him, i know a bit about freud and think he's generally a nut and i didnt really think that his psycho analytic theories were a definite thing to accept. He then proceeded to say he thinks im just anxious in general - complete rubbish i have gone out and done so mnay things for myself that require confidence etc - i can cope with other stuff in life just fine, its just these thoughts that get me down. I told him that whilst i appreciate that some of the symptoms of ocd are common to the wider population,only 2% have ocd.
Anway he then said he didnt really have time to talk to me about this today and i should make another appointment to discuss it - which i thought was lovely of him considerin i had shared stuff with him i had never told anyone and i was asking for help. I then said how do i go about gettin a diagnosis - he said through him. I said, well isnt a psychiatrist supposed to be involved and he was like - no i can diagnose you - which i find laughable considering his general attitude and the fact he seemed to have no knowledge of pure o. Anyway i left thr drs in a flood of tears feeling angry, vulnerable and defeated.
Anyway, i just wanted to know - is the general procedure for goin about gettin a diagnosis for ocd - i mean should we feel like we habe to fight to get diagnosed and to be taken seriouslly? I can understand from the perspective that people do read stuff and self diagnose, but thats really not the case with me, ive had this problem for as long as i can remember and everything that people say on this website makes perfect sense to me.
I dont know what to do now - plus ive started obsessin that he's goin to write down the thoughts ive had on my medical records and people will read it and think badly of me

"I have several guilt ruminations relating to the way i treated my now deceased dog. She died at the age of
17 and a half years old, when i had just turned 24. I grew up with her as a part of my life, I loved her so much but me and my family should not have had a dog. We were neglectful, she was fed well and stroked but she didnt have many walks and i think i tormented her and played with her only when it suited me. She was smacked for barking and doing other things we saw as naughty. She did not have much mental stimulation and this got worse during the last 3 to 4 years of her life. We had moved house by this time, before she had a poor view of people going by the house, so that provided a bit of little stimulation, but she did not have this when we moved. So she had nothing to do. Around this time she started to nibble her front paws. I dont think she hurt herself or caused damage but i read dogs do this from boredom. It hurts that this was all she had to do for years. This is no life. I hate myself.","['guilt', 'stroke']",['rumination'],"['rumination', 'stroke', 'guilt']",1.0,,,,
"Hi Guys,
Sorry its me asking about hospital again, but I am really confused and could really do with some advice or knowledge from people who actually understand OCD and how it feels to have it.
I have been suffering from OCD now for over 6 years and it has progressively got worse and worse. In short my life is completely disabled by the disorder and fear of contamination. There is very little I can now do in my life, although I have somehow managed throughout the whole thing to hold down my job.....which is somewhat of a miracle considering I struggle to even touch or move much in my own home. I cant even make a cup of tea, turn the tv over, sit on a random chair, touch a pen, move my hair out of my face or use the toilet without a whole drama and continuous rituals being involved.
I have tried various treatment and have been on medication but nothing has worked. I have had private therapy in the form of CBT. Group CBT on the NHS, pyshotherapy with a pyschologist, seen various GPs etc.
During those 6 years I have also had alot of low self worth and issues with my appearance and have gradually lost alot of weight. This has recently got worse and my eating has now become an issue in itself. I have been told I have an eating disorder and my health is at risk. I am not sure if I am anorexic - part of me keeps thinking its not that serious - but I dont know whether that part is the denial in me. My BMI is very low and I have physical symptoms to suggest I am.
My GP and pyschologist have now suggested that I go into a pyschiatric ward of a hospital. I want to get better and if that is what it takes then part of me wants to go, however there is a huge part of me that doesnt think it will help and I am very scared in case it makes me worse. I have been to look at the ward and because it is new it is very nice and each room has an en suite and it is an all female ward. But when I asked about the treatment the pyschiatrist and ward nurse were very evasive - there is no OCD or ED specialist there, and they are very easy going with regards to the days structure. So I can come and go as I please and they said they encourage you to take in activities that you enjoy doing to do during the day.
What I am very confused about, is how this is really going to help me or benefit me? Apart from taking me out of my usual day to day routine and away from my usual structured day at work / home I dont see that they will really be offering me anything. They said the nurses are always on hand to talk if needed - but are they going to understand the OCD? I feel that I really need someone who is an expert because it is so severe and ingrained in me. But the psychiatrist said I had already seen the experts at group CBT and that had not helped. But that was for 1 hour a week with 12 other people. Surely they have more specialists for people with severe ocd who need inpatient treatment?
I asked my doctor about the Maudsley but she didnt seem to have much info and said that it is an older hospital and the facilities are no where near as good or nice. But when I looked online it seems to me that they have the specialist unit for severe OCD in a house setting with other sufferers? Does anyone know anything about this?
Has anyone been through the same kind of experiance as me with hospitalisation? Does anyone know more about referals to the Maudsley or speciailst units? Also does anyone else suffer with an eating disorder aswell as OCD as this seems to be confusing things even more. I am sure some hospitals cater for one of the other but not both of them together. Which do I get help for first?
Im sorry if this is a rather rambled post...I am finding it really hard to concentrate and think straight but know i need to try to make a decision soon as I need to let the ward know if they are to put me on the waiting list - which is only short at the moment.
Thanks tp all who have read my post!","['fear', 'toilet', 'Rituals', 'Medication', 'symptom', 'joy', 'OCD', 'Treatment']",[],"['Treatment', 'fear', 'Rituals', 'toilet', 'joy', 'symptom', 'Medication', 'OCD']",,1.0,,,

  Tuesday said:
We've had the House of Obsessive Compulsives and now the House of Agoraphobics. What next - the House of Chocoholics, where sufferers are taught to turn their backs on a whole pile of Curly Wurlies? All flippancies aside, though, this is serious look at a debilitating condition. Unfortunately, for those who don't suffer from agoraphobia, it's hard to understand, and at times it's difficult not to feel you want to shake all three of the participants until their teeth rattle. But that's unkind, because the lives of Archana, Su and Simon, the three inhabitants of the house, are circumscribed by their fear of panicking in public. Here Professor Paul Salkovskis sets them a series of tests aimed at getting them to overcome their irrational fears. Of course, it's a tough, often tearful road. And, particularly for Archana, it looks as if it's going to be a long, long haul. Concludes tomorrow.

It's obvious his patience is at breaking point. As, it sometimes seems, is Paul's. From the back seat he tells the wailing Archana, """"""""If you're not going to listen, we will stop speaking to you. This is baby stuff.""""""""

What is Agrophobia (Source: National Phobics)
  Quote
Agoraphobia is a very complex phobia usually manifesting itself as a collection of inter-linked phobias.
For example many agoraphobics also fear being left alone (monophobia), dislike being in any situation where they feel trapped (exhibiting claustrophobia type tendencies) and fear travelling away from their 'safe' place, usually the home. Some agoraphobics find they can travel more easily if they have a trusted friend or family member accompanying them, however this can quickly lead to dependency on their carer.
The severity of agoraphobia varies enormously between sufferers from those who are housebound, even room-bound, to those who can travel specific distances within a defined boundary.","['hope', 'fear']","['theme', 'irrational', 'obsessive']","['obsessive', 'fear', 'irrational', 'theme', 'hope']",1.0,,,,
"OK so, to all intents and purposes, I have coped well with OCD and depression – at least on the surface: I have never taken time off work and managed to hide my problems from anybody who I didn’t want to tell. I consider myself lucky in this respect, but nonetheless I've struggled. I’ve had ruminations which have made my pull out handfuls of hair and rush to the toilets hyperventilating and/or crying. They ranged from ‘what if deep down I’m evil?’ to ruminations about if I was living my life in the right way, or constantly causing harm without realising it, to a fear I was letting down my family to the constant question: ‘why don’t other people worry about these things? Does this mean I am mad?’ When alone in the office I was terrified that I would lose control and throw myself off the balcony or stab myself; I was frightened to open my mouth in meetings for fear of saying something inappropriate or insulting; after dating somebody in the workplace I was really afraid of running into him and had so many ruminations about what had happened/whose fault it was/what did I do wrong/did I overreact to something, etc.) I’d have one of these fears/ruminations for weeks at a time and then a new one would start. The train to work was a nightmare for reasons I can’t be bothered to list... Alongside all this, I had the usual paralysing fear after every mistake I made that it would lead to me losing my job. I was punishing myself for mistakes by hurting myself on purpose and starving myself; felt the need to read and re-read emails I’d sent; re-write post it notes and check everything was unplugged before I left in case there was a fire and an elderly lady I work with was trapped! I was constantly late because of my train fears. I was (and still feel I am sometimes) a mess.
In spite of all this, nobody seemed to notice and kept saying how good I was at my job! People would say, ‘how are you?’ and I’d think, ‘I want to kill myself. Can’t you see I’m crazy and in despair?’ but they didn’t.
I did get help, sort of. After my initial diagnosis, I’d been seeing somebody privately in the evenings because I couldn’t wait any longer and didn’t want to take time off work (ironically; anyway I wasn’t much better at home sometimes but the godsend that is E4, having loved ones around me and a love of cooking and running helped). But I stopped the private therapy as I couldn’t really afford it (ended up in debt) and anyway my therapist left! I admit I found the tasks so hard and didn’t work hard enough at the time. Recently I had another referral from my GP for an assessment for NHS therapy. I called them today and tried to explain how I really cannot take time off work (I can’t; I don’t want to tell my colleagues and as I have a 1.5 hour commute from my home town to my workplace, it simply would not be possible.) The woman said I could only be seen 9 to 5, Monday to Friday. The woman was very rude and said she would cancel the referral and not to call again! (I was a bit rude to her, but I didn’t swear or anything. I just said ‘well that’s rubbish!’) Firstly, can she do that? Even though I was surprised I couldn’t see someone on a Saturday, but I do understand how the system must work and that I can’t expect it to fit my timetable! Secondly, I am determined not to take time off work and it seems sensible to get help before it gets to the point where I need time off. Is this impossible? Can I get help outside the hours of 9 to 5 without paying for it? (I will if I have to; I just need to save up money again!)
I admit this might be my silly pride, or related to my upbringing but I’m so terrified of being a failure and I can’t have time off work for therapy. Or does the fact that I’m still going in to work mean I don’t need help? That it’s not a problem; it really truly is ‘all in my head’ as it were?
I feel bad posting this; there are so many worse things happening to others. But any advice would be welcomed.

"Hey guys.

I have had all sorts of OCD themes, but one that always comes back is me being a bad person.

Lately i have been afraid to harm anything that lives or had lived. i have become completely vegan (partly... mostly due to my ocd???). and i am afraid i am stepping on bugs etc.

now more than a week ago i noticed there was a moth in our toilet room. it scared me a bit but i did not pay to much attention to it. i have only been home a couple of times in the last 1 - 2 weeks due to a divorce i am going trough right now. and every time i went into the toilet i noticed the moth. and i just did not give it any attention.

now last night when i  was home for some stuff. my wife mentioned the moth, i told her i already spotted it a week ago or so.

she asked me why i not already set it free at the time, and i just never really thought of that. so i went into the toilet put it in a glass and layed in on the floor outside, but it did not move. this morning it was still on the same spot, it must have died.

i now feel huge guilt because i may could have saved its life if i would have set it free earlier. i feel like a scumbag, and who i think i am that i can decide if something deserves to live or not?

I am comparing it to humans or loved ones. what if they were trapped, would i leave them there to die? no i don't think so. so why would the life of this moth be less important then theres?


It literately goes as far as to that my ocd tells me i am not worth of living on this planet because i am making decisions that kill other living beings.

people tell me i should not worry about these subject so much, because they think i am a great person with a really big hearth.

Serious i try to do my best and not hurt anyone or anything, but i just seem to fail every time again, i am so sick of myself.


ive been talking with my pdoc and they are going to send me to a place where they are specialised in OCD and other anxiety disorders.
they offer a therapy that is 4 days a week, and even offer that you can sleep there for those days. this would be a program of 12 weeks (4days a week).

i feel that i am gonna need this, because i really am at a low point, ive been getting therapy for my ocd for almost 2 years now, but i just feel that is is not enough.

i really hope they find me fitting into the program, because i still have to do a intake there, so its not yet determined that im going.

"Hi, I am relieved there is actually a forum of this kind out there, hopefully someone will be able to give me some advice on how my mum and I can help my brother. My brother is 30 and has suffered from OCD for all of his adult life. He has been hospitalised and is on a very high dose of medication. There have been some very low points in his life, and he has always seemed a little odd to those who don't know hime well. He has had one brief relationship with a girl who had a two year old. They remain best friends, I feel his strong bond with her son has a lot to do with this. He works with my husband and if he didn't I don't think he would cope with employment elsewhere. My mum called me today and said he has had a huge breakdown. He said to her that he thought of killing himself everyday and that no one knew the struggle is has everyday with his rituals and depression. He smokes pot, and has done so for a long time. He says this is hos only release even though he is aware that it is common knowledge it can only make his stuation worse. As his older sister I am beside myself with worry that he will do something stupid and I would really like to know what I can do to make a difference. any adice would be greatly appreciated","['hope', 'OCD', 'Medication', 'Thought', 'Rituals', 'depression']",[],"['OCD', 'depression', 'Thought', 'Rituals', 'Medication', 'hope']",,1.0,,,

"For almost the past year my OCD has really taken control and wow were there many, many annoying time consuming rituals to do everyday. About 2 weeks ago, it was at its worst. I simply couldn't get satisfied with an outcome of a ritual I was doing that was going nowhere and it took 3 hours. I was so mentally exhausted, extremely angry with myself I couldn't face it anymore. After that, I took a break and continued to face all my OCD fears I would normally face each day. It felt good cause I was so angry I just didn't care.
From that point on, I have pretty much stopped. Although occasionally OCD thoughts still popped into my head, but then I think I can't get back into doing this and I know once such a little ritual occurs, it feeds and feeds and I'm back at square one.
The thing is, it's still all in my head. Are these thoughts ever going to go away? This has been extremely hard work to keep facing my rituals but I feel so forced to just do the ritual.
Could such a ritual you simply cannot succeed become an open door to rid this monster? It seemed to have worked for me... so far. I don't know how long this will last though :dry:

"Son was up all last night doing rituals and zooming up and down stairs.I had very little sleep as anxious what would happen with sons appointment with psychologist.
My eldest son visited early morning to support me against his dad who seems to direct everything that happens at my feet.
When youngest son left.I asked husband if he would fix the squeeking door in sons room.Husband acted like a complete idiot and asked how to do this.I explained wd4o and put it in the hinges.OMG I lost the plot as he looked at me blankly whats wd40?I am honestly a very easy going person but I told him that i was leaving the room as had violent thoughts about kicking him hard and felt out of control.Husband is very intelligent guy with several degrees working on final year of third one so he aint silly.
I oiled door and eldest son changed all the wee guys bed and binned old duvet so he couldnt change it.SON ALSO WASHED DOWN THE POOL OF SPIT made by wee guy spitting in to bottles.Binned all bottles.I found where wee guy had stashed unused medication.
Phoned crisis unit where son had gone to meet cpn and psychologist and asked three times for message to be passed on.I ended up taking half of one of sons unused valium to calm me down.
The only person to call was social worker who has been giving me talk therapy.cpn asked her to call to see if I needed extra councilling session!!I explained situation and asked her to inform cpn and psychiatrist.
Wee guy came back and kicked off big time.But his older brother was very calm and controlled while I shook with fear.New bedding got fired down the stairs along with tirade of abuse about me being the mentally ill one not him.That he has made sure they know its me . :crybaby:
Im sure he has suceeded this time also.When my eldest son left my husband and him spoke together for ages.Upshot cpn realises that he is fine and that mum is unwell.She is stopping visits as son is very articulate and able to convince everyone that he has it all under control.That although psychologist did not turn up today .He has been appointed to a regular psychologist and care is now transferred to him.
I CANNOT SEE A WAY FORWARD .What does it say about me when he can hoodwink proffessional people and they believe that I am the one requiring treatment.

"A year ago, I was an anxious teen but I didn't have OCD and my life wasn't easy but right now it seems it was much easier than now. I'm desperate because I try to think that if it wasn't for this disorder, I would have finished high school already but now I'll be another year late to everything. Would I ever make it to college? I don't think so, I'm gonna drop dead soon. I can't handle this guilt and angst anymore, it's killing me in the inside, I can't bare with the fact that I've done things like:
-technically masturbate over members of my family including my little sister
-have had sexual thoughts about them including fantasies 
-checked out my little sister multiple times having thoughts about her bottom
-becoming a pedophile and an incest sick ******* 
-becoming a real pervert
You see? It's too much for someone to only be OCD, cause it's something else other than that. Yes I might ruminate, do rituals etc but I think it might be due to my anxiety disorder.

Dear Ocd,
Please leave my fellow sufferers alone. What gives you the right to act like our friend? Be a comfort, tell us to do these things to make the bad feelings go away and then turn it against us? Your like the best friend that turned against us. You told us rumination, checking, and reassuarnce is meant to make us feel better, so we do it and then we get caught in this trap. How can this be a good thing? We don't believe the people who we're meant to trust, and who tell us it's ok. We don't even trust ourselves anymore.
You make us feel so alone, disgusted, angry, frusrated, dirty and guilty. Why? Why would you do this to us? What have we done except for care? You plague us from the minute we wake up to the minute we go to sleep... You make us feel sick, we get knots in our stomach, we can't go out, we can't have relationships. Don't pretend to be our friend, please go.
We are not a match, and we don't want to spend anymore time with you. You might of been there when no one else was, but you torture us. I think it's time you go. We know life is short, and there is so much out there to experience, see and do, but we can't because of you. So many days, weeks, months have been wasted, and for what? We listen to you time and time again, but you don't losten to us. Don't you dare hurt these people anymore. They are good, true and caring.

"I don't even know at this point what I go to the Dr for or what on earth is going on in this brain of mine. 
I try to do my own research into it and get overwhelmed. I feel like I obsess over anything you could obsess about. 
From a young age I hated everything about myself and it just grew from picking at all my flaws to assuming everyone else can see them creating huge anxiety. I obsess over my weight even though I'm intelligent enough to know I'm not even the weight I should be, yet things like the nurse last week saying I was a perfect weight made me genuinely sad I wasn't being nagged about my weight as usual?! 
I skin pick without even knowing I'm doing it a lot of the time yet I know how awful it makes me feel after. I over think anything my husband does and create ridiculous scenarios that at my best I know he'd never do. 
Every stranger is turned into a threat in my head to the point I jump out my skin at the door knocking or someone walking too fast behind me. 
I feel like no doctor is going to take someone seriously that goes on and can't even pinpoint themselves what's going on. 
How am I genuinely such a great parent yet I can't fix myself?

"Hello,
I was just wondering because I have emetophobia (puke/puking phobia) and I have had a bug today (unless it's a food intolerance from the day before but I think it's a virus), which has given me a very painful stomach and nausea. I have really really struggled and it's made me feel like not carrying on with ERP (even though I have an assessment next month for in-patient hospital treatment).
Luckily I have a stash of anti-emetics and I've taken the maximum dose of domperidone but I think I would have thrown up without it (still very worried I'll be ill tonight, which is why I'm awake!).
How do you deal with sickness? (specifically tummy bug style sickness). How come normal people/you don't take excessive measures to try to avoid getting sick? any advice?
Thanks!

I think he thought i was being unco operative or beligerent because I pretty much said, that's an answer that could take forever. It's not like saying you have an ache in your knee or a headache.
He wanted me to list all the ruminations and thoughts- there are so many, and they change so often! It's not the same thing all the time. It's really specific things like touching things with my right side only and making things on my desk sit at right angles and it's a zillion thoughts running through my head.

"Hello,
I have several OCD 'themes'. One of them (and I know it sounds odd) is about responsibility for my Golden Retriever and constantly worrying that she will come to harm by eating something sharp or toxic. Because of this she only stays in two rooms in our house (the living room in the day and a bedroom at night; she does also get taken for walks and into the garden on a lead).
We have a gate blocking her from getting into the kitchen and a fireguard to block her from getting into the hallway/upstairs. Just now I was on Netflix in the living room and a member of my family walked through and left both gates open. I didn't notice so carried on watching a programme (for about 5-10 minutes). I suddenly noticed that I had not closed the gates and panicked- I am now unsure whether the reason that I suddenly noticed what had happened was because the dog was walking around the living room and if that's the case then maybe she went in the kitchen or I might have imagined the whole thing and she might have been lying down the whole time? I have absolutely no recollection because my attention was elsewhere.
My fear is that my dog got into the kitchen. That she then ate stuff from the floor (our kitchen/utility room area is messy with some socks strewn on the floor and moldy crumbs etc. plus other dropped items that I cannot pick up due to my contamination fears- I'm also particularly concerned there could be sterilizing tablets) and might now die because of it.
How do I deal with/manage/challenge this thought?
My plan so far is to attempt to distract myself and then just plan to be more careful next time. What would be a better way to deal with this?

It seems such a hard thing to fight all the time and it's hard to stay strong and ignore that little voice in my head that says to check it just one more time. Sometimes I can stay strong and ignore the voice and other times I give in. I suppose it is just going to take time. I've had 9 sessions with the therapist now.

"Hi all,
I don't post here regularly as sometimes I find it to be a trigger, but I do check around every once in a while.
I was diagnosed with OCD a few years ago, when I was in my teenage years. With the help of CBT and just understanding what was going on in my mind and breaking free of a manipulative relationship, I have gotten better (though not recovered fully) and been able to handle life. OCD generally revolves around my life, not my life around it.
However these 'spikes' do occur fairly often, mostly when I fear that my boyfriend is in potential 'danger' (which I find very embarrassing as why him? It's not normal to worry so much, it's weird). I can handle it most times, though it is very tiring and distracting when I'm trying to study for my degree.
I'm having a 'spike' right now, as my boyfriend flew to his home country yesterday to see his family for Christmas. Now I am so scared and performing my prayer rituals and other things more, since I fear the worst may happen to him wherever he goes.
I recall the therapist I saw in my adolescence telling me that location can't make a difference in potential dangers, and me being present with him can make no difference, and I can understand this but the more I think about it the more sense it makes to be worried ALL the time (as opposed to whenever I'm not directly speaking with him) and the more I think about this the more it seems that there's no way out of it and that I will become less able to cope. I realise that I am considerably more anxious when we're in different cities, and so I'm wondering that I will never incapable of ever holding a long-distance relationship (seeing as University creates so much uncertainty in life). I'm being exposed to my fears right now, but each time they're proven to be wrong I can only breath a sigh of relief for that one lucky instance - the same possibility of something horrible happening to him or anyone else will occur next time.
So what do I do if exposure cannot achieve anything? There's no way out!
I think I have made a similar-ish post before, I can't remember, so apologies if I have.

"Hello, the only way I think I have a shot at being free of my OCD is by getting over the core fear underlying the current theme. First some background. I have been on this form before quite a few times, but for those of you that don't know, my theme is quite unique. In my teenage years I got into parapsychology (research of psychic abilities) and became convinced it's real... Which is really really really bad if you have OCD. In fact it's probably the last thing you want to know.
But anyone I developed a fear of thinking about germs. I would terrify myself whenever I thought about germs teleporting/materialising to my hand or mouth. I would be convinced I was going to suffer a horrible end. Anyway years passed and nothing happened. The fear is still there but not as bad as it was. But within the past few years things have gone from bad to worse. I started to think that any altered state of mind is risk I can't take. I have developed a strong fear of not being able to sleep for an extended period (such as a week or two) which I fear will make  my thoughts about come true and me and my family will get horribly ill and die. 
I know this is very odd fear and I wish I could talk to someone else who has something like this, but I haven't met anyone like that yet. This fear seems silly, but it left me housebound for a year and a half (I'm over that now thank god). It has caused me so much suffering. I need to be free of it. But the only way I think I can is to expose myself to it. How the heck do I do that? I'd have to stay up for at least 3 days to make even a dent in it, which sounds really unpleasant and I don't even know whether it would work, but what else is there?","['OCD', 'Thought', 'fear']",['theme'],"['fear', 'Thought', 'theme', 'OCD']",1.0,,,,

For years now I have been having weird feelings and thoughts.
It started when I was in secondary school with locking doors. I would always check at least 10 times to make sure that i had. I also checked things like making sure the cooker was off. If I didn`t do this I would think that something would happen like a fire or what if..........................
This lasted for a few years and moved on to different things.

"As I've said before, I'm not sure how I can work on relationship OCD when I'm not in a relationship. But there is an OCD theme I can work on while I'm single, which is that I obsess and ruminate about finding a life partner.
For for last several years, whenever I had a spare moment, my mind would always go into problem-solving mode about how I can find a life partner. I ruminate about all the things I've read on the matter, including men's dating advice, feminism, culture, economics, gender studies, evolutionary psychology, and whole bunch more. I often go over how unfair it is that women prefer one kind of man over another, or how unfair it is that external circumstances (like economic factors) or internal factors (like my psychological problems) have led to my singleness. I come up with strategies to overcome these problems . I conceptualize, prioritize, analyze, synthesize, philosophize, strategize, test, check.....and I'm still single.
It's hard not to obsess about it because I feel like my life can't move forward any further until I find a partner. A generation of millennial self-help gurus would say that this attitude is exactly my problem, and they'd say that I need to focus on achieving personal fulfillment on my own by traveling the world, curing diseases, sending probes to Mars, working for social justice, blah blah blah. You know what? I don't care. I don't care anymore. What does traveling the world matter when I would come home to an empty apartment at the end of the journey? What does sending a probe to Mars matter when I sleep alone?
Yeah, I get it that I'm supposed to focus on personal achievement. I totally get it that I'm supposed to relish my independence and that I'm not supposed to worry about relationships, especially because I'm a man. I feel like the achievement thing didn't bring the deep satisfaction and profound personal fulfillment that it was supposed to. I have two bachelor's degrees, I'll have a PhD in physics, I've worked at NASA, and I'm surfer. And I don't care anymore. I don't care because when yet another woman stops returning my text messages or tells me that it's just not going to work out, and I lie down in my bed alone, I don't know why all the """"""""personal fulfillment"""""""" stuff even matters. What was the point of it?
So I want to know what I can do to stop obsessing about finding a partner. What do I think about instead? What do I care about instead? I catch myself ruminating sometimes, and I try to stop myself. But if everything in life seems pointless as long as I'm alone, what does it matter the universe is beautiful?
Any ideas?

"Hi
Recently I been diagnoesd with OCD although the diagnosis is still ongoing (I am awaitng a assessment bya psyciatrist) I decided impulsivly to tell one of my work colleagues.
To put it bluntly whilst he inital (for 5 minates) seemed quite understanding he has subsequently acted like a complete idoit making fun of my compulsive behaviour and generally acting like a insensitve moron.
I am findind it outragiously hard at work.
The most major part of my symptons are that I have to really strugle to stop my self saying some really quite lude thing. It has only happened a couple of times and never at work or in the presence of my work cooleagues.
Whilst I have always sworn quite alot I am definatly swareing much more.
Now they my colleague who knows about my OCD has got the rest of the office to agree to a swarebox which unsupprisingly I and dead against.
My boss has threatened me with a written warning if I don't agree to the sware box.
The problem is the more stressed out I get the worse my symptoms get.
I beleive I am in a no win situation - I agree to the swarebox then my symptom will almost certainly get worse
- If I don't agree to a swarebox then I am probably going to lose my because
I have OCD
HOW IS THIS FAIR ?

"Hey,
I'm dealing with my contamination OCD with help from my psychologist and am going to be referred for in-patient OCD treatment soon BUT I'm really struggling with """"""""magical thinking"""""""" i.e. the fear that if I do something minor something awful will happen. This affects lots of activities e.g. choosing what pen to use, whether or not I send an email, what products to use in the shower, how many times to do things, whether or not/when I go to bed- sometimes I feel like every action is a prayer for good or bad.
I know I've written about this a few times before but how do I get rid of it?! I've not found a self-help book that's useful on the topic and I'm not sure how to deal with it! I've coped with many of the other common themes of OCD but this one seems to stick and pop up at times of stress.
Any help would be massively appreciated or even shared experiences xxx

"Hi! I hope you are all enjoying your weekends, and that your ocd is under control.
I suffer from Pure O;obsessive thoughts that I might find certain children and/or certain men attractive. As I am a school teacher, I have to face my ocd every day at work.
I had a rough week last week. I have learned that you have to face your ocd at every opportunity, and if your ocd thoughts trigger, face them, accept them as ocd thoughts and allow them to be there. You have to face them, but not respond to them or question them in any way. The anxiety rises, but with repeated exposure to my ocd, the anxiety does eventually drop.
So what type of exposure do you do, to your ocd;
I have;
1. Looked at gay websites and even gay porn, to face my gay ocd fears.
2. Looked at pictures of cute kids in magazines and newspapers and refuse to respond to my ocd.
3. Looked at pictures of good looking guys in magazines,on tv and on internet.
4. Glance at men naked in lockerroom, at gym and at football;allow any ocd thoughts to arise and face it with no rumination.
5. I saved pictures of Bear Grylls, Richard Hammond, Luke Mitchell and other guys who trigger my ocd and look at them every now and again.
6. Friends who spark my gay ocd;i actively go to meet them in town or have even gone away for a few days with a mate who triggers my ocd;was tough,but was proud of myself.
7. My nephew sparks my ocd, so I offer to take him to the playground.
8. in school I try and face the kids who spark my ocd;when teaching look at them, talk to them,
9. The latest thing I have done;i have recorded myself describing a sexual encounter with a man/friend/child. Just descibing the absolute worse case scenario. Then I listen back to it so my mind is trained to be used to/habituated to these ocd thoughts.
Fred Penzel recommended these techniques in his articles.
So what to you do to face your ocd?
Have you tried any of the above?","['hope', 'joy', 'drop', 'site', 'fear', 'anxiety', 'anxiety', 'Thought', 'OCD']","['rumination', 'obsessive']","['rumination', 'anxiety', 'obsessive', 'OCD', 'site', 'drop', 'fear', 'Thought', 'joy', 'hope']",1.0,,,,
"Hi, Folks
I hope you're all managing as best you can today...
I was wondering how other people felt following a spike, and working through it? Just had a huge spike and a panic attack and used the Four Steps to manage it. Feeling a lot calmer, but very strange: tired and numb but kind of on the edge of something dark-feeling. My fear is about having caused harm, accompanied by intrusive memories, and I don't come round from a spike necessarily feeling it is an irrational fear, just that there is nothing a can solve about it. So I am still left with feelings of not deserving to do anything good for myself - like, I feel hungry but don't want to eat. I don't know. It just feels so different from the sort of exposures where you can congratulate yourself for not repeating an unnecessary ritual, for example. I feel calm but dreadful. Does any of this make sense?
Anyone's experiences of what to do after """"""""coming down"""""""" from a spike, or working through an exposure, would be really really appreciated.

"I suffer with contamination OCD (toilet germs). About a year and a half - two years ago someone brought in a soaking wet bag into work as they had found it. I then had to search the bag, put details in a book and put it into a safe. Since then I have had to touch the safe and book. There were no gloves when I searched the bag so I did it with my bare hands. I obviously touched other things and the key to the safe. Yesterday and today I had to put something into the safe and I am still worried about the germs and had to wash my hands and wrist as my wrist touched the safe. I remember at the time it had not been raining so I immediately thought it had been put down the toilet (maybe it was stolen) and that is why it was so wet. The book then touched the table today as I had to write something in it. I did try not washing hands and wrist but did not manage it. Even things I touched years ago I still feel anxious about touching. How do you forget about the germs even after such a long time?

"I'm just trying to figure out my experience of depression / OCD and work out exactly what it is that keeps happening.
I've had (and still have) low level OCD since I was about 15. I mean things like worrying about is something asbestos or did Ieave the gas on. But then I go through much more intense episodes, when it really gets on top of me.
My symptoms would be maybe feeling very tired one day, then the next day the intense rumination starts. After that it can get to the point where I can't get out of bed in the morning, I can't eat, I'm extremely anxious and can't stop the thoughts. I can't think straight - I'd do pretty much anything to make it better. Often Googling stuff I know I shouldn't, drinking too much at night. This will go on all day and maybe ease off in the evening. It can last up to two weeks, although sometimes it's shorter. There are various themes which come back, and sometimes a new one will crop up.
I take a high dose of venlafaxine which doesn't help much. Only exercise seems to dull it a bit, but often I can't get out of bed to do it. It's an enormous struggle to even get to the point of brushing my teeth.
Does anyone else experience it in this way? I don't know if it's depression or intense anxiety which wipes me out so much. I first had it when I was 23 after trying to get help from my family and being ignored, and then splitting up with my girlfriend.

"So this may get lengthy but I feel it will help me put things into perspective and to tell myself they are just thoughts. 
I would say it began around the time I was 17 and was triggered by an unwanted sexual advance by a friend. It was around this time that I began to discover my own sexuality and coming to terms with the fact I was gay. The way that he treated me and the confusion of what had happened led me to become a bit of a shut-in and reject any requests to out with friends. This left me feeling alone and questioning """"""""Why didn't I enjoy it?"""""""", """"""""I am attracted to him and had a crush on him so why did I feel so bad about it?"""""""" and other such mental questions which just seemed to go round and round and never ended. Perhaps one of the worse parts was that he was in my class so I had to interact with him regularly so I was also questioning why he did that but didn't like me or want to do anything else sexual. 
I think a few days after or perhaps even less, I distinctly remember walking to college and having the strongest urge to jump into an oncoming car because I just couldn't take the mental strain of, not only why I was thinking and feeling all these things but, having to see him again. I never really got an answer as to why he did what he did but I did come to the conclusion that he was young and experimental and he wasn't trying to cause harm, just one of those dumb things. Through all this pain, I began not going to classes and missing assignments so college really fell down the drain and gave me this sense that I couldn't really do anything or wasn't smart enough to finish college. All the ruminating was incredibly self-destructive and really set my self-esteem on fire and my family could see what was going on but didn't understand why it was happening as I had no idea how to tell them about what had happened and didn't understand why I should do so. I still hadn't come out to them then so it was another hurdle before I could even discuss the trauma I'd been dealt. 
My 18th birthday had come around and what most 18 y/o's would do at that time I also did. The majority of my friends, however, had birthdays way after mine as mines in September which is rather early. I had the desire to go to a gay bar and experience what it was like to be around more gay people and perhaps get to know some of them. With no one to go with, I decided to go by myself which was a rather big mistake. I'd met a guy at the bar and he seemed nice, was buying me drinks which felt great. I'd not felt that warm feeling of being wanted by another gay guy with the possibility of relationship (I was naive.) After more drinks we decided we'd go somewhere to sleep. We couldn't stay at his parents so I suggested we go to mine.
I was excited to be going home with a guy but was getting pretty tired, he had asked for sex but I told him I'd want to get to know him better plus I had no experience whatsoever. Once we get back to mine, I really just wanted to sleep but he still wanted more. With his promises of getting to know each other better and other words to get me to have sex I'd agreed but was still very hesitant. Once again it was something that I really didn't want. I remember during the act just looking at the door hoping someone would hear us to stop us. The feelings of rejection from before influenced my decision making in that moment and led me to a path of disrespect for myself and once again I was traumatised by a sexual experience.
This leads up to a moment that really confused me and set off my ruminations into overdrive as I really didn't know who to talk about with this. I was sitting in the garden just watching my mother tending to the garden and our two dogs running around and playing when the bigger of the two, Coco, came to me to be fussed and went in-between my legs. This gave me a great deal of arousal which I had no idea how to deal with and created so many questions in my head and just how or why I felt that. Over the course of a 3-4 years I would frequently get disturbing thoughts and feelings which I felt I could never discuss which severely hindered any chance of a close relationship, whether it be a friend or lover. 
When going in the process of college to go to uni I got talking with a guy on tinder and really got on well with him. We'd dated for around 6 months which was great but due to the wall I'd created in my mind any sexual or really intimate situations were hindered and cut short. It was after a long thought sessions over a few weeks that I'd try to tell him about what was going on in my mind and why any sex wasn't happening. The pressure I'd placed upon myself and the years long pressure I'd built up in my mind led to a horrible situation where I felt I was a monster with disturbing and disgusting thoughts. This was all blurted out to him in a tirade of crying and sobbing like a dam had just been destroyed with the chance of a relationship being a small town down the river. It didn't end well. 
Over the next 3/4 of a year I tried to understand what was going on in my mind all the while believing all these thoughts that were going through my head and trying to come to terms with the disturbing person that I was. This led to me trying to tell my friends and roommates that I was attracted to dogs and that I may be a P because of the thoughts that I had. They did not take this well either. I will say that this didn't occur over night and was a steady stream of information over those months. I now know that I was trying to 'confess' and that each bit of information I was 'confessing' was in the hope that it would alleviate the doubts and questions, which it obviously didn't. One of my roommates in particular had a mental disorder which I felt i could relate to at the time, though I didn't know why then. We got along great and I would try to 'confess' to him about certain thoughts and feelings that were going on in my mind. Whilst this is fine it was often the way I went about telling him or wanted to tell him that made things worse. 
I would often not want to talk about it after arranging to meetup and talk. The straw that broke the camels back was when I wanted to talk to him to 'confess' and I'd messaged him that I wanted to talk to him about the thoughts and feelings. This wouldn't be until later however and in that time his own thoughts were going round and had gone to pretty bad places which led him to assume the worse, which is something he warned me about in advance and is related to his mental disorder but I'd thrown out that advice as I felt I'd found the right bit of information to tell him. By the time we got to talking he was incredibly agitated and was quite loud and my other roommate had overheard our conversation about the disturbing thoughts. This then led to my other roommates finding out which had freaked them all out. This led them to plan to call the police on me, though I didn't exactly know this their behaviour was hard to miss when they intentionally left the room when I got back. 
Rather than cause a scene and have the police come to the house I had decided to take things into my own hands and walked to the police station myself. I sat outside and under a bus shelter and called my mother and told her what was going on in my mind and that I'm going to the police to confess. I also did this with my friends, the guy I'd been dating, my brother and my father. After this I walked to the police station and told them that I needed to confess to something horrible. I really felt that I had to go to prison to make an example of myself and to save all dogs around the world from people like me. They felt that I hadn't done anything to warrant an arrest which I remember feeling incredibly disappointed by. I still felt like a martyr, somebody that could save the world with this one realisation that I'd had. What actually was going on was I was in the middle of a massive mental breakdown and no amount of talking to me or convincing me could change my mind on what was going to happen. It was one of the oddest feelings I've ever had and hope to never have it again. The days and weeks afterwards were filled with a lot of alcohol and fast food. I'd gained about a stone and a half in a month, I'd spent around £2500 of my student loan in about 3 weeks. Just complete self-destruction. 
Around 3 months after this mental breakdown my father had died in a car crash due to drunk driving on the motorway. I think he was going through some OCD related issues himself that never got resolved. In the 9 weeks that followed my fathers death I had though long and hard about why I was having such thoughts and feelings and realised that they weren't me and that I desperately needed help. I have since gotten OCD therapy and still struggle to this day but I'm in a decent part of my life. I'm back in college and have started a lower level course to help me learn and take time off if I need to without too much stress. 
There's a bit more but my neck is hurting from a tension headache and can't be bothered to write more.

"Hi Everyone
As you all know my OCD is harm, i.e harm to myself via suicide and also the fear of depression, i.e getting depressed and so low that I would want to kill myself. So anything I read to do with suicide or people that had depression that kill themselves or even passing a place like a bridge and there are flowers where someone has jumped all these things set me off.
My thoughts are as follows lately:
What if I kill myself
I wish I could kill myself
Life is so boring
Suicide
Commit suicide
what is life all about
why are we really here
This is all so boring
So my OCD has a field day with me as you can imagine, I have rituals such as kissing things when I'm getting ready in the bathroom each item I use I kiss it and say a little prayer asking god to bless me in being really positive today. If I don't do these rituals its like my day would be filled with anxiety and the thing I dread most would be that I would get sooo depressed that I would kill myself. I also pray in the morning and say a few things first if I don't pray correctly it upsets me and I have to do it again and I've never tried not praying either I've done this for years.
I am morbidly obese a mother of four children, my partner works evenings his sister visits twice a week on an evening, I don't drive so I feel restricted and the house I live in needs a lot of work and enthusiasm which I lack as I'd rather move out of the area but being council property these things take time. I have tried various diets in the past and plan to go back to Slimming World as I can eat more but of the healthy stuff and still lose weight.
I had a bad virus and 5 weeks later am still recovering it attacked my ears, chest, head I felt full of congestion and had flu symptoms with it and thats when good old OCD kicked in with the chat that I have typed all about. I saw myself analyzing everything, ruminating over what I was thinking instead of letting it go and in the end succeeded in convincing myself I was depressed not poorly but depressed (see how devious this OCD can be!!) Its like I can't just accept that I was ill and thats why my head was everywhere.
I had been on sertraline and felt like I wasnt here it was awful but that was my experience and it fuelled the OCD further I am now back on fluoxetine 20mg a day then upping to 40mg in 2 weeks. I started them on Saturday and a few days in my head is starting to feel a bit clearer as I woke up with a bit more vigour this morning and felt less like I had dragged myself out of bed if that makes sense.
I was on my phone yesterday and I was searching how long it takes for sertraline to come out of your system when I came across an article on yahoo about ssris and I think it was in America but this guy that answered the persons questions was going on about how antidepressants make people kill themselves that wouldn't have done otherwise. It didn't set me off straight away but I spoke to my partner who said to me how boring (good therapy) and I told him that I wanted to search if thats true on the internet. I didn't and I still haven't so I'm proud of myself for doing that this far and I told him today about my thoughts about how life is boring etc and he said to me its OCD.
Inside I'm telling myself how do you know its OCD? how can he tell me its OCD? I am also at the point where its really ticking me off now about OCD as I'm sick of listening to it all the time in my head. Its like part of me knows its OCD and the other part of me doesn't, one part is angry that I have it and the other part of me accepts it does that make sense to anyone where you can be in the middle?
My thoughts come and go and some days they aren't there at all but thats when I have been looking after myself properly and eating well, sleeping well etc. This spell has lasted because I have been poorly and not 100% it makes me feel low as well and that feeds it too bloomin eck neverending circle, I'm waiting on CBT.
Thanks if you got this far reading it soz :blushing:

"Hi again!
I've just begun some CBT type treatment again (after doing some about 3 years ago which was really successful, but unfortunately all the yucky stuff has hit me all over again just recently!), but am having quite a tough time of it. I think this is partly because if this is OCD (really sorry - I know I shouldn't use IF! I do know I definitely suffer from OCD, but for instance the particular worry that's bothering me at the moment feels incredibly real, and I have to admit that its very hard to always accept that it is actually OCD rather than it being real!) it feels quite different to how my OCD was when I suffered from it 3 years ago. For one thing, there seemed to be more rituals when I had it before whereas now I'm just mainly plagued by the actual worry, but also there seemed to be more different worries (at least a few every day!) whereas at the moment there's just one that WILL NOT go away!
I wrote in a recent post that mainly its my HIV fears that are bothering me BIG TIME at the moment (they were always a big part of my OCD in the past as well as fears of cancer and fears of getting pregnant) and that a few weeks ago I got very upset saying a man had put a needle in me as I was getting off an underground train. It took a whole week or so, but did eventually sort of fade, but then a week and a half or so ago I was in town walking back to the car park (so not THAT busy an area), and I believe someone put one in me there (saw it happening and everything!) and I just CANNOT get it out of my head! I don't think I have EVER had an OCD thing that;'s lasted over a week and to me that says maybe this one really did happen! Can they last this long? Am I doing something wrong? Or does it mean its real?
The man who leads my OCD group that I'm attending at the moment suggested a few things for me to be working on last week including limiting my worrying to just one particular time of the day, which I've been giving a go. I do (pretty much!!) manage to wait until my """"""""worry time"""""""", but what's really awful is how much I DREAD the """"""""worry time"""""""" arriving. Its agonising, it really is to put myself through worrying about it and I get myself in such a state. He seemed to be suggesting that I'd get so sick of the worrying that I wouldn't want to do it any more, and yet, I really feel I have to spend that designated time doing it, but I feel worse, not better at the end of it and I DEFINITELY still believe the thing happened (perhaps even more than a couple of days ago?!)
I'm not sure if I've explained myself very well, but can anyone shed any light on anything? Am I handling the problem right? Can worries last this long? Can it really have happened? (My boyfriend doesn't believe me at all, but I of course think that's just becauise he knows I have OCD and would say that anyway! He says things like I would have screamed out in pain and people would have run over to help me) Also, I still can't get over this thing of SEEING something happen. I don't think my OCD ever used to do this to me and to me SEEING must definitely mean that its true. i just really can't seem to let it go, and am almost wishing another worry WOULD come into my head so that maybe this one could lessen.","['Treatment', 'Rituals', 'fear', 'OCD']",[],"['fear', 'Rituals', 'OCD', 'Treatment']",,1.0,,,

For example, for one person using a regular bar of Dove soap in the bathroom for washing hands after toilet and showering, how long would a single bar of soap last for you, roughly?

"I wasn't going to write a feature for the main forum at the moment, my intent is to get writing some interesting but non-OCD  stuff, take a break. 
But you you know how it is; an idea came to me, and it seems churlish not to share it with you 
How Stress Affects Our Ability To Tackle Issues
Some years ago a good book came out by professor Gary Cooper called """"""""How To survive The 9 to 5"""""""" - essentially a book on dealing with stress at work, but very good for tackling life presures  too - and since stress affects our mental well-being, and is known to make us more vulnerable in OCD, I took it on board.
Personality Types
From this I also moved on to looking at personality and issues of resilience - where I still struggle. The concept of the type A and type B personality resonated with me. Type A people are very laid back, tend to deal with things calmly - they are often referred to as """"""""almost horizontal!"""""""".
Type B personalities are inherently not stress-hardy, easily upset, The """"""""small stuff"""""""" at which a type A person would barely blink, can really throw a type B person.
How OCD Targets The """"""""Small Stuff""""""""
In OCD, the things we obsess about can be that sort of thing, small stuff but within a theme onto which the  OCD focuses and doesn't let go. We know deep down it's not valuable or important,  but we can't stop connecting with it and tension and anxiety and compulsing  (disorder) are the consequences.
Making Changes
So how do we stop sweating that small stuff? And can we change our personality type?
Dale Carnegie also has a chapter in his book  on reframing and looking on the bright side - when you are faced with a lemon, make lemonade. If working in a boring job, find ways to make it better.
I saw this latter at my local health club. A young lady working on the reception desk, a somewhat functional job, in fact ran her tasks as if it was the most exciting job in the whole world.  She was happy and smiling, engaged with the members in bright conversation – always found the proper solution for their issues. She always dressed well, used minimal but attractive make-up, smelled nice, She was always at the top in the “staff of the month” awards and, not surprisingly, she rose through the ranks. She is now amongst the new customer liaison executives.
I also saw it with a friend unhappy in her work and her income. She and I spent time together whilst assisting at two seminars. She was pretty but not dressed or groomed well , not making, or wanting to make, the best of herself, not really making the necessary effort, though  I knew she too wanted to make changes. A baby came along, and she took her maternity leave and elected to not return - but when ready, find a better job. I caught up with her at a retirement party; I didn't recognise her at first - the duck had turned into the most beautiful swan. She was dressed well, wearing glam party make-up that really suited her, and a smile as wide as a gate. She had made changes, and they were so much for the better. 
Over the years I have often made a lot of lemonade from the lemons I encounter - it's those times when the juicer hasn't been working that my resilience has been poor . 
I reckon now that if we could stop sweating the small stuff, and surf over the bigger stuff, resilience would be going well - like the mountain in the wonderful mountain meditation by Jon Kabat-Zinn  (worth looking it up, it's brilliant ). 
I am working on """"""""letting go of the small stuff"""""""" - this is a particular area where I am not strong; not very proud, because I feel I let myself down. It's often little things, small paragraphs in printed material or little bits of black comedy that stick with me, and of which I struggle to let go, and on which OCD likes to focus. More resilience on this will I feel handicap any attempt of the disorder to home in here. OCD loves the small things, the things to which non-sufferers refuse to give houseroom.
When I am in a good place I do tend to have  power to gently ease away from these nagging nonsenses. When in a really good place, or not in a good place, is when I struggle - so more to do, and I am on the case in a sensible way,
My wife is a good example to me -  she is only bothered about big things, big issues. The small stuff she just sees as mental chaff anyway, so no big deal, and she doesn't give it time of day. So that is where I think we should be aiming our intent.
Personality Type
Can we change our response to stresses, influence our adverse personality type - which will then of course help resilience to OCD? Sure. 
I sat right next to my boss, a really laid back individual. Only once or twice have I seen him struggling in work, and - since he knew I could get him  out of those holes - he didn't panic but sensibly consulted me.
So rule one is to have a reserve position if you need it - I was his.
Rule 2. be organised. Don't take on more than you can handle. Learn to delegate to the ability of sub-ordinates. Lay down strong ground rules at work and at home, and make it clear these are not to be broken - get a grip on the children and the staff or colleagues  - make them know who is boss/in control of your area.
Rule 3 . count to ten. Don't react immediately - be a witness not a judge, take time out to consider things, look for better ways without anger or emotion - take that out of the equation.
Rule 4. Schedule breaks, buffer zones.  Select your own, but do as a dentist does. The dentist might deliberately leave gaps in the schedule in the morning for emergencies. OK so there may be a small amount of downtime, but if there is they can take a break. At work, I would always take short breaks after a couple of hours. Screen breaks anyway, but just a walk round the office would help me, and when I returned I would be stronger. 
Rule 5 - use messaging and diary systems - make sure you return the messages, so ;people feel wanted and loved. 
Rule 6 - if necessary, make  changes - job, home, recreational - that will help you.
How many other ways might we come up with?

Basically a question. My OCD or 'awareness of', is always there. Yet I will show two examples of how I thought OCD works:
By the way, I don't mean any offense by the way I assume/d it works, like I know everyone experiences different types etc. so I want people to know I don't mean any offense with the explanantion below.
The way I think it works: get up in morning anxious/worried etc. > dies down over the morning > spikes in between time > four steps /relabel/reattribute/refocus > thought/worry eases away. But you always get the spikes etc.
The way my OCD seems to work: get up in the morning, OCD is there in my mind or worries > try to ignore it > doesn't really ever go away, somtimes it will ease off but it's always there in the background, even when trying to occupy my time watching TV etc., it's always on my mind or 'there' > in between time I get spikes and try to use the four steps to get rid but I don't know if it's working or not, the spikes seem to go but the 'OCD/awareness/worry' is still there.
Am I experiencing something completely different to other people or can other people identify with what I have written? (about my OCD)
I just can't comprehend how it can be 'there' in my mind etc. all of the time. I thought it was just spikes etc. Will CBT help with this constantness of my OCD, to stop it from always being there in my head pretty much 24/7?
Thanks for your help.

I'm a newbie. However sadly I'm not a newbie where OCD is concerned, I've had it since I was 10 (according to my shrink). Although I do enjoy washing my hands (always 3 times, thats my lucky no, which no doubt now i've admitted that something **** will happen), my OCD shows itself in other ways. I am totally obsessed with my health, my husbands health and my kids health. I ask if they're ok constantly,i imagine lumps in my boobs,pains in my stomach, cancer in all of us, constantly.

"I have OCD almost all my life but didnt seek treatment until 6 months ago. I didn't know what my problem was called until i stumbled upon it on wikipedia.
I've never relate my problems to anyone else with OCD. Most people i talk to can't understand OCD fully. I feel terrible, i'm always making up new rituals all the time and the amount of rituals i have to do just seems to be increasing. Very seldom do i stop doing a specific ritual. Here are some of the rituals i do.
1. Before i sleep, i'll touch the wooden table in front of my bed 3 times, chanting """"""""touch wood""""""""
2. I'll look at the time on my mobile making sure it's not on the 4th min. If it does, i'll look at the 3 times and wait till it changes to the 5th.
3. Before i sleep, i'll go to the washroom to urinate at least 20 times. The worst time i've got was last week, when i went back and forth to the washroom from 12am - 5am with intervals of 10 - 20mins.
4. When i push a button, (e.g. my monitor, remote controls) i'll make sure i pushed it fully. Pressing it down completely.
5. When im surfing the web, i'll scroll the pages up and down to the maximum before i click on a link. That doesn't happen all the time, but enough to **** me off.
6. When i read a texts (books, subtitles, forums etc.) i have this habit to read a few times so that i don't miss a single letter or punctuation in the sentence. Because of this, i can take more than an hour to complete a 45min show.
7. To cut things short on this one, i do most of my stuffs in sets of 3s. And im have a minor phobia of the number 4.
8. Before i get onto my bed, i have to make sure both my heels touches the ground.
9. I never fail to say thank you when someone does me a favour. If i think he/she didn't hear me, i'll repeat it.
10. I count the number of cigarettes i have left before i sleep.
How serious is my OCD? This are some of the problems i have that i can recall now. Even though i've lived with OCD for so long, recently i'm getting real frustrated with it.","['Treatment', 'Rituals', 'OCD']",[],"['Rituals', 'OCD', 'Treatment']",,1.0,,,

"To beat OCD we have to accept uncertainty, we all know that. What I fear could be true, could be false. I can't get the answer, it may be yes may be no. Now while doing that what works best for you? As someone suggested when a spike comes as a question """"""""did this and this happened?"""""""" I can try to answer it with """"""""may be, may be not"""""""". But in my case it triggers rumination. Like whatever there is no chance that it have happened? Is there any chance at all? Like this. 
But just letting the thought come and doing nothing and just watching it is what works for me. It come and after sometime automatically I am distracted to some other thought. As if the thought just float by.

"Well, here I go again...
I think I have a pretty good understanding of OCD and also on how to work with it, and I keep researching.
I also think I can relabel others fears as OCD, and I hope that the advise I offer is usable or at least not making the problem worse...
However I can't seem to make it work on myself, which I know is very common.
I guess I kind of know that I have OCD, or else I probably wouldn't find this forum so useful and I wouldn't be able to relate to your problems.
I can also relabel my overcome fears (like, paedo, HIV and homo OCD) like OCD, and I am for example absolutely sure, that I am not a lesbian, and I don't have HIV, even though the thoughts seemed so real when they were there.
But with my always reaccuring and biggest theme, the relationship OCD, I can't work proper.
I know that it probably is OCD (and that I have recovered from it once and I felt fine in the knowledge, that it was OCD, for 2 years), but theres always the doubt, that it is not.
I feel like I really need the answer and I ruminate over everything I do or don't and everything my husband does or doesn't. I also always question my feelings, and I ask myself, do I like lying ind his arm now, and things like that.
I know this is totally the wrong approach, and I know that the first step is to accept, that it is OCD, but I can't.
Does anyone have any advise on how to do that?
I also have a question about exposure exercises, as they are not descibed in relation to relationship OCD anywhere I can find.
If you have contamination fears, you can try to stop your handwashing compulses, and when your are afraid that your mother dies, if you step on the lines on the pavement, you can do it anyway.
Please know, that I am completly aware that it isn't as easy at that, if it were, you would just do it, but at least, you might figure out yourself, that this could be the way towards recovery as painful it might be.
With pure O, it doesn't work like that - I actually don't know, what I am supposed to expose myself to and how???

I wash them once, I flick the excess water off my hands. I wash them twice, before thinking “that’s probably enough”, and flicking the water off them. I pause near the hand towel. “What if”, the OCD breathes into my ear, “what if you didn’t wash them well enough?” The cycle repeats itself and I’m stuck, like a robot, washing my hands repeatedly until my breathing becomes laboured and my hands become pink.","['washing hands', 'OCD']",[],"['OCD', 'washing hands']",,1.0,,,
"Hi,
Im new to the forum and hoping for some advice. I've been reading some of the helpful posts before signing up regarding breaking rituals such as distraction, hobbies and delaying. My problem is my rituals only happen at night, so I have nothing to distract myself and the desperation of tiredness overpowers me, so I complete rituals in order to sleep. I check things - light switches, door handles, hobs, candles, fridge doors. I have to go outside to check the back gate too, and in this weather is doubly unpleasant if I get stuck there. I have to chant and check at the same time and can't stop until I feel satisfied. A good night takes about an hour, usually if bf does it with me. If not I can do it for hours. Its causing huge problems for my relationship, forcing my partner to engage in this with me when he is tired. It's also resulted in me drinking a lot to try lessen the dread I feel coming on towards bed time. I don't know how to break this but I need help. If anyone has any advice or techniques that would be great. 
I spoke to a psychologist about 2 years ago about it, who said I had to lie in bed and ignore the urges even if it means not sleeping. But I just can't, it's too intense to ignore. If I do nod off and haven't completed them, I often have dreams that wake me up about the checks.

"I have pretty much covered every ocd theme in my life, most are now dormant or tick along with not much bother, contamination, harm and pocd are my current really bad ones and I struggle every min of every day against one or more of these worries. Within each one there's so many triggers, for example within contamination I worry about asbestos, lead, other metals, glass, stone, sand, any dust of any kind, chemicals, basically any foreign substance or possible poison entering my own but mainly my son's body and causing harm. That's a bit of background.
On Tuesday I was rushed into hospital with a suspected ectopic pregnancy. In A&E in the rush and chaos of it all a nurse put a cannula into my arm behind my elbow to administer morphine, another drip of liquid and to also get blood from me. She did a terrible job and after several failed attempts finally got the cannula into my arm, but badly - they were unable to get blood from it (about an inch came out, before they tried dragging more out which was a yucky substance instead of blood). Anyway, as a result my arm is in a right mess; it's heavily bruised, hurting so badly now even though it was days ago and the ocd has hooked into this and is now trying to convince me that the needle snapped in my arm and is now floating around in my bloodstream. I know this is not the case (well the none ocd bit of me does), but ALL day since the thought first entered my head it's been driving me mad. The thing I'm asking for help with is how to deal with the thoughts now? I am confident with cbt techniques for contamination (not washing my hands, touching stuff I don't want to touch etc), but if the rituals haven't yet started, what can I do to make sure they don't start (I'm feeling the need to keep my arm below my heart, to ask for reassurance, to google??? etc), but resisting doing all those things, this is the right thing to do isn't it - Is there any other techniques I can use?
Since being in hospital I've had several other ocd spikes about it all, but this one seems to be the one I've hooked into. Grr!

"Hi there,
Have contamination OCD. Have a therapist but sadly she has been ill for last month so Im struggling a bit. Needless to say, after a weekend of challenges, sunday evening it all got n top of me and my partner threw something in the bin. I thought that his hand had touched the bin and asked him to wash his hands around three or four times...
The last time i asked he refused and kicked me so that his shoe touched my skirt. enough was enough and I ran to the shower. This is the best place I can think of to go to when I can feel a full blown anxiety attack beginning. But he then turned the boiler off so I was stood in the freezing cold water with no way of calming down. He said i was wasting water and accused me of not caring about the water bills which he pays (i am on maternity leave so bills of that nature have been left to him). He pushes and shoves me, accuses me of attention seeking and making a drama 'because i enjoy it' constantly reminds me that I am living in 'his house' and without his financial support (due to my maternity) i would be lost. I ended up calling the police because he was getting particularly aggressive and so he ran off, I haven't heard from him for 12 hours.
He is right, I am thankful to have a roof over my head, but i cannot cope with the aggression and abuse. Its like my mind goes into overdrive and cannot distinguish between a real threat and an imagined threat when the two are going on simultaneously.
He has been to therapy with me, he knows that there are certain times of day (around 7-10pm) where my OCD seems to be worst and we have agreed not to challenge my rituals too much at this time. During the day I do challenge myself and sadly for him he is usually at work during this time so never gets much opportunity to see it happening. On sunday night i am upset that he didn't realise that I was struggling with the anxiety and didn't help me with any calming down techniques, (like counting back in multiples of 7 from 100)….in fact he actively took the calm environment i need to practice these techniques away from me.
I know my OCD is frustrating and i know that I make his life VERY hard. I check up on everything he does around the house and ask him to wash his hands after most activities. I don't like him seeing certain friends because they are dirty and if he does he has to change when he gets back in the house.
I question where he is going and what he is doing. He doesn't get much space from me at home which is why I send him to the pub to see his friends now and then, but he comes home drunk and can be really horrible to me.
Has anyone else had similar conflict, primarily caused by OCD? How did you manage the agression?
I've asked him if he wants to go to relationship councilling but he is not keen...

"Hey guys.

Ive got a question.

One of my most painfull and depressing ocd theme is the one where i feel incredible guilt, shame, angers, and sadness for things ive done in my past. ( bullying people and even former pets we had, cheating, telling lies, hurt people etc etc).

even tough i can honestly say that as the person i am right now i am very pleased, my morals are good, and i really am very loving and compassionate right now.

I just cannot seem to overcome this past 'me'. almost daily i get memories popping up from stuff ive done in the past which i really really regret. i Immediatly feel so much guilt i feel like breaking down in tears everytime.

i also have lots of other OCD themes but these can sometime fade away because deep down i know they are false.

But the things ive done in the past are true and so i cannot seem to let them go.


My mind just tells me that i somehow need to fix all my wrongdoings, confess it all into detail to my wife and family before i could find peace for my past.


some advice would be more then welcome, i really am very sad. and also angry at myself for being such an ******* back in the days.","['shame', 'anger', 'sadness', 'Bullying', 'compassion', 'regret', 'OCD', 'guilt']",['theme'],"['theme', 'Bullying', 'anger', 'sadness', 'shame', 'regret', 'compassion', 'OCD', 'guilt']",1.0,,,,
"Hi everyone
Just wanted to share a simple method I've been trying to help you distinguish between what's a legitimate thought or just OCD. Its a method by Dr. Steve Phillipson which I have found extremely useful. It involves two concepts: risk taking and living with uncertainty. The first step is to detect when you are having an OC episode by the presence of anxiety, which is a key warning sign. Once there, if the thought came with a rush of anxiety, feeling of urgency, and guilt, make the choice to take the risk and go with the ambiguity. What I mean by this is """"""""let the thoughts be there"""""""" by acknowledging its presence, then shifting back to whatever you were doing before you had the thought or any activity of your choice. For instance, in my case, I usually get thoughts that I somehow got injected with a needle that was contaminated by HIV, perhaps when picking something off the floor, even though there clearly was no needle on the floor. This thought usually comes with a rush of anxiety, followed by an urge to do mental ruminations to reassure myself that there was no needle on the floor and that there was no way I could have gotten HIV. The proper response would be to tell your brain """"""""Ok, perhaps there was a needle on the floor and I got poked accidentally. I'm willing to live with that possibility and not undo the danger"""""""". This response shows your brain that: 1. you're accepting the thought, letting it be there, allowing space in your brain for it, and not fighting it. By doing this, you show your brain that you are not afraid of the thought and that you're willing to live with it for as long as OCD decides to deal it out. 2. by accepting the presence of the thought, you're telling your brain that it can stop warning you of the """"""""risk"""""""" since you have already made room for it in your mind. Another way of looking at this is that """"""""you allow the possibility of the risk being real, but you make the choice to take the risk and not undo the danger (by doing rituals and urges) by telling yourself that you will only attend to the thought when it ceases to cause you anxiety, guilt."""""""" This helps your brain to make the decision to take the risk and live with the uncertainty.
As for myself, I am applying these principles. I never said it was easy. In fact, it is extremely hard. Sometimes you feel like ****, yet you must go on. Always try and remember that you have a choice, that you are not powerless against OCD. OCD feeds on your weakness, desperation, and guilt to lure you into its traps. You have to WILLINGLY make the choice to take the risk and accept the uncertainty, regardless of how you feel (anxious, guilty), whenever there is that lingering doubt in your mind of whether this is OCD or a """"""""legitimate thought"""""""". This is one of OCD's cleverest traps. Whenever you realize that there is the presence of doubt, doubt of whether this danger is real or not, treat it as OCD, and make the choice to take the risk and live with the uncertainty.
I've found that by applying these principles, on taking a leap of faith, I've gotten a portion of my life back. But I've still got a lot of work ahead of me. I still have setbacks and days when it is just so hard to deal with OCD, but I somehow still keep plowing through and try to the best of my abilities to keep applying the principles necessary to manage OCD. I've especially found reading forums like here especially helpful. Its nice to see that you're not alone and that the people here understand what you're going through, so I'm incredibly thankful for coming across this site. I would also welcome any suggestions or advice anyone has on how they've been managing their OCD and what they found helpful. =)","['Activity', 'Rituals', 'weakness', 'site', 'urge', 'anger', 'anxiety', 'anxiety', 'guilt', 'OCD', 'Thought']",['rumination'],"['rumination', 'urge', 'anxiety', 'site', 'anger', 'Thought', 'Rituals', 'guilt', 'Activity', 'OCD', 'weakness']",1.0,1.0,,,
"Hi everyone! 
  Bit about me first of all, I'm 22 and I've had OCD for 2 years now, and depression for about 7 - I was going through a massively tough time in 2014/15 when I was living in a different country, and that's when I developed OCD I think. I couldn't control anything else so I started rituals and became obsessed with contamination. 
I tell myself I'm fine and I guess I've improved loads over the last year (I'm much less depressed but still consumed by the OCD) but it's nowhere near enough. My brain is constantly worrying and obsessing over if everything is 'safe' (clean? Things not touching? Things locked?). I go through so much soap and hand sanitiser it's ridiculous. I have to wash everything before I can eat or drink from it.
I've been to various counsellors over the years and last year I did CBT with a noticeable improvement before stress got to me and I had a long bad period. 
It's really getting to me, like I said, I'm less depressed but constantly consumed by thoughts and I'm SO angry about what it's already cost me. 
So, my question is, where do I even start with recovery? Ideally I'd like to do CBT again but I have one day off a week which changes so it's not possible yet. How did everyone make steps? Any self help books? Self exposure? I'm worried I'm going to rush it and have a setback or just not push myself enough.
What should my partner do to keep me on track? (I'm going to stop making him take part in my rituals because I make him use hand sanitiser a lot and it's ridiculous).
any advice about where to start and how to self help would be much appreciated, thank you!
  Have a great week everyone!","['depression', 'Thought', 'Rituals', 'OCD']",[],"['Thought', 'Rituals', 'depression', 'OCD']",,1.0,,,
"I've had a lot of thinking-time on my hands this summer and I've been shut in a lot. When I'm partying I'm perfectly fine because I forget all my problems. :original:
I just had a lot of very weird stuff in my head, during my exams and after as well and it became more tough as time went on because I blamed myself for some of the ruminations I'd been having as I though God would be angry with me. I didn't hold back too much though, I did my best and I can't do anymore and there's no point persecuting myself for how I was; it was stressful and I was hemmed in a lot and as they say, I'm only human.
I was wondering if I was going to have a really bad life - if I would hurt someone when I began driving, would I worry all the time etc etc etc. But then I imagined my worries to be a kind of mat - a big grey mat that I rolled up and set on fire. Then someone nice came and picked me up and took me to where all the good things were. :clapping:
So I'm going to relax now and not be worried. God loves me and I haven't left Him, I haven't given up on Him and He hasn't me, either.

"Hi I'm new here but come here to ask some advice. 
  What im about to say and admit might seem a little bonkers to you all, especially those of you who suffer worse than I do. 
And yes, I understand how what I am about to say is illogical and a little baffling. 
  I have OCD, mainly with washing hands. I used to be a lot worse when it comes to posetions and items in the house. 
  I used to keep my mobile phone in a food bad when it was in any room but my own, or outside to keep it from getting contaminated. I no longer do this, but wash my hands after using it, if I'm going to use something in my bedroom after. 
  I I am keeping my bedroom as my kind of sancurary. Even though it is messy and perhaps the dirtiest room in the house as I need clean it, and I don't Because it daunts me doing it, what if the clothes I am wearing while cleaning tough a surfaces or object? So once it was clean I kind of left it, certain objects I can only touch straight after washing hands (iPad that is only to be used in bed after washing hands, lamp switch, to remote etc). 
  When i do clean the room it turns into a 4 day event, because I'll accidentally have my trouser leg touch The side of the bed and the have to steam the bed to ensure it's clean etc. I know this isn't right. And to avoid this I kind of stopped doing my room. So my room is the messiest and dirtiest in the house,yet in my mind the cleanest because it was cleaned and the only after washing hands was anything touched. 
  Here is an example for you, I can drink out of the glasses in the house if I'm not I'm my room. If I'm in my room the clean glasses that have been washed up, I have to spray them in antibacterial and then rinse them under the tap before they Cuba come in my room, yet I'll happily use them in any other room in the house as they're clean. 
  My my mum has offered to clean my room for me. I want nothing more than to treat my room like any other. But I can't. I'm worried I'll loose my clean sancurary, even though it isn't.  
  I dont know if I have written this in a way that makes sense or not. I don't understand it myself. I'll only get in my bed after having a shower, and only be able to use anything after washing hands, but can do what I want in any other room, how to I treat my room like any other? Just the thought makes me feel sick. 
  Any help or advice would be appriciated.

"Hi,
I cannot even tell you how much I haven't been able to concentrate on my uni work because of my recent spike. I have to hold it together or 5 more months until I graduate, then at least any breakdown or hospitalization or attempt at bailing out of my situation would not have any effect on my studies.
I have gay and bi fears OCD or I could even be bi. Heck - Im more bothered by my trigger/fear than the actual question """"""""am I x?"""""""". Since my biggest ever spike two weeks ago when I came face to face online with my biggest fear/trigger (anal sex: my brain says - 'you might like that since you're somewhat gay', 'it might be better than vaginal sex', 'it might be more biologically natural/standard/what the human body would like* than you think, why don't you investigate it and see if it is, although you'll end up pondering it/doing it after that’...) because I feel it is real, I have had a thick cloud of anxiety over me, which occasionally flares up into panic. This unsettled, disturbed feeling is terrible. I have questions about anal, and got a PM off Marky1982 answering some questions, but I am too scared to read past half way of the PM as it may just spike me into not being able to continue my studies. There are certain things, that if I read, I will die. There are certain things [which are unlikely knowing my luck], that if I read, would help me, but the odds are stacked like 90% in favour of reading something that will just bury me.
I basically need to know how to survive until CBT. I sent off my sign-up form last Friday, so I could be waiting a while. This anxiety until CBT? This spike is reocurringly devastating and confusing.
All I have been able to do is read the articles online (OCDOnline, brain lock 4 steps...) and drink camomile tea to calm the anxiety (dunno if it does). I feel like I'm wasting time. I could be being a 25 year old, instead of feeling like Im stuck in a hole. I can't wait to be talking about my spike in depth with a CBT therapist, and be in their safe hands in case I spike to death.
If I could wait 2 years for CBT, I wouldn't need it that urgently and wouldn't have gone to the GP in the first place.
* No offence by using the terms """"""""natural/standard/what the human body would want/expect"""""""". What I mean is that in vaginal-penis sex, certain things happen along a timeline, such as male arousal and all that that entails, female arousal and all that that entails, fertilization, bla, etc. My mind says that """"""""the more stuff of the vaginal-penis interaction that is present in the penis-anus interaction, then the more anal sex is """"""""what the human body would want/expect"""""""" and thus, you should do it. Why were humans created/evolved not to do 'what the human body would want'? Why would doing that be so bad? You might not even be that gay but you could/should still do gay stuff.""""""""
When my brain asks the above, it even throws out (the window) the question of """"""""are u gay?"""""""" and just focuses on: """"""""will you do anything gay seen as it is what the body would want/natural/everyone would like it if they tried it"""""""" etc.
It's a hard spike to deal with. It isn't just finding a man attractive or something. My mind is looking for reasons to convince me that gay sex is just like vaginal sex. I don't know what to answer back to the spike/screwed up brain, as I can't give it an answer that quietens it. Ignoring it is like trying to ignore an armed terrorist travelling in the same vehicle as you.
Please tell me of any spikes in your post on the first line as I am so vulnerable.

"Been thinking about ERP and I have a question that would be great if someone could answer. I know that it's advised that you create a hierarchy of thoughts and tackle the least anxiety provoking ones first. The thing is, how do you only make sure you're exposing yourself to these thoughts? Because if my brain knows that it's not ready to tackle the really scary ones then it's going to keep trying to remind me what those really scary thoughts are.
Do I do rituals to push away the scary thoughts until I'm ready for them? But then isn't the point of ERP not to ritualise? I'm confused.

"Hello all,
I am struggling at the moment with obsessive guilt. I've been with my partner for 4 years. I recently remembered an occasion about 2 years ago when I was drunkenly chatting to an ex on the phone, and I said something that was potentially flirtatious. My boyfriend doesn't mind me talking to exes, and I think I will have told him about the call at the time. (In fact I have been talking to my mum about my guilt and she said she thinks she remembers me being worried about it at the time it happened).
Anyway this occasion popped into my head last week and I haven't been able to get it out of my mind. I feel as though I should tell my boyfriend about it, but I have been resisting as I know it is an OCD thing. I don't need to tell him because it was a small one off mistake years ago, which I think I told him about at the time. I would only be telling him to assuage my excessive guilt, there would be no actual benefit in doing so. I know that I moved on from it at the time and stopped worrying, so I should be able to do that again now.
I suppose I am not allowing myself to 'let go' of the memory because I feel like I should confess, and if I forgot about it and didn't bring it up then maybe I would be pretending to be a better person than I am. It's been a few days now and I'm still anxious, normally spikes like this fade after a few days (I don't have full blown OCD at the moment, so I can usually get OCD thoughts under control reasonably quickly).
Can anyone advise me on what to do? Thank you in advance","['Thought', 'talking', 'guilt', 'OCD']","['spike', 'excessive', 'obsessive']","['talking', 'obsessive', 'Thought', 'excessive', 'spike', 'OCD', 'guilt']",1.0,1.0,,,

"From a mum of a 21old  young son OCD sufferer -  how does an OCD sufferer ' recognise '  / 'catch themselves ' ruminating and so try to stop doing it the many ways suggested? When he's in a whirl of anxiety nothing seems to get through. Looking for tips here from fellow sufferers who know what son is going through. 
If I am around I can help him to see the situation (very challenging for us both - and not the best way forward as I know I musn't become part of the whole process - not good - reassurance etc!).
I have looked at loads of ideas and suggested them but he finds it so hard to apply them as he just doesn't see he's ruminating.  He's had several rounds of proper OCD CBT and ERP treatment at national level / is on the cocktail  of meds etc ... so not new to this. There has been great progress but he's flatlined at moment and getting frustrated and down that he's not progressing. . 
The ruminations are on almost insolvable problems e.g.  - what is truth / what do I know / how can I be strong partly as the OCD has made him not trust his own thoughts at times  (all past ruminations he had got better at tackling at least in so far as physical ruminations - he used to write endlessly - now he thinks endlessly in his head and I 'm the only one at home  ... and I think sometimes better than the therapist  .....  that understands  what's going on) ; how can I fix my back' ( he has a damaged vertebrae and won't use traditional techniques to help relieve the pain  - which adds to his anxiety and depressed mood as it's stopped all his favourite sport and so curtailed exercise - not surprised he's down in the dumps!). he is often going to to bed in his clothes in despair plus ruminating or gets stuck in his room distracting himself on the PC   - unless I coach him out of bed /room and back to doing ordinary in the moment things.  So that's something practical I can suggest to him.
Is there anything else I can suggest please that I can pass on to him? 
He's in limbo at the moment and getting really down - so OCD getting worse  - CBT clinical psychologist on long term leave for a few more weeks and psychiatrist now only doing NHS work now not private so we've lost that extra help - NHS support is like buses - never there when needed!  So I'm having to help him and running out of ideas. 
I've tried to get him on these forums - but I think it just scares him more!   
Any really practical tips from those that know how hard it is to recognise the rumination for what it is and so apply all the techniques therapy teaches  .... which help him if he can start them off in the first place! It's that recognition and the first step......I'm the prompt for the first step - and I just can't be there all the time to do ..... and anyway he has to find his own way. So pl any tips  - ideas of what you do? I can pass on .... maybe something will help .....
Maybe any apps? Seen one specially for OCD self treatment - think is Canadian ... ( not s'posed to say which on here ?) .

"Hi everyone.
I've been a sufferer of OCD on and off, with numerous scary themes, since I was 6 years old and I am now 23.
I've been to therapy 3 times, but only this last time have I religiously stuck in to the work this being a mixture of CBT, acceptance, ERP, and mindfulness. 
I have worked ridiculously hard over this past year with a lot of set backs, but I can finally feel that the OCD has lifted, especially since dealing with the root problems of it all.
I just feel a bit lost now. I know people say they mourn their OCD when it goes. I'm very glad it's gone don't get me wrong I put so much work in, but now I just feel a little lost and depressed. My life was so overuled with OCD and rumination and rituals I've almost forgot how to live a normal life.
Sounds silly, but any ex sufferers got any tips on where to start with this? How can you start a happy, productive life when youve forgotten how, almost?
Now I've got past OCD my mind finally feels free, but it's so new to me that I kind of don't know what to do with it. Did anyone else feel this way?

"Hi,
One of the ocd checking things that I do is to check that things such as light switches and taps are properly turned off. I also avoid using electrical items such as fridges and cookers because I know tat I will worry that I have left them switched on.
My checking is particularly bad if I am going out somewhere and wont be back for a few days or before going to bed. I suppose that is because I feel that there is more pressure to make sure that something is switched off or locked or whatever it may be.
When I am doing these checking rituals I imagine that if the tap is not off properly or the light is not switched off that there is going to be a flood or a fire. Sometimes it can take me a long time before I am convinced that things are switched off properly.

"*This might contain triggers for others*
Am having a horrendous spike. It’s really depressing me cos I thought I had it under control; only yesterday I posted on here saying how great I was doing, and it got me thinking and bam!
So here’s the thing. Many years ago I went to a party (I was nineteen). For some reason only known to my nineteen-year-old self I got COMPLETELY smashed out of my mind on vodka. I was really messed up at the time with non-OCD issues: I was just in the process of coming out as gay and finding the whole thing really hard.
Anyway, at the time I had this huge crush on my friend. I ended up telling her I was in love with her and pouring my heart out, bla bla bla. The thing that really worries me is that I had a huge blackout and don’t remember anything that happened after that.
So anyway the next morning I went home, extremely hungover (probably still drunk). I could remember some of the things I said to my friend so I text to apologise. Then she sent me a text which I can’t remember the exact content of, and that’s what’s worrying me now. She said something about waking her up and kissing her. I think it was ‘you woke me up by kissing me’ but I’m not exactly sure. It could have been ‘you woke me up and asked to kiss me’ or ‘you woke me up by trying to kiss me’ but it was definitely something along those lines.
In the last year or so, I’ve started obsessively worrying that I sexually assaulted her and I'm going to go to prison. Even though I know I didn’t do anything more than kiss her – kissing is technically sexual assault, right? I mean if it’s not wanted? So if that’s the case, I deserve to be punished. I know she was quite freaked out after the whole thing,; but at the time I thought she was just freaked out because she found out her female friend fancied her.
I keep desperately trying to remember what she said in her text, but the more I try and remember, the foggier it gets. I've ended up turning the entire house upside down looking for my old phone and spending a fortune on sim-card readers but I can't get hold of those old texts. We're not in touch anymore btw which is why I can't ask her (not that she would appreciate me bringing it up now anyway).
Now, on one level I know this is kind of ridiculous… teenagers try to kiss each other all the time and it’s not assault. Plus I really can’t imagine I would have been forceful. She went back to being my friend straight after and we were friends for many years after that, so surely it couldn’t have ben that bad? But I know I used to get ridiculously drunk when I was a teenager and behave in outrageous ways, which is why this has an air of authenticity about it. The recent celebrity arrests for historic crimes have made it a lot worse.
A few weeks ago this worry reached an absolute fever pitch and I was going out of my mind; but then I started to get it under control. But now I’m thinking: is it really OCD? I’ve never really had symptoms like this before. Plus my fear doesn’t seem that outlandish?
Sorry for the long message. I just feel forever in the grip of this. It seems a bit like living with a wasps nest in my brain: it’s quiet most of the time but the slightest touch and it goes crazy. Does anyone else have OCD which is only focused on one really specific thing? Or am I just worrying because I really could have done something bad?","['fever', 'symptom', 'fear', 'Thought', 'OCD', 'process']","['spike', 'obsessive']","['process', 'obsessive', 'fear', 'Thought', 'fever', 'spike', 'symptom', 'OCD']",1.0,,,,
"Hi,
I had Pure O OCD and got a lot of CBT help with it in Bedford a few years ago. It improved immensely and I no longer take Fluoexetine. I find it still bites me though when somethign bad happens or if I am in a strange environment like a holiday. On Monday a friend of mine died, he was in 60's and had been suffering from cancer for a long time so it was always goign to happen soon. Since then all my OCD thigns have come back. I was upset at his death Monday and Tuesday but since then have found myself thinking only of myself (which then makes me feel a bit guilty).
I struggle with the idea that everything humans do is selfish. If I make you a cup of tea, it is to make me feel good. Or If post to help others is it also to make me feel good. I hate that. I also used to worry loads about religion and notably Christianity and what would happen if I did not believe in it (hell and so on) this has all come abck along with the constant rumination (crikey thats a good word!) about my thoughts. Checking them for purity all the time and thinking nasty, snidy things about people. Makes me realise how lucky I am to not have all this going on much now, but when something bad happens it hits me for six. I always required reassurance from Mum for thoughts and actions and notices this comes back too in troubled times.
Sorry for the rant but felt I needed somewhere to let off some steam. I don't use this forum much, perhaps that is selfish too as I did when I was struggling.","['guilt', 'checking', 'OCD', 'Thought']",['rumination'],"['rumination', 'checking', 'Thought', 'OCD', 'guilt']",1.0,,,,

Ive felt sad, lonely and depressed for a while, i cant seem to find anyone who ll accept me and im struggling quite bad, ive had cbt and part of that is to no longer have any more hiv tests as i was having them every 6 months or so then fretting on a new spike a day or two after the test, my doc told me i can no longer go on living my life this way since then i have had 3 sexual partners, i told one of them about all my problems but the relationship still broke down after 3 months. my cbt therapist pointed out that as a part of cbt i were to have no more hiv tests, i take 150 mg of venlafaxzine a day but have more recently been taking self prescribed double dosages, i feel **** my lifes a constant battle ive been having suicidal thoughts aswell.","['writing', 'Suicidal', 'OCD', 'toilet', 'Suicidal thoughts', 'Thought']",['spike'],"['Suicidal thoughts', 'OCD', 'writing', 'Thought', 'toilet', 'spike', 'Suicidal']",1.0,,,,
"Hi everyone. I'm new. I've had OCD since I was 8. I'm now 26. I've been having a bad episode for about 2 weeks now. I mostly do touching and counting rituals, to keep my family safe.
My husband tries to talk me out of it. He talks about how it really doesn't work and touching has no connection to keeping people safe. He says this everytime he sees me do a ritual. I know he has good intentions- he's a wonderful man. But I don't think he knows just how little logic works for me. I've tried talking to him, but what can I do to really make him understand? Thanks.","['OCD', 'Rituals', 'talking']",[],"['Rituals', 'OCD', 'talking']",,1.0,,,
"Hi Everyone
Yesterday my husband had a go at me when I was washing my hands (I was taking a while) he said he's had enough of seeing me washing my hands and feels that when he's home all he hears is water running. He was quite blunt and I got very upset.
He feels that my medication is not working and that I'm getting worse (I don't feel that way).
I tried to explain that I challenge my obsessive thoughts constantly.
I feel like I do struggle but his comments yesterday were very upsetting.

"Hello all,
I am new to the forum and this is actually my first post. I was diagnosed over a year ago with OCD (and bouts of severe depression) but had been suffering with it for over ten years. 
I would like to ask for advice from anyone who has experience of taking Lithium. I have been taking it for about 1 1/2 years and have had a very positive reaction to it. However, ironically while it does help me it has also led to a lot of obsessive thinking of its own and now that I have been in therapy for a while I am trying to work out how much of my worry, rituals, stress etc around it is normal concern and how much of it is the OCD.
With Lithium your salt levels are affected and you are told to be very careful about consuming too much or too little salt, and also very very careful about your levels of hydration. You are warned that if you become dehydrated your organs can start to fail and permanent damage can be done. Great stuff for the OCD to feed on!
So naturally I have always been extremely careful about drinking lots of water throughout the day etc. Any professionals I have asked have been vague as to the quantities of water required and any research I have done has just scared me more about the potential damage that could be done by not drinking enough water. Plus one side effect of Lithium is dry mouth so I feel thirsty all the time and am worrying all the time about drinking enough water but no matter how much I drink my body and brain keep telling me I haven't drunk enough!
Are there are forum users with experience of taking Lithium who have information or advice on this? I think hearing from other people who have actually taken the drug would help me.","['depression', 'Rituals', 'dry mouth', 'thirst', 'OCD']",['obsessive'],"['obsessive', 'depression', 'thirst', 'Rituals', 'dry mouth', 'OCD']",,1.0,,,
"Goodday everyone.
So I have had a form of OCD for several days now (in the past i had similar OCD themes btw). where I am convinced that I am continuously the cause of a lot of suffering.
It started yesterday while running (something I recently tried to pick up again by the way). The route goes largely through wooded area and on the running trail there are often slugs crossing, I was very aware of this to ensure that I would not step on any of them, but when I got home I was not convinced that I may not have trampled on one or more slugs, i felt a lot of guilt.
This made me immediately super conscious of where I walked and how I walked, this led to the thought that with every footstep, touch etc etc I kill thousands or perhaps millions of microorganisms. Thus I have now reached the point where I have thoughts such as;
* Why is my life (1 life) worth more than all those millions of other lives?
I am now afraid to clean surfaces, for example, because that could kill the microorganisms on that surface. and for what reason? so that it looks 'cleaner'?
I feel like everything we humans do is dominated by selfishness and destruction, and I don't want to be part of such a society.
What also hurts me a lot is that my son, who I love very much, often comes back in these thoughts, I think, for example;
I have to keep it clean at home so he doesn't get sick. But how can I put the life of 1 person above that of millions of other organisms?
So now I have come to the point that I feel I have to accept that I am a mass murderer, because I don't want to make my son a victim of this.

It feels really dark and bad to accept the fact i kill so many lives everyday / moment / hour. Its unfair.

I know that this is how everything is supposed to go, and that the whole universe is about life and death. But why tho? why do we even live? just to feel pain and die?

I am very confused about this, and it also makes me really question the reason why i or why we are here. What is the meaning of all this? all this life and death and suffering but also joy and happiness?","['guilt', 'joy', 'happiness', 'OCD', 'Thought', 'sms']",['theme'],"['theme', 'Thought', 'joy', 'sms', 'happiness', 'OCD', 'guilt']",1.0,,,,

"Hi everyone!
Nearly a week ago I eventually managed to pluck up the courage and tell my doctor that I thought I had OCD. When she asked me why I thought I had it I told her a few things, but not everything. She said I probably have it, but that I probably don't need any counselling and that she'd phone me so I could pick up some leaflets about it.
Even though I know she'll be doing a good job, I kinda feel a bit disappointed. I mean I know it's good news if she thinks I'm fine and i don't need counselling, but I guess I just thought it would go a bit further than just being given a few leaflets (which she hasn't phoned me about yet). I guess I wanted a proper diagnosis, so I know once and for all that is OCD and not just me being weird.
I think perhaps I didn't quite tell her the full extent of it and maybe I should go back. I know no-one on here can officially diagnose me but I would be grateful if you would give me your opinions
My main symptoms are:
1.Having to check the gas is turned off everytime I walk past it. I have to stare at it quite a while to make sure it's lined up, then often have to walk back and recheck it incase I missed one out. The same thing goes for checking any switches in my room and any locks on doors as I walk past them. This becomes especially annoying when I go to bed, because I have to check all the locks, switches and ovens and worry I have forgotten to check things and so have to get out of bed and go back to them, which is really frustrating!
2.Washing my hands. I have a sort of germ phobia. I hate having to touch bins and I get epsecially get worried when using meat. My boyfriend gets frustrated in these sort of situations where I'll criticize his washing up or when he's cooking, but I don't mean to - I'm just scared it might make someeone sick. My hands get really dry and cracked from washing my hands. It upsets me that I know people around me are catching on to the fact that I'm weird about these things and that it frustrates them too.
3. I have the worrying thoughts about harm coming to my family or sexual thoughts that I know are wrong and it's awful! It's not as bad as it used to be because I kinda assume it's OCD and it makes me feel less guilty then because I know it's not my fault. It still upsets me though, and certainly makes falling asleep harder.
4. I have to touch things several times for no reason. For example I have to reclick or go back and forward on an internet page a certain number of times until I feel ok about it. Also with what muscles I'm tensing and the position I'm lying in when I'm in bed - I'll keep moving until it feels right.
I have other things such as having to reread or retype words and I'm constantly asking people for reasssurance! To me all these things seem to add up to OCD, but I guess maybe the doctor's right and I don't need to see a counsellor because it's not like I can't get on with life...it's all just really frustrating and gets me down sometimes!

"OCD has become tougher and tougher on me. I am 22 years old and now it has become so bad that I can barely do a single thing without getting thoughts like i might loose people that mean something to me or something might happen to my body and more. I can barely wash the dishes, write an sms or unpack my bag without taking things out and putting them in again or erasing a word and writing it again. I feel trapped by endless rituals, and it is exhausting to do the simplest thing, like put a magazine away. I am constantly late and have headache.
The worst thing is I was just in a relationship that I cared deeply about which was mutual. I was afraid very afraid of loosing him which I told him in the beginning. As soon as something happened I started getting these thoughts but sometimes I said to mysself that I am not performing the rituals and then I felt I could loose him. Thing is only after 4 months he said he did not want to be with me anymore, without a reason. I lost him. Now my OCD has become even worse because I worry if i don' perform the actions I might loose another person. I cannot stop!I almost feel it would be easier if I had a problem with cleaniness because then nobody else's life is affected. Here I feel something can really happen to my closest people if i don't perform it.
I cannot afford psychiatry as I am a student and my parents are not the richest either. I have been on antidepressive before for a year but everything started again when I was finished with them and went through a hard time.
I have bought self-help books, please help!What should I do? Can I be free my working on it mysself?

"Hi, i haven't been on here for a while but the last 9 months have been so bad for me. I hope i don't bore you all with my story. I have just had a baby girl she is 10 days old and i love her so much and my OCD is going wild because of this i obsess over everything to do with her. It was a very tough pregnancy the worst pregnancy out of the 3. My meds were reduced due to the risks to the baby and then stopped in the last few weeks of pregnancy. I was at the maternity hospital everyday from 27 weeks because i was so anxious about the movements worrying she wasn't moving enough sometimes i was there morning and evening requesting monitoring. I was referred to a consultant and had various scans and no one could find anything wrong but i kept on at them begging them to listen to me. I got more and more anxious as the pregnancy went on to the point i would lie down all day and i mean all day and count the movements it took over my life i wouldn't socialise or go out anymore i just had to count the movements. Things then got worse I developed obstetric cholestasis (i had it in both my previous pregnancies) but this time it didn't respond to medication and the itching was unbearable and my liver function continued to get worse the plan was to induce me at 37 weeks but I couldn't deal with the itching it was constant 24/7 and i couldn't sleep anymore my skin was a mess. I was so scared that my liver wasn't working properly and it was getting worse by the day it frightened me so much. Things got too much for me and i began feeling very suicidal and had serious thoughts of ending my life and begged for earlier induction my consultant considered the benefits and risks to me and my baby and agreed to induce me the following day at 36 weeks.
10 days on and although the itching has mostly disappeared my OCD is even more out of control. I am petrified that my liver is going to be permanently damaged although its well known that the liver recovers from this condition after the birth and it did with my last 2 pregnancies but i have convinced myself i have liver damage and all sorts is going through my mind. I am due a liver function test Thursday and i am scared more than words can describe. I am feeling itches that i don't know if are real or imagined but most of the day i just wait for an itch and then go on about it to my partner driving him mad with it. My rituals have been so much worse and i can barely do anything for my baby my partner does most things and i feel i am missing out on so much. Some of you may remember that i have a problem with buying things and thats got so severe i can't allow anything new being bought and i have rejected all baby gifts and even clothes that we already have so she barely has any clothes left and i feel so bad for it i hate myself for it i just want to smash my head against the wall from frustration. My mood is so up and down i snap at my partner and other 2 children all the time my partner feels pushed away and says he is giving up on me. I feel so unhappy i can barely eat i just have no appetite and i have started to like the feeling of feeling empty and having no energy which worries me as i have a history of Anorexia and Bulimia but have been fully recovered for about 2 years.
I also have been diagnosed over 2 years ago with having a psychotic illness but never actually been told what that illness actually is my psychiatrist has mentioned possibly schizophrenia but i disagree with this. I believe in powers and hear voices and believe people can see into my mind and items of furniture can transmit messages into me. All this has got so much worse since the birth of my daughter. I feel constantly on edge and agitated and don't know what to do with myself. My mental health team don't know how bad things at the moment are but phoned me this week to tell me to resume my meds to which i agreed but have no intention of taking them as i have done a lot of research and have found evidence that they can cause liver damage and i am so obsessed with my liver at the moment that i can't bare to take them. Also i don't want to to take them because i believe they are trying to delete the important messages that i am being sent. My mental health team told me before my daughter was born that if i don't resume my meds after the birth they would do a mental health act assessment with a intention of getting me sectioned and forced to take meds which makes me feel even worse like i have no control over any aspect of my life anymore. I feel i can't talk to them about any of how i feel incase they try and get me locked up again. They sectioned me when my son was 4 months old and i won't let them take me away from my daughter. I just don't know how to cope with everything i should be happy but i'm not","['loss of appetite', 'hope', 'Medication', 'Suicidal', 'Thought', 'Rituals', 'anorexia', 'OCD', 'itching']",[],"['loss of appetite', 'hope', 'OCD', 'itching', 'anorexia', 'Thought', 'Rituals', 'Medication', 'Suicidal']",,1.0,,,
"Hello everybody,
I used to be more active on this forum about a year ago when my OCD was bad - I have suffered from contamination (incl. radiation), health, harm and checking themes throughout my life. I have always been particularly worried about causing harm to my children!
I had CBT and it has made a big difference. I am MUCH better now compared to a year ago.
Now, I am in the process of booking some flights to go on holiday and I am finding myself getting very worried about the full-body scanners which are in use at some airports, which use x-ray radiation. The thought that one of my children has to go through a scanner makes me very anxious. I have been reading up about the scanners and I am not sure whether I am falling back into the traps of OCD or whether this is a legitimate concern? It FEELS very much like a legitimate concern at the moment!
Confused...
Any thoughts or comments are very much appreciated

"I have once read that people with OCD can be chronically indecisive. Well, I know I am. When I go somewhere I usually take books with me. And just before I leave the house I go running back and forth, grabbing up or setting down books until I find just the right ones to take with me. I also am scared to try new things or even go to new places sometimes. I guess I am stuck in my obsessive rituals and this makes me afraid to make decisions on my own.
Is anyone else here also indecisive? Do you have a lingering fear of change, of something new?

"This will be my final post on this forum, since all debate is ended for me and finally so. I am completely cured, I am completely WELL, and not only this, but i understand ocd PERFECLY. It is no mystery to me now. SSri's are not the answer. CBT is not the answer. All the other nonsense is not the answer. And i don't wish to win you over to a new point of view, nor do i wish to SELL to you what is the healing. I will not accept a penny from anyone, nor will i ever publically proclaim what this ocd i about.
For those that feel humbled, who have suffered enough, who have suffered loss of heart, i simply offer you the real helping hand of a friend. If you are desperate enough, you may send me a message and come and meet me in Lincoln. If you lack TRUST, and you would sooner remain in your separate little world of paranoia and fear with doctors and all the rest, then that is of course your choice. They have ALL got it wrong. They are all just selling their drugs and their psychological babble to get money and prestige for themelves, while turning you into zombies dependant on their pills and their techniques. It is really not healthy what they are doing to you. Your sensitivity is a very great thing, you should not allow it to be suppressed with drugs and such. I am living proof that total transformation from ocd is possible. i have gone from severe ocd to being an absolutely transformed and radiant being!!! I would like to help you, because i have known the utter HELL of ocd. I will never publically advertise, i will never explain the cause of ocd except on a one-on-one basis, and i will never ask for a penny in payment. I do think thst this is a great forum, but on matter of principal only, i do not and will not belong to any ocd 'group', since i am not in 'the business' of healing. I would help you as a friend, not as a therapist. The great debate has ended finally for me, so for this reason this will be my f7inal post here. I have met a great many kind and wonderful people here on this forum. And I Am here for you if you need me.

Had an anxiety about the new forum look so posted and posted and like the topic said kicked OCD ass.
Also my ocd is pure o no rituals really but when i was seventeen i had obsessive thoughts about disgusting things i never feared i would do them they just upset me it upset me that others do them. ANd i could not stop worrying. And i took up Martial Arts and found that punching and kicking and inducing agression was a great way to beat the obsessive thoughts and anxiety it would make sense as anxiety is all about fight or flight and the agression seemed to get rid of it.
The thoughts went and did not return until recently but they are different now though.
Anyway just wondered what others thought of this.
It really was just amazing the toughts went just like that completely

"Hi, I am trying to learn as much as I can because my life with OCD has become unmanageable and I am going crazy. It started years back as checking and i would combine counting to try and reinforce it this was not so disruptive but then my work changed and I became fearfull of contamination at first it wasnt too bad and just involved different clothes for work and home and a bunch hand washing. In the last 6 months it is out of control, I cannot function without my rituals being in place they help me get by for a little while and I feel safe and clean but not for long and then I see a problem with my routine and I have to modify it and make it more comprehensive. My OCD keeps thinking of new things to be afraid of and I am now to the point I cant function anymore and it is threatening my job my relationship with my wife and kids because I insist of constantly washing everything and it is taking so much time.

As many of you know one of my biggest problems is i have such a big problem with buying things and avoiding triggers on routes which has got worse.
But i also have this new ritual and i am scared its a psychotic sign....
I think maybe some items in the house MIGHT be able to see/hear me so i tap them and say nice things and think good thoughts and be careful what i say and then it progressed onto more items and more and more and now theres loads of items that i think MIGHT beable to hear/see me. Tonight it really hit me i am so scared that i am schizophrenic I feel really anxious and if i don't tap the items they might get angry and punish me with the bad thought that i am thinking at the time. I mean isn't this a sign of schizophrenia?
I want to stop doing these rituals i want too so much and i want to go out there and buy things without feeling so scared and frightened without taking long routes and without living this constant battle how do i do it?
I am on a 10 month waiting list for CBT and i see my psychiatrist every 6-8 weeks and CPN every 3 weeks and they don't really know what to do with me because i just have got so much worse they just did a review of my care plan the other week and it kind of said just keep supporting me until i get this CBT. I know i will never recover 100% from OCD but i don't exspect that after 17 years i just exspect a better life than this - a improvment in my OCD.

"Just had a really challenging weekend... Way, way over the top... Too far over the top...
I decided to try and tackle part of one of my greatest fears, the food hygiene one... I wanted to try and face making a chicken dinner... A nice sunday evening meal... I tried to put myself into CBT mode, trying to use what I could remember from doing some CBT, a year or so ago...
I got some frozen chicken portions out of the freezer... It was a half-empty bag, that someone else had placed back in there, the someone else telling me at the time they'd put it in, that it was okay for it to be in there as it was tied back up... I tried to plan how I could use CBT principles to deal with my fear, very extreme fear...
I'd already got my sleeves rolled up, before picking up the bag. I got a dish to cook it all in,
placed it over the sink bowl, the bowl filled with washing up water, then took the bits of frozen chicken out of the pack, and placed them deliberately into the dish, I then defiantly licked my fingers, then placed, one by one, all the bits of chicken in the dish, licking my fingers between every single one, whilst telling myself it was safe, that it was harmless, wouldn't harm me, and as such, wouldn't cause harm to anyone else... I'd now used CBT principles, as I understood them, to defy the fear, to blow the fear out of the water, so to speak... Finally, I washed the bag before throwing it in the bin, and washed my hands before placing the dish in the oven to cook.
In effect, I'd tested the thing to defy it, then 'stopped' the experiment, by washing my hands after...
I was okay for a moment, until I got an intrusive thought, that my rolled up sleeve might have contacted the top of the bag, whilst getting the chicken portions out... Then it was freak out time... Total freak out...
I dipped my hands into the washing up bowl, washed the rolled up sleeve... Then I ended up splashing washup water on the front of my jersey, just in case, then I wondered if anything had dropped on my shoes, the floor, under my shoes, on and on, and on...
Total freakout... I totally lost control of my reasoning...
I'm back to the way my mind proceeds to 'mentally photograph' everything I touch, everything my clothes touch, saving it all up in my minds eye, ready for it to 'trigger flashback' at some point in the future...
In a massive mess...
I don't understand how other people don't even think about the things that do this to me...
I try so hard to let go... But still I believe I contaminate the world...
My GP has put me on tablets to try and lower the intensity of my thoughts, so I can try and turn this thing around, as I'm worrying too much... But am I?
I worry about the level of stuff on my clothes... If they look clean enough, surley that can be enough... But still I worry if I touch something, then something else... If one of my items of clothing touches another... Cross-contamination... Panic, panic, as my mind mentally photographs everything in the worst possible negative way, saving frighteningly haunting images in my minds eye... I'm so scared of all this, yet I know that this is the only way forward...
To live like this is hell on earth... I feel despair at how it reduces the things I can do, the way it disrupts absolutley everything I would like to be able to do...

"Good evening.
I hope you are all well. 
I will apologise now for what is about to follow, but I hope you can spare me a few moments to try and explain myself. This could be my last ever post on this forum, I just want to explain myself and would like to gauge your thoughts on what direction my life should now take. I'm at a crossroads and I simply do not know which way to turn. These last few days have been full of contemplation, and I need to find the right path and stick to it. 
I have always tried to live my life guided by the following, 'the right thing to do is always the hardest thing to do'. Never has this felt as pertinent as it does right now. 
As some of might be aware, from my previous posts, I've been in a battle with my own mind now for almost six years (I'm now 25). Whilst I have never had a professional and official diagnosis of OCD, I believe that I do have some form of it. Some of you may also know that I tried getting help with my mental health a couple of years ago, and it didn't go well.
To be honest, I don't hold anything against the mental health workers who I dealt with. They were doing their jobs, and given the nature of what I disclosed, they had to err on the side of caution. I confessed some quite awful stuff to them too, which would understandably raise suspicions. 
I lived in fear of being a certain type of person (I don't want to say specifically, but the lowest of the low). This went on for a number of years. Finally, I cracked. I thought, I might as well accept what I am. For the first 20 years of my life, I never had these thoughts and feelings. But they became real and a part of me. So I began to accept. 
It escalated and it evolved. I did things to 'confirm' who I was. Things that, today, only fill my heart with dread and shame. 
All the time I was doing this, I knew it was wrong. Though, I must explain, it stopped being a 'ritual' about confirming who I was. I just thought """"""""why not, it's who you are, this is a controlled way of dealing with it"""""""". However, a few times, it went too far. I have confided to forum members about what I did. Even then, I felt shame. But it continued. 
I became a deviant, despite never having any interest in these things for the majority of my life. I will admit that, to an extent, I found it pleasurable. 
Quite a while ago now, it all stopped. Of course, all along I knew what I was doing was wrong, and I found myself genuinely losing interest and becoming disgusted with myself. 
Today, hand on heart, I have no desire to repeat what I did. There is nothing. All that stuff just disgusts me. It might sound ludicrous, but I feel as though I was a different person during that period. I wouldn't dream of doing anything like that again. I'm a different person - I have rekindled hobbies, I'm studying again and I'm being more sociable than ever. I try not to think about what I did throughout that time in my life, but I guess it won't ever leave me and I have to live with consequences of my actions. It might sound equally as ludicrous to suggest that those experiences have only served to make me a better person. I believe I am a better person today than I was a few years ago. 
The problem is, I understand that the above simply does not cut it. There is no excuse for what I did, and I really do think that whilst it was undoubtedly born out of OCD, it evolved into something else. 
As some of you may also know, I've sort of been falling for a girl I've known at work for a couple of years now. Cutting it short, she's perfect. A month ago or so, I thought the idea of me and her getting together was dead in the water. Now, things seem to have changed. 
I'm not particularly a religious man, but I made a deal with God over a year and half ago. I actually preyed and promised that should he bring her fully into my life, I will believe in him and I will do everything I can to live a righteous life (I know, you might think I've gone mad here, but I don't have the words to describe what I feel for this girl ... and I have always felt I would need divine intervention to help me be with her.)I have never really tried to impress her ... I have made it clear that I liked her, but I've never put her under any pressure; I've always kept my distance and respected her free will. 
Things have changed and there seems to be an indication that she might be interested in becoming more than friends. Naturally, for a while, I felt nothing but sheer euphoria. Until a few days ago when it hit me like a train: I don't think I can be with her.
I have a past. 
She's a nice girl: educated, smart, funny, beautiful. She's my dream partner, and we get on so well. 
But how can I look her in the eye and pretend to be this nice guy when not so long ago I was doing those things. I knew her at the time. All I keep thinking is, """"""""if she knew, she wouldn't ever want to see you again"""""""", and that's understandable. 
People might say, """"""""you can't change the past, leave it there"""""""". But this is her life I have to consider. What I did wasn't a minor indiscretion. How can I look her in the eye? She deserves better. 
Whatever happens to me, I have to say a few things. I'm sorry for what I did and I know better than anyone how I am not that person any more. In fact, the entire 'theme' seems to have left me now. Occasionally it might come back, but I can bat it off. 
You might be wondering whether I even have OCD. I do sometimes wonder, too. In my last relationship, I had to confess everything I did. It got to the point where I broke down crying in front of my girlfriend if I saw a girl in the street that I thought was attractive. I felt I had been unfaithful and she deserved to know everything that I thought and everything about me. In fact, she did. Earlier in our relationship, before I got like this, we had arguments because I had kept things from her. In the end, I couldn't keep ANYTHING from her or I would be sat in floods of tears contemplating killing myself. I have spent hours thinking about things I've done in the past and how it moulds who I am today. I have demonstrated other OCD-like behaviour too. For example, driving around countless times to check I hadn't run someone over in the street. As I understand it, these things are all OCD-like behaviours. 
In a relationship, I give everything. This girl now, I am mad about her. It's a cliche, but I know nobody couldn't possibly think of her like I do. I tell God sometimes (if he's listening) that nobody would protect, love, comfort, support and cherish her as much as me, should he give me the chance. And I truly don't think anyone could. 
I don't want to keep secrets. I want to be completely open. I'm the most honest person you could meet. But I could never expect her to accept everything I have done. I am terrified how she would react, so how could I be with her?
But what's the right thing to do? I'm not the person she thinks I am. Am I?
The hard thing to do would be to cool it with her and let her go. She's leaving to go work elsewhere soon, so I wouldn't have to see her and I could cut contact with her outside of work. 
I appreciate that, essentially, I am getting my just reward. 
What should I do? Be frank with me, please. I am sure you can get guess the nature of my past, it's too much to try and hide, isn't it?
As I say, whatever becomes of me, I just want it to be known that I tried to be a good person, and I always will. I've done some horrible, horrible things and I am sorry for that.
I'm as soft as a brush. I've never harmed anyone, and I never will. 
It's best that I let her go, isn't it? It seems like the hardest thing to do ... which means it's probably the right thing. 
  Thank you for listening to me.

When they come up; I see my mind focusing in on the 'but wouldnt you enjoy this aspect of it - and wouldnt the rest of you shut down?'
My rationale knows and firmly believes that my depression/anxiety is what shuts my mind down, and what I focus on is just animal instinct gratification. If the event was actually happening; theres no way I would all shut down; theres no way it would happen. Its just fear based.

"This morning I woke up thinking that I legit masturbated over my sister during the night when I had no memories of that happening, neither I recall feeling aroused. I just feel like I did it and liked it? Jesus I only remember that at some point of the night I woke up thinking that and then I moved my head and my ear piercing hurt. I’ve tested myself doing different postures thinking of her, I didn’t like it I don’t know what the hell is this.
Besides I’ve been having terrible urges that have been feeling real as if I actually wanted to do it. I’ve looked at my sister imagine it, not knowing if I do like it. Then she touches me accidentally and I’m afraid to touch her back and then I don’t know if I’ve actually done it and with what reasons... In another situation I’m next to her in the elevator and I think “no sexual reasons” then I freaking touched her don’t know why! And then she walks past me, I’m angry at her and she’s angry at me and I’m afraid to touch her in case it’s for sexual reasons and I touched her with my coat or something  I’m so so disgusted...
Now the thing with my mum. She was standing behind me when I’m sitting on a chair, both of us looking at my laptop and I’m all the time looking behind afraid to touch her with my back, I try to tell myself “it’s okay, it’s mum” “this is just OCD” but somehow I end up thinking I’ve touched her for sexual reasons because I got this tingling feeling in my neck... and now I think I’m developing romantic feelings towards her! It’s so crazy 
My OCD temporarily moved to my older cousin. I’m sitting next to her and I think I moved the tablecloth for sexual reasons (which i didn’t like anyway but idk) and then I moved it again to see if it touched her leg...

"Oh my God I just can't go on any more. I've tried I promise you. I'm scared of so many things
I started a job this year after being at home for years. The fear was immense with this exposure therapy but I've survived. I am now nearly 6 months in and besides a few wobbles I'm still there. I also got a season ticket for my football club which I stopped going through fear of contact with others.
I also hate medical settings. I'm so scared of needles and blood and catching hiv. Today I went the dentist and it was way too much out of my comfort zone. The only reason I made an appointment was to get a check up. I wanted exposure therapy but it was just too much. I had to face radiation (another fear) with an X ray. I also hated the dentist in my mouth touching things and then putting hands in my mouth and then whilst all that was going on I felt something touch my leg (probably didn't as I often feel things mentally when under stress) and now I'm convinced that a trolley with a needle hanging off it scratched my leg or something even though there's no scratch on my leg or blood or anything. Although if I look hard enough I think I might be able to see something - but probably not. I think if I'm honest the reason I went for a checkup was reassurance on a little tiny lump - which the dentist said was nothing. So one worry goes and another comes. I could cry!!!
Sadly I think this needs to be the end guys. I've tried exposure and it's just too much. I was told by my therapist last year with CBT that each time you face fears the spikes get less. This one is huge and it's not going away. I don't want to be sectioned because of medical settings. I've had enough and it's only fair on my kids and wife to end this once and for all.

"Hi,
As with the majority of my posts I don't really know why I'm writing this since I know nothing will help me feel better but sometimes I just feel like I've nowhere else to turn. I can't go on like this. I'm sick of being who I am. I just can't be bothered with life anymore. I don't know why I should feel obliged to continue living a life of hell when there is nothing anyone can do to help. I've given up on the NHS now. Roughly 12 years of on and off """"""""help"""""""" and it's got me nowhere - not a single practical exposure session. Private wasn't much better - several grand and only about 4-5 exposure exercises (and considering I have had hundreds of different rituals) and apart from one, none of them were connected to my biggest difficulty. Not that it would make a difference now - I believe what I believe about myself to be 100% true and I know that there is nothing anyone can say that will change my mind about it. I can't go against what my brain tells me is true and I don't understand how anyone can possibly go against something that their own brain tells them. If I can't trust my own brain then how do I know anything around me is really what my brain says it is? How do I know I'm sitting at this computer typing this? My brain says I am but then if my brain lies then what proof do I have? I'm coming off my meds too. I was on 200mg clomipramine for over 3 years but it's done nothing apart from make me sweat like nothing on earth. If the mental health folk can't cure me then surely they should do the decent thing and put me down so that I don't have to suffer. I can't face trying to be a part of society when I believe myself to be one of the most evil sickest freaks in the world. People like me don't deserve to be part of society. I don't deserve to have a job and a life. I should be put out on display in public for folk to show their disgust and hatred towards me. I am such a sick and vile and dangerous person. I know this isn't ocd but I just don't know where else to turn to. At my last assessment to try and get help I told the person who I saw (who was something like an occupational therapist) that there was a part of my problems that I didn't believe was ocd and that I wasn't wanting to talk about it at that particular assessment due to how severe it is. She didn't even enquire as to what I was talking about. After that chat I was called back for a 5 minute appointment to tell me that they weren't prepared to give me any help. I'm not prepared to live like this. There are days where I am at the stage that I feel that just one more thing is going to go wrong and that will be it - I'll flip and do something drastic.

"i am desperate.
i am driving myself mad.
i can't feel ok until i have done what i call 'completing a thought'.
hello everyone. i hope you are all ok. i know that a lot of you won't be feeling completely ok. a lot of ocd sufferers just feel like they are simply surviving. what about enjoying our lives?
we know we can do it, it is possible... if only we STOP THINKING ABOUT IT.
well it's hard to stop thinking about it because we have a disorder from how much we OBSESS.
it is like you can't not do it. even if your mind is fighting you to think about other things, you keep bringing it back to that thing you are obsessing over.
i am having a really hard day today.
i created an account on here so i could ask someone for help.
but how can i turn off my mind?
can anyone really help me if even i can't help myself?
this is why i feel like i can't eat and i need to get into bed and lie there in darkness until i finally fall asleep.
this is no life.
i am my own torturer and yet i need to do it.
two conflicting things in my head.
i need to think about these things to 'complete the thought' and that makes me torture myself.
but on the other hand, there is the part of myself that doesn't want this and just wants to put the other part to sleep.
at the moment, the only thing i know how to do is to just get into bed and try to sleep and obviously that means both of these parts fall asleep.
sometimes i have nice dreams. and it's great.
sometimes i don't think of anything bad and i just enjoy the moment. but then i get one of those thoughts and i have to 'complete' it.
i have had ocd since i was fifteen.
it started off with just numbers i didn't like, avoiding them.
then there was the washing of everything and the avoidance of things that i didn't want to get contaminated with.
the worries of that is stressful enough.
i am still quite strange about numbers but the germaphobe thing has really stuck with me to the point where my family thought that the washing of my hands was helf-harming. it does actually hurt because the water is very hot and my hands are very sore but that is not why i do it. i do it because i need to get the germs off.
this is ruining my life enough but i have also been developing a new part to my ocd. i called it 'sick thoughts'. you've probably figured out what i mean really. and some of you might be suffering with this kind of thing too.
basically, i'll be thinking of something and then i think to myself 'i wonder how i could make this sick' and then i come up with an idea of how to make the thought all horrible and upsetting.
sometimes it's inappropriate sexual thoughts. sometimes it's based on worries.
whatever it is, it has to be the most upsetting and disgusting thing i can possibly thing of. and if it isn't, then i'm not happy with it. well 'happy' isn't the right word for it. maybe 'satisfied' is a better word.
so for example, without getting too graphic:
i'll be thinking about how much i love russell brand and i'll be happy and then i'll get the 'how can i **** it up' thing going on. and then i'll change it to an idea, well, an image, of rusell brand raping a child.
then i will get really upset and the evil part of me will torture myself with this idea.
i will have to think of it until i can picture it clearly and then something clicks in my mind like the thought is finished and then i feel like i can move on.
and then i say to myself 'it's ok, it's ok, it's not going to happen, it's not happening, i am ok, everything is fine' or whatever. it's almost like i am cuddling myself after hitting myself.
i talk myself through it like i am coaching myself to get over it, when only a few seconds before, i was was making myself think of that horrible thing and wouldn't let myself move on until i had 'completed the thought'.
i don't know. does anyone else get that?
it is definitely the worst thing i have ever had when it comes to the mental problems i have had in my life.
it is torture.
and i'm the one who's doing it!
i don't even understand why. why do i do it?
PLEASE READ THIS PART AT LEAST: if you don't get help now, it will only get worse. go to a doctor and get on the waiting list for cognitive behavioural therapy. i am doing it now and the results are slow but it is bound to be slow because you are trying to fix such a deeply ingrained problem. i am currently in the middle of freaking out because i am so sick of having this problem but generally, i am a lot better than i used to be. so cognitive behavioural therapy is the answer. you need to work hard and challenge your ocd. step out of your comfort zone a little bit every day. you will make progress. the progess will be slow and hard but if you don't start the therapy, then i can assure you that your ocd will cause you to get worse and that will be even harder.
if you don't want to go to therapy, think of it as the lesser of two evils. and you know that ocd feels like evil sometimes. cbt isn't evil. it is designed to help you enjoy your life again.
you know you already sit there and think 'all that stress, all that time i wasted'.
cbt, seriously.
anyway, this is me trying to connect with other people to help people but i also created an account on her just to say that i am so upset right now because of my ocd. if anyone has any words to make me feel better then i would appreciate it a lot. i feel really sad and angry. i am hopeful that i will get better because i have been getting better. but right now i just feel awful.
i hope you guys are doing ok and best wishes.","['washing hands', 'disgust', 'fall', 'hope', 'joy', 'OCD', 'Thought']",[],"['washing hands', 'OCD', 'disgust', 'fall', 'joy', 'Thought', 'hope']",,1.0,,,

I am really feeling so much worse lately. I feel like giving up on my mental health team and giving up on myself.

I feel so **** i really do. I am stuck in this life of OCD and other problems and i feel like no one understands me (apart from you people) i feel maybe now is the time 2 seriously give up on seein my mental health team and give up on myself and just accept this is how my life will be and if i really can't stick it then theres always suicide.

"I'm really struggling with my OCD; the themes keep switching. One minutes it's OCD about being gay/bi, the next that I'm a paedo and the next that I've got a rare disease. 
The other day I was at the park and I saw some squirrels. They came quite close to be and were interested in me. One of them lightly scratched me, not breaking the skin. I had a lovely time with the squirrels, but later on I was like, what if squirrels have rabies? I started googling rabies. Apparently you can't get rabies in the UK and the UK is considered a rabies free zone. Also rabies is not common in rodents. I always thought that UK foxes had rabies but apparently not. Also 2 and a half months ago I went to Greece on holiday and I got scratched by a stray kitten in a restaurant. I don't know if it broke the skin, but I can't remember that it required any medical attention. The kitten didn't seem rabid. I also read that Greece has been free of rabies since 2014. Now I'm worried what if that kitten had rabies and I'll develop rabies? The incubation period is up to 3 months or more so symptoms of rabies don't automatically show.
I can't get these thoughts out of my head. I haven't been sleeping well either and last week I was worried that I had a rare disease relating to sleep. I know that these diseases seem improbably and rare, but improbable and rare things have happened in my life like having a brother born with a rare brain tumour and my dad dying when I was young. I keep thinking what if bad fate awaits me. I'm scared that whenever anything positive happens in my life like at the moment I've been enjoying work, have been going out a lot and have been excited for new years; I'm worried that something will get in the way of my happiness. I also worry about my mum dying because she's under so much stress with my disabled brother (the one born with the rare brain tumour which left him with severe disability).
I know that I can't lead my life being so scared of everything. I don't want to worry every time that I touch an animal I'll get rabies or that every time I have insomnia I've got a rare prion disease. Also my sexuality OCD bugs me as well. It's no way to live.

Ive never been like this before this only just started happening like two weeks ago or maybe a little more than that..
Its really annoying cause if i dont do that and ask them to repeat themselves and or i keep asking is that what they said like it will bother me and will stay in mind if i dont ask them even if its been an hour or more or maybe like the next day i will still ask what they said but like sometimes i dont even care what exactly they said well i do care what they said but its like i just have to ask and just get it out of my head then ill be fine. But other times i do feel like i have to know but most of the time i just have to ask and get it out of my head and then ill stop thinking about it.. most of the time. But like the same goes for me sometimes i just have to repeat myself just in case that person didnt hear me right or something and also like me rephrasing things i say sometimes cause i feel like maybe i could of said it better or added more detail and thats another thing i feel like i have to add like a lot of details like when i text i feel like i need to add all the details of like everything that happened in that moment even if it didnt matter and if it was unimportant and didnt mean to be said cause maybe i feel like im lying if i dont add all the details cause i only really text this one guy and i have lied to him in the past and i dont wanna do that again so maybe thats why i feel the need to add a lot of details and stuff with him? Cause im scared of lying again? Cause if i feel like i dont add certain details i feel like im lying also. I always add """"""""im pretty sure"""""""" """"""""i think"""""""" """"""""yea im pretty sure i think idk but im pretty sure"""""""" like that multiple times in one text and probably like a hundred times a day cause if im not sure cause i always doubt my thoughts cause im scared if what if i dont remember that thought correctly or what if that thought i had didnt happen and if i tell him i always have to add the i thinks or im pretty sure cause just in case its not true or im just not 100% positive or whatever? but like it is sooo annoying.. I have never been like this but i think part of it is because i am scared of lying again even if its like accidentally lying cause if i say something to him and then like a day or maybe more than a day later i remember more details about that something i told him i feel the need to repeat everything i already but just add more details to it cause i feel like im lying if i dont... I dont know but i hate this.. i hate it so much like i feel like im going crazy and i cant handle it.. and i dont know what to do im even crying as i im writing this i always start crying when i think about this and how i cant handle it.. like i dont know what to do..

"For a time now I've been having these spikes about the past and the most recent one tonight was this HUGE worry that I was into beastiality. The reason I had this scare was because when I was younger, (I'm 19 by the way, I had this strange fanscination with horses. When I was younger I thought that horses were really majestic-looking for some odd reason, and the thing that really, really, scared me tonight but didn't think much of it at the time was when I saw this short skit on Saturday Night Live called """"""""Sexy Country"""""""" when I was about 8 or 11 years old. Well there is this guy whose supposed to be, I think it was Tom Green or someone, I don't know my memory is a little dry, but all the animals were talking like humans did. It later went to a scene where it seemed liked the guy was making out with the horse who had a female voice that had to have been from a hot babe. And so I tried to find this skit on the internet because of the scene. And now looking back on it, I feel like such a ******* freak!!! I have NEVER, EVER had any fantasy about wanting to have sexual intercourse with an animal, nor do I want to because it is just WRONG!!! It was so long ago and I don't know if I was just strangely curious or what. But when I remembered this tonight I once again felt that cold, chilly sweat and I felt like I wanted to punce myself because I felt so sickened by the guilt and the memory. The other memory I had was watching that movie Bachelor Party with Tom Hanks, and there was a scene with what's called a donkey show (which I didn't know what that was at the time) which some characters saying this hot girl was going to screw the donkey, and I didn't think of it much but my mind is telling me right now that I may or may not have """"""""liked it"""""""" which once I found out later when I was about 15, I honestly did feel disgusted.
I know this post is not only gross and weird, but please don't think of me as such. I'm NOT into beastiality. It is wrong, it is perverted, and just sick. I don't know if this was all just some strange """"""""phase"""""""" I went through when I was younger, but looking back now in my state, I hate myself so much. Can anyone give me some words of comfort? I could really use some right now.

"Basically I'm in massive state of confusion. Yes I have OCD which at times causes me to excessively clean the bathroom to the point I clean it with the shower very intensely including the on off fawcett on bath taps etc. Now there is some ( I think it's called filler ) that sits between wall and bath sides but it's forever coming away it gets mouldy and needs replacing frequently. My partner constantly tells me off for showering the bathroom because off all the water which at times runs down the walls in the room downstairs when the filler wasn't on properly. Anyway I keep thinking that water may have gone on to the electrical wires in the room downstairs since I've been doing this eractic cleaning.  Do I get an electrician to check and check the circuit breaker working or am I letting my anxiety do my thinking. I really don't know? There is currently a water mark on the ceiling of the room downstairs which may have been there a while but of course is evidence water has leaked through st some point?

"I seriously cannot accept that these thoughts are just OCD. For the past two days I have had POCD thoughts that feel so real I just can't seem to see how they are OCD. I even sometimes feel like I am agreeing with the thoughts, like maybe I really would be interested in sexual acts like that. It is sickening and disturbs me but at the same time it feels like I am having feelings and urges because of the sexual ideas in the thoughts.
I don't get it!
My therapist said that it is all OCD. No matter what emotional feelings, physical sensations, thoughts or urges are coming up - she said they are all part of how I conditioned myself due to my over valuing of my thoughts. I can't seem to accept that though. I will get a thought of a naked intimate situation with these POCD thoughts and then I will have this reaction like, ''no, I don't want that'' but then it will feel like ''maybe I really would enjoy it, maybe even more than with my husband or any other men''(and I get these feelings like I really would). I then can't get the thoughts out of my mind, they just linger there and I get groinal responses that literally sometimes make me feel like I want to have sex or like I want to masturbate. I have never masturbated to the thoughts and I would kill myself if I ever did. I also have often avoided sex with my husband due to fear of the thoughts popping in.
This is probably the 5th time I have posted in the past few weeks about this same thing but I am REALLY struggling with this theme still. I just don't understand these emotional feelings or urges! How did I go my whole life without having these feelings and thoughts and now for nearly the past year I am completely plagued with them and I feel like such a bad, sick person now. But at the same time I get thoughts that feel like I am agreeing with these things.

"Hi,
I just wanted to ask for opinions, I beg you not be too harsh on me, I already don't like myself. I did some bad things and I don't knot how to accept what I did. Does anyone had any ideas about how to cope with guilt? Also, I am unsure if I have hyper-responsibility OCD, as I have spent the majority of the past month ruminating and analysing over and over again about the issue below (also on and off for the past couple of years) and I have vast experience of doing this with other themes . I'm not sure If I'm using the hyper-responsibility thing as an excuse to not feel so gulity. And when I don't feel guilty, I feel guilty about my lack of guilt.
A bit of info on my past- I have obsessively worried about my own short comings and suffered periods of depression since I was around 12- this is the first period of constant sadness and real low self worth that I can remember (I don't think I had much confidence before this age also). This has happended many times, and now I am in my mid 20's. I remember a period of being terrified of hurting a member of my family who I love more than anyone. It is only in the past year that my affliction has been diagnosed as OCD, since I have seen a therapist. My OCD ruminations went into overdrive a couple of years ago when a relationship ended. I would constantly think of all the things I did wrong, if I was abnormal and what was wrong with me, I would spend all day arguing against these negative thoughts. Not long after, my beloved dog of 17 years passed away.I feel like a complete hypocrite writing this as she deserved so, so much better.
The big 'hot topic' or theme- We got her (a Yorkshire Terrier) when I was around 7 or 8 years old and I always loved her very much. I was devastated when she died and still miss her. Throughout her life up until her being fairly old I would run around after her, tease and torment her (one incident I've been thinking of is a time when I flicked some playing cards in her face, I guess because I was bored and wanted to see what she would do or something). I would now and again chase her around with balloons because she was scared of them. Once I made it so she would hit/bump her head on a table because I suppose I thought it would be funny- it wasn't hard or anything and I dont think it would've hurt much really but I still hate myself for it, I flicked her ear a few times, would dress her up in dolls clothes. I would squeak her toys in her face to get her to play with me, I really hope it never hurt her ears but I guess I didn't really think about this or care about this at the time). I've tried to tell myself that loads of kids do stuff like that to their pets but I feel like I'm so evil for doing stuff like this.
Also when I was younger I would smack her probably on a daily basis(probably sometimes too hard I think) if she did something 'wrong' (like going to the toilet on the floor, or excessively barking at people through the window or at the gate), maybe I learned to do this as I saw my parents do it as a discipline technique. She would do something 'wrong', it wouldn't particularly bother me but sometimes I would choose to be the one to go and ''discipline' her by giving her a smack or shouting at her- I think I did it sometimes just to get out a bit of frustration, or to have a sense of be control I guess in a life where I didn't have much confidence and a lack of control. She always seemed submissive and would lower her head when you went to stroke her, she would assume sumissive body language (avoid eye contact, ears down etc) when you greeted her or went up to her. Even when she was being submissive I would still give her a smack when she did something perceived as 'wrong', again as a discipline thing- but she hadn't done anything particularly bad eg, barking through the window at people going past. Now I am older I now know that she was just being a dog and wasn't doing anything wrong. I cant live with myself that I caused her to be scared or unhappy for 17 years. I think that what I did was pretty bad and not many crimes would measure up in regards to the affect on another life.
I really really hope I am exaggerating the affect I had on my dog and I hope I by ruminating I am remembering it much worse than it was. I recall a time when I went to get her in from the porch where she was barking at passers by and I gave her a smack for barking, and my mum said """"""""she only gets her in so she can smack her"""""""". This memory makes me feel sick to my stomach. For my mum to say this I suppose I must've smacked her often for her to notice this.
She was a submissive dog, to think she lived in fear because of me makes me hate myself. I ruminate over what my dad said about the buglary at our home- that they must've kicked her or something- I think he must've noticed a difference in her afterwards (I was about 11 or 12 years old so can't really remember my dogs behaviour before the break in), I tell myself that if she was scared it was prob the burglary but I just go round and round eg- what if he can't remember clearly etc. I have spent so much time on the internet looking for info about submissive dogs and behaviour when I should be working. I worry that my boss will question me about this.
She would always be happy to see me when I got home, she'd be jumping around (although she did greet with submissive body language at first) and excited and she would run upstairs to sleep with me on my bed. I try to excuse my behaviour by telling myself that it was the break in that made her overly submissive but this just leads to more rumination.
I think around my later teens I matured and thought its cruel to do this sort of thing, I wouldn't smack her or particularly tease much. Maybe when I was younger I didn't realise it was wrong, I remember a few times someone or another would say 'aww you shouldn't do that its cruel' if I was chasing her around or teasing her. I didn't really take it in. I suppose I thought I'm loving her and don't think I'm hurting her. Also she didn't go for any where near enough walks, I suppose being young when we got her I didn't want to take on that responsibility and as I got older I just got used to it being that way. I've read that yorkshire terriers dont need much exercise and are happy to potter around the garden. I've been reading up on yorkshire terriers and dog behaviour to try to make myself feel better but I dont think I even deserve to feel better or have a clear conscience.
It sounds silly but I really did love her like a baby, I would come home from uni and couldnt wait to pick her up and stroke her and I hated leaving her when I had to go back to uni. She had to have an operation about a year before she passed away and I was so upset she might not make it, then when she did I stayed there with her and did what I could to make sure she was looked after and comfortable. I also keep thinking back to the time when we fist got her and she went for her vaccinations she let out a little squeal and for some reason I laughed. I dont know if I just thought it was a funny noise or something because I never liked to see her pain. Why would I laugh? I can only think that there is something quite wrong with me and I am not a nice person. Please tell me, how can I possibly make up for doing wrong to this innocent little soul? She is the happiest memories I have and I cant live with this guilt. To picture her little face makes me want to cry. To read about animal cruelty makes me so angry, so to think I did this- I don't know how to move past it or if I deserve to carry this around with me.

"Hi guys

I haven't been on here for a while. Ive just been trying to deal with stuff on my own and cbt but something happened that I need help with.

Yesterday I searched a particular adult star and found a porn site....watched a few vids....got bored of the same person so scrolled down the page. And what did I see??? CP thumb nails!!!!

As someone who has always suffered with POCD amongst other themes, I am distraught.

Anyway, to tell the rest of the story, I then looked.for aome different legal vids. ..found a adult one any finished the deed (sorry for details)
But I looked back at the thumbnails...I was not aroused. ...I dont think....and have no idea why I looked again! I NEVER clicked to watch these.
I kmow I panicked a Japanese vid I did try to watch was legal and checked it out and it was.

I reported the site, who apparently arent responsible for this thumbnails from other sites who advertise on theirs.

I'm freaked out. Why did I look again??? I even looked this morning...mainly to see where that Japanese vid came from. But saw more bad thumbnails.

I don't know what to do. Am I a pedo? I didnt ask to see this stuff. But why did I look again? I even wondered if I was turned on (well...I was from previous adult clips) but what if it was thumnails too.

Distraught. Didnt need this.

"Hi there,
I don't reckon I have contamination OCD, despite being originally diagnosed with it due to my dislike and fear of dirty things. I consider this dislike to be normal (who actually likes dirt?!), or maybe a tiny bit off normal compared to my housemates who are not diagnosed with OCD. However, my dislike for dirt stems from the fact that WHENEVER I touch something I perceive as being dirty, I get this horrible tingling feeling in the part of my body which it touched. I think it causes some anxiety, not as much as my actual OCD triggers, but that may be because it is such an awful feeling! It won't be neutralised by washing (I will wash, but not excessively as there's no point as a thorough wash should be enough and the tingling does not go!). I just have to wait for it to go, which takes some time. I can even forget about touching the dirty thing and STILL FEEL the tingling (and then I'd question why and remember).
Due to this, I do find myself in states where I'm afraid of contamination and hating when my housemates haven't been clean in the communal areas. I have explicitly told them that my OCD isn't contamination-orientated, so I can't use it as an excuse/reason...
Can anyone relate, or tell me why this happens? Is it normal? I HATE it! I see people touching dirty things and I'm all """"""""WHYYYY ARRUJHGJHGF!"""""""" .

A lot of what I hear is that rituals are performed to lessen the anxiety or bad thoughts, but isn't it also because the sufferer needs to make sure bad things won't happen?
I know my fears are irrational but I have to make sure they're irrational just in case, because me myself really doesn't want the fear to come true.

"Okay. i need to vent here, and i need some advice.
Its about girls, alcohol and just having a bad day to be fair.
Okay, It all started off a few weeks ago when my friend Jenny introduced me to her friend Jess. We got talking and realised we liked each other a bit, and said we would go to this club (Welly) on friday (yesterday). So i got really excited, and spent all my pocket money for 2 weeks just geting in, and transport / drinks. I was happy, and then Jenny and Jess walks up, and we started talking, Jess didn't say a thing so it was just like a conversation with Jenny.
Us three was sort of dancing, Jenny left, so there was me, Jess and her friends, who were basically laughing at me, and when i tried to talk to her she was busy with her friends, so i left her to it. I went outside for some fresh air a bit later and she was there so i went up again, and she just said hi, and i had to constantly ask the questions like """"""""How was your day?"""""""" then she just walked off. I saw her another time, and she ignored me again. So I decided she didn't like me anymore. And then Jenny introduced me to her friend Flourence, and we got talking, and then she made my night, we exchanged numbers and shizzle and then left.
Straight after welly, i went to a 6th form party, which was basically for everybody to get to know each other. There was alcohol there and i guess i had some, i was all ready to go home, when two 14 year old girls who are good friends of mine told me they were sleeping on the streets for the night. Now i don't know why, but i promised them i would stay with them to make sure they were safe. There was 6 of us altogether and we went for a walk, and one of the girls fell unconcious in a graveyard. So i put her in the recovery position, and she woke up again almost instantly, and fell asleep there, so we all stayed there, figuring it would just be best. At 4am we went for a 3 mile walk to keep us warm (i was just in basically shorts and a t-shirt without a jacket). We finally fell asleep at 5:15, and woke up at 5:45. We waited for the street lamps to go off, and then went and got some breakfast from a shop.
After a long walk home i got in at 7:37 and just fell asleep on the hallway floor, after waking up and getting a much awaited shower, i went to bed. I got a text at 11am from my best friend telling me i was late for her birthday party. I got straight on the next bus and came to the cinema and we saw the movie. I was shattered by the end of the day, and feeling really really emotional. I gets on MSN and Jenny comes online, so i said hey, and she told me to go away. Saying i upset Jess by ignoring her, i explained my story and she said to stop shifting the blame. I said she was ignoring me again, and she said Jess was playing hard to get. Feelnig REALY down at this point, we had a little argument. She said i was a retard, and accused me of looking down her top, being a stalker, a pedophile and a pervert. Just for the record, i didn't look down her top. And apparently its because of that, Jess was ignoring me because she felt inadequate. She called me a politics boy stalker"""""""" and i said how to have a relationship, you need to talk. She told me that because i was a virgin, i can't have a relationship. That hurt.
I've lost one of my closest friends
I've upset a girl
I've made a girl that liked me, hate me.
I cant get the tears out my eyes, and i've been sick a few times too. I need advice on what to do. How do i make up with Jenny? Should i meet Jess again, or go for florence? I cant think. I need any assistance here, because i feel worthless, inadequate, and so alone.
It's playing with my mind, its worse then washing my hands, and i just dont know what to do :'(

"Hi everyone..
Please bare with me. I know I've posted a lot in the past, and people may be frustrated with me over previous things I have said. Plainly, I understand if people think I am a freak who doesn't actually have OCD and just clogs this board up. But believe me I try to make myself better. I want honest opinions and advice on well.. life I guess. From people older, and perhaps a lot wiser than myself. If you could just spare me a few minutes to have a read and let me know what you think, Id be massively grateful.
The last week or so has been terrible to be honest. I'm back at uni, and I just feel empty.
I can't even explain how I feel. I just feel empty... completely hopeless when I look to the future. I honestly feel I don't have a future any more.
I'm back at uni and got no motivation, even though I should be leaving in a couple of months. I remember when I first started uni I used to really put all my effort into my world, I had ambitions, but now I just think they have all gone. I can't even bring myself to pick a book up, because I just get the feeling of 'whats the point?'.
It all stems from my private life. I don't even know if I have OCD. But basically, all this has ever revolved around is that I look inwards at my own behaviour and my past. I look at my sexual fantasies, how much porn I watched growing up or still do compared to others, what sort of porn I watch (Like, would others my age even search for different things?) and what 'turns me on' and what arouses me..
I have the whole attraction to kids thing too. I don't know where this came from. Over 2 years ago, I never noticed kids. Now, I am absolutely convinced I have formed an attraction. Weirdly, this doesn't bother me as much day to day and my other worries
I just feel like such a freak. There are things that arouse me that make me so ashamed its unreal. I feel I could never have another partner, because they could never accept the fact that I find a few weird things arousing, even though I hate feeling like this. But I have accepted that they do.. there is nothing I can do, I didn't choose to be born this way. But it is just plain weird. I can't imagine any of my mates ever being like me privately, or having anywhere near the same kind of habits. I makes me so ashamed and sad.
I do play things over in my head to wonder whether I have grown out of certain things. But I know that when your 16 or whatever, your sexuality becomes fixed and can't be changed. So I have to accept these weird things..
I guess I am comparing myself to others again. Like I said, I have accepted my failings. But they won't leave me alone, and they are trying to become a bigger part of my life than they really are. I have no interest in seeking these things out in porn or anything (illegal anyway) because I hate it anyway. But the fact remains that when I was a teenager at school, I saw this type of porn, and I got aroused back then and it still arouses me today.
I just wat to be normal like everyone else. I want to be able to work towards things and not live constantly thinking 'well, you can't achieve x because you have these weird things.. your life is over'
I know I should really just think 'ah well, I know its a bit weird, but you hate it, not my fault, live a normal life, and just work to watch less porn (I'm 21, nearly 22, I know people my age watch a lot of porn and are very sexually motivated, I just feel like I have always watched more than others and jut the fact that I search for particularly things that I find arousing is weird.. I cant imagine anyone else doing this, Id imagine others to just log on and click the first video they see.. which is pretty normal.. they arent that bothered about it) and leave this in your private life'. The fact is though, I feel as though this becoming more than my private life. Becuase I think about it all the time, and try and calm myself, and make myself feel okay, it is as if it is a bigger part of me. I can't sufficiently explain what I mean. It's not like it is a thing that I shoved away, and my life is consumed with important and honest things like my work, it is as if this is my life... and that is just weird.
I'd be more than happy talking about these things in private, and would even post them on here but for one, I dont want to offend anyone, and two I dont want to spike anyone. I'd love a friend to talk to about things, I simply have no one. 2 people know about my problems, and I no longer speak to either.
Sorry for the long post. I was doing so well with everything up until Christmas. Since then, I've just gone downhill.
Is this even OCD?

"Hi all,
I'm getting really worried about my ocd these days. It's getting totally out of control and I don't have a clue how to stop it. Everything I try to do just becomes another aspect of the ocd. If I do the rituals it's ocd, if I spend days worrying it's ocd, if I seek reassurance it's ocd, if I avoid things it's ocd, if I try to think my way out of it, it's ocd. I just feel like I'm batting my head against a brick wall trying to deal with this Every time a doubt comes into my head I just can't let it go. I immediately feel worked up and confused inside and I start to worry about what I should do. The doubt feels so real and every single time that the doubt comes into my mind I always take the cautionary route. I just feel that I don't do anything different from anyone else. If someone doubts something they check if they can. The only difference is that other people have self confidence and so can make quick decisions probably subconsciously that answer the doubts that pop into their minds. All the doubts that come into my mind are just too difficult for me to answer as the pressure, dread and worry kicks into overdrive. When I was a child I had a phobia of going in any sort of road transport (cars, buses, taxis) and after several chats with a psychologist (which I don't think did anything for me) she basically gave me an ultimatum: agree to expose myself to the fear or we were just wasting time. I think there was a bit of a guilt trip involved (I could be wrong though as it was at least 20 years ago and I can't remember much about it) and so I gave in and gradually started facing the fears. The thing that I feel was crucial though was the fact that the psychologist came with me on a bus and a taxi and was actually there in person helping me through the fear. The difference with the ocd is that (a) you are left alone to face (in my case) several different fears each one containing possibly hundreds of different triggers and (b) with my phobia I reckon I only felt anxious on the build-up to going in a bus for example and the time spent in the bus which I knew was a finite amount of time. Once I was out of the bus I can't think of any reason why the anxiety would have remained. With ocd, however, the anxiety builds up AFTER the exposure and there is no potential end in sight for the worrying. These two factors are real stumbling blocks for me and I'm really getting worried that unless I can make a breakthrough within the next month or so then I'll end up in a mental institution for the rest of my life. It's having a severely detrimental effect on my family and we're all at breaking point and I'm frequently at the stage of feeling that I'll totally crack if just one more thing goes wrong.
Sorry for the rant but I'm just so sick of this ruining my life.

"Hi there. I've been recently worried about thoughts that come to my head. I'm 24 and have had these kind of thoughts for years, but never paid attention to them. My thoughts are about hurting people. When I've been working as a nanny I've had thoughts about killing the child and cutting his body in pieces, I've imagined myself kissing a stranger guy when my boyfriend comes to see me, when I wake up by my boyfriend's side and I see him sleeping and so innocent, I imagine that if I wanted, I could kill him and he would not be able to protect himself. When I peel an avocado or something else, I look at the knife and I imagine and think -what would it happen if I stab myself?-.
When I was a child I used to go to bed with a story that I created myself. It was about 3 children that were beaten for their mother who was drugaddict and alcoholic. Then a good man knew about the children and adopted them. Sometimes the eldest sister behave like her mother did, and hit her younger brothers too. I went every day to bed with stories and pictures about abuse and mistreatment to children. (my parents were good with me, I don't know why I started to imagine such things).
I started to masturbate when I was only 5 or 6 years old. When I did it, I pictured in my mind the children of my story, being beaten. I made the link between physical abuse and sexual pleasure. When I masturbate now I don't think of the kids anymore, but I think of women being raped or beaten and I enjoy. I've asked my boyfriend I would like him to spank me too when we play.
My thoughts about hurting people disturb me, they come and go and I try not paying attention to them, but I hate them,,,I don't wanna hurt anyone, I don't want to cheat on my boyfriend, I don't want to have conflict thoughts with myself thinking I'm a horrible person for thinking such horrible things.
I don't have any mania such as washing my hands several times, but I've found that I read letters several times before I post them, I want to check they are ok. I do the same with text messages and once I've sent them, I check them again to see if what I sent was what I really meant. I've been always very obssesed with dates, I write down almost everything happens to me and I need to remember dates. For example I remember the birthdays of each member or my boyfriend's family, also his friends. I need to remember also the date and time I lost my virginity and the date and time I met my boyfriend.
I need my clothes to be put in an special way in my wardrobe,,,if someone changes this, I feel really unconfortable. I'm very protective towards my boyfriend, maybe it is a way to ease my thoughts of him being attacked,,I cannot help him
I'm scared of visiting a doctor, I don't want to be labelled and maybe it wil be difficult to find a job being diagnosed with a mental disorder. I don't know what to do,,,I even don't know if this is an illness or I just have a very active mind.

"Hey everyone,
Just thought I would come on here and let out some of my troubles as I am feeling pretty depressed and alone right now. Basically earlier on I was doing some of my OCD rituals and my Dad shouted at me ' I wish you would move out you ****** freak '. I have no idea what to do. I moved out earlier on in the year for six months but unfortunately due to lack of money I had to move back in with my family once the six months had expired. I hate being here as my Dad doesn't understand what I am going through whatsoever and he is very aggressive towards me. It has gotten so bad that we seriously haven't spoken properly for the past two to three years or so and I live in the same house as him! He doesn't make me feel welcome at all. I would move out in a second if I could but I don't have the money at the moment and my OCD has become so bad that I wouldn't be able to hold down a job. I feel so trapped and even my family call me a freak!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I hate my Dad for not trying to understand, he just thinks I'm ' losing my marbles '. I hate him so much. All he has ever done is put me down. I think about committing suicide all the time. I have tried to get help several times, especially when I moved out as I wanted a fresh start but it all got on top of me and I got worse on my own and the help I did receive was utterly useless, I felt no-one I was seeing really cared, and it seemed I knew more about my condition than them! I have totally given up. For the past six years since leaving my university course my life has been hell. My OCD has taken over every aspect of my life. I have no friends, I don't get out anymore, my family don't give a ****, I haven't been near anyone for about three years not even for a hug, I can't hold down a job as my endless rituals get in the way.. I mean, my days basically consist of doing my routines which as I'm sure you all know, must be done to perfection. I feel so tired. My Dad thinks I am lazy and that I sleep for ages, but I'm not! I am simply so exhausted from everything I have to do, my mind is just on overload all the time, I even have nightmares about OCD things now!! I honestly go to bed every night hoping that I don't wake up. I hate life. I have never enjoyed it. My cats were the only thing which kept me going but because of my OCD I can no longer go near them as in my mind they are now contaminated. I feel so alone. Finding this forum has helped but overall I still have this huge problem to deal with and all on my own. No-one cares what I'm going through. I've been thinking about going away on holiday and then ending it all recently as I just want to have some happiness in my life before deciding to end it for good. I am so fed up :o(
Sorry to ramble on but I needed to talk to someone.

"I am OCD regarding germs. I find it hard to use the toilet at home. Regular trips for a number 1 last me washing my hand for 30mins, with a set number of times (5) and pattern I have to follow. And then have to change my clothes right after. And when I go for a number 2, I have to make sure to have a shower right afterwards. But that lasts me 2 hours. I have to make sure to start at my head, wash it 5 times, and then I move down to my body, and I scrub each part 3 times, resoap, scrub 3 times and then resoap again and then scrub one last time. All throughout I cannot use my right hand as I touch the bottles with it which are 'dirty'. Then I have to turn the light off, wash my hands 5 times and then carefully get out making sure I don't touch anything. It's so frustrating and I now it's stupid but I cannot feel at ease and comfortable unless I do it throughly and properly. 
 I find it difficult to go near less developed areas because I've got some reason made up the decision they are dirty and everyone there is too. Some shops I cannot go in because I saw someone with some sort of skin disease shop in there and therefore cannot go in. I cannot touch certain things around the house. Cannot go into the living room. Not touch any walls. Shoes only in the house. There's so many rituals I have to do and so many more things that I cannot do to various irrational reasons. It's ruined my life. 
I am a 17 year old that's been suffering from OCD since I was 12. I remember my mum telling me to make sure to wash my hands after coming home from school on the bus or tube. That got ingrained in my head and I used to make sure to do it everytime, eventually getting to the point where I had to make sure to do it thrice everytime. Then I found out a kid in my class had eczema, which further worsened my hand washing and it got to the point where I would rinse my whole head and my arms aswell as hands everyday. The washing after going out has gone away now, but other rituals have come and taken over my life. 
What can I do? I am not officially diagnosed with it as I don't want to go to my local surgery as it's according to my brain filled with germs and is 'dirty'. Plus I don't really believe in the effectiveness of medicine and perceive them to be more of a money grab by the pharmaceutical companies. Do they genuinely work or are they placebos? Is there anything I could do to help me get my life right again.","['toilet', 'disease', 'living room', 'eczema', 'urge', 'OCD', 'Rituals']",['irrational'],"['urge', 'disease', 'OCD', 'living room', 'Rituals', 'toilet', 'irrational', 'eczema']",,1.0,,,
"Earlier today I had yet another spike. I saw this character on this show that I'm a huge fan of and there's this guy who's cool and looks rather handsome in a non-gay way. It was because of that, that I started to get that worried feeling again in my head when I see a guy who is perceived as handsome and during that worried state, my mind is always trying to wlead me to relate that to some sort of sexual thought. Well, that happened to me just now. What I did was that for a split second I imagined what it would be like if I kissed the guy just to see that I wouldn't like it. I do that all the time when I get worried like that. I tried to test myself and for a split second it felt to me as if I """"""""liked"""""""" it. It's probably just another OCD trick, but I'm once again feeling like I really """"""""liked"""""""" it and now once again I feel like I really am gay, but I know I can't be. I would never ever whether naturally or not, pursue a homosexual relationship. And when I think back on it, my mind keeps telling me that I'm gay and I can't get my brain to think otherwise.

"I've been suffering from such severe OCD for so long that I don't know how to handle it anymore. It seems like I've suffered from every type--medical, pure o, etc., and now I'm struggling with scrupulosity. It's literally killing me.
I've had scrupulosity for about as long as I can remember. I am a devout Christian, but I know I'm taking my worship too far. I don't know how to escape feeling like I've sinned and haven't repented, and my rituals always involve prayer. It's slightly more controlled when I'm around others, but when I find myself alone, I am always praying, and it drives me to the point that I start screaming and getting extremely angry. I walk around all day with my head feeling like it's full of fog. I feel like I'm just losing my will to live (I haven't thought about suicide, though). As a Christian, I want God to be a source of joy in my life, but my OCD makes everything about my faith seem dark and scary and just so bad. Even though I've had OCD for over a decade, I've never felt so bad or so defeated, and I just feel like a shadow of my former self. I just want to sleep and avoid my life. I spend hours every day ritualizing, even though I know it does no good.
I just feel so crazy, and sometimes I wonder if OCD can take over. What I mean is, sometimes I will have an unwanted sexual thought, and then I will feel like I really do like that thought, to the point that I am aroused and want to take care of it. This is all the while being so appalled that I could ever feel """"""""attraction"""""""" or whatever it is at something like that. I feel like everything I do is morally reprehensible.
I have stopped watching TV and reading books and accessing any material that might show me information that could trigger my OCD, especially my scrupulosity. If there are any Christian sufferers of OCD out there, how can I overcome this? I know we aren't supposed to ritualize, but what if I really am sinning, and I don't repent? I know God understands my heart, but what if that is not enough?
I'm also looking for advice outside of scrupulosity, though. I'm sick of worrying about stuff I have no control over or feeling """"""""attraction"""""""" for stuff I'm not attracted to. I'm sick of waking up feeling fresh and alert, only to be so bogged down by OCD an hour later that I just want to sleep. I used to be such an outgoing person, and now I feel like I'm nothing. And I can't afford a therapist or meet with anyone about this. The only person I have is my twin brother, who also suffers from OCD. Any help would be appreciated.","['Rituals', 'joy', 'outside', 'Thought', 'OCD']",[],"['outside', 'Thought', 'Rituals', 'joy', 'OCD']",,1.0,,,

I seem to have this whole theme now about liking things that are sick.

They forced her mouth open and fed her this horrid gruel/vomit looking stuff , and I keep trying to figure out if I found that sort of arousing? When i was like 11 or 12, maybe I had a few strange thoughts an this is what I making me wonder whether I have actually changed.
Last night also I remember having a dream about a young girl. I woke up fully aroused and everything. Yesterday was my first real day of ignoring kids and stuff again, I made a vow to just ignore them if I came across them in shops and whatever. But the arousal is just so intense and feels so real.
I really just feel like a freak. I look at my mates and they're all straight and true in what they believe and what they stand for.

"Something happened at work today and I'm really having a difficult time over it. It's really embarrassing too...
I usually wash my hands, multiple times, before I go to the loo (and after, of course). I know that washing before going to the loo is strange to some, but I have to work with computers, cables, floors, and other things that are contaminated (computer keyboards being one of the dirtiest things around).
Today, however, I didn't plan things well and I only managed to wash my hands quickly once before I had to pee. So, if washing my hands only once is not enough, I've contaminated my clothes with my hands.
This is really, really bothering me. I do a lot to not contaminate myself and spread things around further. I feel like I've failed today. Completely failed to protect myself and my loved ones. I don't want to bring this spooge home on my clothes.
I'm trying to get around the idea that washing my hands once - just once - is enough. I did manage to do that (however quickly). In August on my holiday I managed to do that a couple of times and feel okay but the circumstances were different. I was on holiday, not mucking around on keyboards and cables at work. And there are associations with where I live regarding certain people, places, things, etc., that I am terrified of.
For what it's worth, since being back from vacation I usually wash my hands 6 times before they feel clean. Even then, it has to be 6 good scrubs - at least 60 seconds each. Ugh. I hate this. Hate it, hate it, hate it...
Is washing hands once - just once - actually effective? Germs and chemicals?

"Hello everyone!
I have been having trouble with a certain topic and I’m not sure how to deal with it.
This Thursday me and some friends/co-workers are going out for dinner and partying after.
We made an agreement to go all-out with the liquor, and just see where we will strand. Now one the one hand im feeling really excited but on the other hand im very anxious because im afraid that I might lose control over myself and kiss another woman. I am happily married and don’t want other woman.
The reason for this OCD theme goes back a couple of years when I was not yet married, me and a friend were out and I made a mistake, I kissed another woman that night, which I did confessed to my wife but felt terrible about it afterwards even to the point I felt like such unworthy that I got suicidal because of this. (other OCD themes contributed to those thoughts aswell tho).
Since those years back ive been going out on several occasions and never did anything that would come close to that one time, I even try and evade most woman while going out now, I get nervous and anxious when they come close to me, look at me, or when I notice I feel attracted to them.
I turn away my head or walk away when they are to close or in my line of sight, I try and do everything in my power to prevent physical contact and vocal communication aswell.
But now I planned this night with good friends of me, and I cannot stop and feel anxious. I don’t want to cheat, I want my wife. But I also want to be able to go ‘loose’ with my friends just having a good time together for this one time and not be tempted to get close or talk to another woman.
PS: this theme does not only affect me during going out, im also very hesitant in my communications with other woman on work, street, and general in life except from my own wife, just because im afraid I might somehow give signals of interest or anything like that.","['Suicidal', 'Thought', 'interest', 'OCD']",['theme'],"['Suicidal', 'interest', 'Thought', 'theme', 'OCD']",1.0,,,,
"Hi, I'm new on here, and I hope people don't mind me posting this, but I feel down and anxious. My ocd is usually to do with tapping and numbers, and over the past few months it's to do with doing things like brushing my mum's carpet (she passed away a few years ago and i miss her, also my dad too) in certain ways until i feel ok that it's done properly. That's also to do with me thinking one of my friends will judge me if it's not done or he won't turn up then i'll miss him... I turn my phone off when i do this ritual, like i have to listen to the ocd. Other things include using a bottle of eye drops i had for an eye condition, but now the bottle is completely empty of drops and i still feel i have to do this. I have to change into my nightwear at a certain time at night, and I don't get to bed till after midnight because of the stupid rituals like making sure the lights are out by 10pm, I have to wash and run my hands under cold water after using the empty bottle, it's like the actual actions of doing things, i feel i have to do them, until i've got it 'just right'.
I feel anxious about throwing the empty eye bottle away, i'm wary of the anxiety, a few times i've put the bottle in different places (the main place was the fridge to keep the drops cool) but then i get it out again, i'm like this with the bottle and other rituals, so i can 'shut the ocd up' and feel better, and i found it easier to tolerate the anxiety when i saw my therapist, but i don't see him anymore as i have to give myself 6 months etc, although i hope to get help soon.
I know nothing will happen cos i've had 'proof' when i've forgotten to do a ritual, but i feel anxious when i think of stopping some rituals, or easing from things like tapping doors in my flat.

I must have turned that power switch on and off 6 or more times, maybe even 20, I have no idea...I became so obsessed with making sure that it was turned off and then afraid that I'd turned the switch the wrong way so my neurotic mind interfered and for 10 minutes I was in a frenzy that made me hold my breath and have a severe anxiety attack! I was practically in tears and I was in horror over what I was doing. But what really freaked me out and snapped me out of the attack was when I heard my mother call me from her bedroom down the hall and say, """"""""it's okay, the radio is turned off now, you can relax...don't worry about it."""""""" I turned off the switch and that was it. Somehow my mother's interrupt saved me from my ritual behavior.
My heart pounded and I realized that I was not alone and another person was aware of this insane behavior - my mom! When I talked with her about it, I was in tears, I felt just awful and so scared, stupid, raw naked, and alone. I felt like such a freak and I thought for sure she'd think I was crazy and would give me a hard time or something. She stunned me by being totally loving, supportive, and nurturing. She soothed and calmed me and helped me realize that I was not alone and I was suffering from OCD. Now, I'm 37. Ever since that day, while I still feel ridiculous and like I'm """"""""going crazy"""""""", I recognize that I'm suffering from something horrible and very real and I'm not a crazy person, but it's not very easy to tell this to just any mental health professional. Over the years, my OCD rituals seemed to get worse and I had some reasonable days and moments and some really bad ones. The more stressed and unnerved I felt, the worse the days were. I have various rituals that I won't list here for now, but they all interfere with my daily life and I often find myself feeling very scared and depressed, like I'll never be able to stop. Thank goodness there are those moments when I have an awareness of what I'm doing and I'm able to take a deep breath, count to 10 and stop myself. I just wish these moments could more frequent and I'd have less rituals. This is a very painful illness to have to suffer from and I pray and hope that I and other sufferers will find the peace and serenity to heal and get well. Fortunately, my husband understands what I'm going through and he's very supportive. He too suffers a bit. Sorry for this long post. Thank you for providing this forum and thank you for letting me share.
Many Blessings to all,

"Hi again,
I seem to be getting a lot better at the moment, with many different aspects of my OCD slowly being toned down. Today though, I discovered one area that still needs addressing, one that dates back to my own troubled childhood.
Today is my 25th birthday, and an old fear has resurfaced. I recently bought a new digital camera from the Comet website, the Samsung L730, it's really cool but... I feel as if I've damaged it after only having it for two weeks. Because, I've got finger marks on the lens.
I've been told by my family and my College facilitator that everything is alright, that it is still usable, and I have been able to use it. But, while my heart says it's fine... my brain doesn't! I feel, I've hardly put a foot wrong recently, but on Saturday I put it in my pocket, and was worried that the case it was in was getting mucky (which it wasn't) Then today, whilst checking for problems (something I feel I shouldn't do, but as for know, a different matter altogether...) I ACCIDENTALLY touched it with my finger joint! When pointing the lens to a light source (room light, or sunlight), I see a light mark. I now feel like a failure, never learning from past mistakes. When I was a kid, I accidentally broke a lot of things, but now grown up, I've hardly grown out of my clumsiness have I?
Since this disaster, I've taken a few pictures of my house, and also taken a picture of plain white paper to check for imperfections. The pictures don't look that bad at all. The only positive I can draw from this is that I handled my camera after going to the loo, and cleaning up dogs muck, and washing my hands after each! So, I know I had clean hands, but I just need to get back to feeling positive.
Another issue with this is cleaning the camera, as I feel reluctant to do so. I am now planning to find professional cleaners in future as it was because of cleaning my last camera's lens that it got damaged in the first place! Vicious circle or what?
I hope I can get over this, and keep on saying to myself: IT IS NOT THE END OF THE WORLD!!!! As personally, I feel that mistakes with cameras, digital or not, happen to everyone, so I'm not alone!
Thanks for everyone's help and support so far, much appreciated!

"Hi guys,
I had to take two extra courses as well as the 4 that everyone else is sitting this semester and I missed 3 exams last semester so I knew that this would be too much (6 exams in May, 3 exams in August, for just over half of my degree credits).
I knew I needed to take an interruption of studies but my parents couldn't afford it as I wouldn't get student loan when I came back as I've already had enough years at uni and am only entitled to one more year of loan (I'm on a 4 year course, due in 4th year in September but if I took interruption I'd be in 3rd again). I feel really upset and angry because my OCD is awful, I can't organize my thoughts, my notes and am doing so many rituals with my work that I can't do my exams. I might now get forced to take an ordinary degree because of it. I am actually really angry at my parents because if I'd made the decision myself I'd have taken an interruption of studies. I also keep thinking now that I could have applied to take an exam only year next year rather than to go back full-time and pay for it. This is making my OCD worse How do other people deal with anger? xx","['Thought', 'Rituals', 'anger', 'OCD']",[],"['anger', 'Thought', 'Rituals', 'OCD']",,1.0,,,
"Feel utterly, utterly horrible at the minute guys. Before you read, you may find this disturbing just to let you know, but i need to talk and would appreciate your advice.
Basically, I was diagnosed with pure O a few months ago because of these disgusting feelings that I was going to harm the people closest to me. I felt absolutely terrible, went to get help and I'm waiting on my CBT appointment.
I only realised I had this recently, even though I went through a similar spike a few years ago, that time about my sexuality, (just after I realised I was in love with my girlfriend). I went to see a doctor that time round who told me it was obsessive ruminations and taught me some ways to deal with it. Obviously, however, the fear that I'm going to harm the people i love is much more distressing than the last one, as soon as my mind focuses on it i just get the most horrible knots in my stomach, feel debilitated but terrified this is me 'turning' or going crazy or something. i need to point out that I understand I don't want to do these things, they make me feel ill and my life has been hell the past two months, but this OCD can always twist things.
Today though, I was feeling good at the prospect of seeing my girlfriend next weekend, and then all of a sudden i started second guessing everything, felt the need to search into my past and to clarify that i'm not a bad person and it's spiralled out of control.
For some reason my mind is telling me that I engaged in a sex act when i was 5 with a girl the same age. I remember the girl, and i can kind of remember the event, it was curiosity and was on both our parts, wasn't like there was coercion or anything. i think it was just some kissing and exploring. but now i'm convinced this is my psycopathic nature starting itself. it's making me feel sick.
I also remembered a time when i was around 11 when i was browsing the internet and came across this website about people who had incestuous relationships. from what i remember they were saying how they liked these acts, and whilst i was absolutely not aroused by these things in any way, i was compelled to read them. i've always had a healthy relationship with my parents, and thankfully have never had inappropriate thoughts about them or anyone else in my family. but i'm terrified that this is completely inappropriate behaviour and indicative of the horrible person i am. i also think i must say i am not a sexual deviant in any way, i'm really pretty conservative when it comes to that stuff and am satisfied with that.
I'm so sorry for posting this, I feel absolutely lost at the minute, it's like as soon as i start making progress with this ocd something is thrown back in my face which just confirms the fears i'm having at the minute. I am a very sensitive person and always have been, I do not want to feel this way any more, and i know i shouldn't seek reassurance but tonight's revelations have really scared me, i've been compulsively looking at child sexual behaviour websites for reassurance, but i'm worried that the thing i did with this girl isn't normal and it's making me sick.
can someone please reply with what their thoughts are. i'm really sorry for the length, but just writing this has made me calm down a bit.

"Three weeks ago I was diagnosed with OCD.since then I have been struggling to cope.My son is waiting on psychologist appointment to begin CBT .Meanwhile CPN is going to start doing avoidance work with him.She forewarned me that WE will be in for a bumpy ride.
When I spoke to my son about this he was anxious and panicky said that he didnt think that he had ocd as he had horrible thoughts and visions and perhaps he was schizophrenic.I told him that OCD could take this form and it was not all about rituals.I explained that I had horrible thoughts and images but didnt elaborate on it as didnt want to give him my worries.
Now Im filled with guilt and anxiety +++Im not doing too well blocking out horrible visions and thoughts.Even though I recognise them as OCD symptoms part of me feels disgusted that I could ever think these things in first place.
People describe me as gentle natured and caring person and I feel a fake.I isolate myself from people outside of home as worry I will say or do something offensive.
I dont want to say what my images are as I realise that it would upset people.Im on prozac 20mg daily and although its lessened anxiety I still get the thoughts and visions that play out like a sick movie in my mind thats stuck in a loop and only briefly stops now and again.I know Im worried about my son and the anxiety will be high until Tuesday when CPN visits and trys her technique with him.ANY COPING STRATEGIES would be greatly appreciated.","['Rituals', 'guilt', 'symptom', 'disgust', 'outside', 'anxiety', 'anxiety', 'OCD', 'Thought']",[],"['outside', 'anxiety', 'disgust', 'Thought', 'Rituals', 'symptom', 'OCD', 'guilt']",,1.0,,,
"Can anyone relate to feeling like they were different for a second or two?
During OCD thoughts I felt not my usual panic, I felt like """"""""I could just do that now?"""""""" """"""""its that easy?"""""""" 
(mine is about speaking an OCD thought outloud under my breath,thus being doomed as it's religion themed)
I didn't want to act but I felt this numbness like I could have? But I think this was because I KNEW inside I wouldnt as I had no desire to.
But then I felt like I was so close, my OCD safe self returned to perform a checking behavior (pheeww I didn't mess up)
But then after that when I stopped focusing I felt like I accidentally did something.
(ie - felt breath push out ever so slowly with a kind of sound and I freaked out like I had acted on it)
I feel like I had the chance to be 'safe' but ended up getting lost in the moment, knowing in one part it was irrational, I could see it could make something out of literally nothing so easily, but then I fell for that very trick. I feel constant guilt that I acted in a way that would test myself and I failed. I feel like I saw danger and felt like I moved towards it before panicking. 
Please can someone relate?
I feel like I turned evil for a moment.
And now I'm left with guilt, Shame, frustration and self loathing.
I am so sad and I keep posting the same thing over and over, I know. I'm hoping to put a stop to this.

"For the last few years I've been washing my hands so much that I have used two packets of liquid handwash every day. This has cost £14 each week and it's also possible that some of the ingredients are harmful when used in such huge quantities. So I went cold turkey this week (I'm still using bar soap but less of it) and I'm really glad that I've actually made some progress!
Also I went into town for the first time in a couple of years yesterday because I'm not willing to let the OCD and social anxiety control my life any longer.

"Ok so I have OCD and my fear is contamintation from """"""""whatever"""""""" I am afraid at the moment. I have been receiving CBT for the last 3 months and I have made some progress and seen a few victories but mostly slow going.
Yes I give up, I give up trying to make this ocd work, I give up trying to sanitize the world so I can feel more comfortable, I give up thinking """"""""well next time I'll use a bag over top of the glove just in case there is a hole in the glove, ...then I will be safe!"""""""" I give up endlessly running over in my mind things that happened in the past trying to disect them and analyze all my actions to see if there was some better way of doing that. I give up all of this doubt about everything and if only I could be sure about this one thing...then I would feel ok about everything.
And why have I come to this conclusion about my ocd? because it can't be done, there is no way to fullfill my need to absolutely certain about everything once into the spiral it is a bottomless pit of horror where anything could be life threatening, my world is terrifying. But what brought me to this conclusion is I have had the house to myself the last few days and I thought it would be a nice quiet stretch and with no one but me home then I should be able to control my environment better because it would only be me and I am very carefull about what touches what. Well just like ocd always is everytime you think one thing it will be the opposite. The last few days have been terrible, I have spent the whole time cleaning and washing laundry (I think my washing machine is going to give up) and the worst part is the house is a mess, it looks way worse than it did a few days ago. I also have no peace of mind I am constantly doubting something. I wash my hands 6-10 times an hour (add that up throughtout the day) as a result my hands are covered in little splits and cuts and are very painful when I wash them. This is not new for me however. I was out at the store yesterday and reached into my pocket to take some money out and noticed my hand was bleeding, this happens from time to time but earlier I had some fears about touching an item on that same hand and now it has a open wound. I stared down at my hand in terror as I tried to think of what to do standing there as the store employee waited for me to do anything and I realized there was nothing I could do, that what ever happened had already happened but I knew then I had to stop washing my hands so much. Something like this happens to me all the time but the difference here is I realize even when everything is the way you want it, nothing is any better in fact it's worse.
So I give up and I accept there will be uncertainties in life, and some bad things will happen and some of them I could have been prevented if I did some sort of preventive measure and that is just life. In time, not right now, I will come to terms with this and I assume I will feel good about this. Right now I just know that as long I hold on to some bellief that I can manipulate the outcome of the future by doing some little task I will spend the rest of my life alone doing these little tasks and afraid of whatever the next new fear of the moment is.

"Well going back on my other thread about my incident with my friend about buying a mobile phone off him.On Sunday the 25th of January he sent me another text message about the mobile phone he wanted to sell to me whicxh I told him that day I wasn't going to buy it.I hadn't responded to him& I went to my local pub which I thought maybe he'll come there,I saw this other guy there who is a friend of his there& a friend of mine&I asked him has that guy messaged you today he said no which I believed him.When I was at the pub I saw this other guy which is a friend of the my friend who was wanting to sell me the phone I was getting anxious already I should've just left the pub I know.
I thought that guy would turn up& he did he saw me in the male toilets& said hello to me&started immediately about the phone& why I didn't answer him? I told him I didn't want the phone because I couldn't afford it so I would just fix mine& told him a number of occasions how much was he wanting for the phone&He didn't tell me until the day he saw me as he wanted to talk to me about it.He said to me I didn't tell him I had a limit of what I could spend so he just got whatever phone he could get his hands on first in his own words.He then went on to accuse me of taking off people&using my friends which I clearly never do& always try to pay my way& he clearly was wanting to start a fight with me.This guy that I know steals from places supermarkets anywhere he can really,he's told me he does it& after he's done it he's come up to me&Has told me I just stole this.
Anyway in the toilet he then came up to me up close&pushed me so I didn't really react to him,after we wnt back out into the pub he came up to me&he's quite a large guy without being offensive he came up to me without warning&gave me a big massive push to make me fall down into a table I didn't get hurt I got back up but I thought he's not worth attacking back as I thought this is what type of person he likely is.Later on he sat down at a table& had a beer in his hand with his leg on the table&he was continuing to try and get me worked up I had a fleeting thought to attackin him just like he did to me but I thought better not so I let it go.I had a couple of other words with him&then I left& he texted me a couple of times on my phone to try&be smart I texted back to him I know I should've just let him go.I've been trying hard to think about how far I've come&all my improvements,but when something like this happens it turns everything upside down&as much as I feel I try to stay calm it really distresses me so much.
I was pretty anxious&worked up I had all these thoughts going through my head,the ruminations about everything got very severe they went away which I was able to do&Then I got back into them again which I felt bad really to myself that I've let myself get bad with the ruminations again? I should've just let it go? I should've tried to maybe talk to him properly which I've taken a fair bit of blame about in a way.I've been having a fair bit of magical thinking which has happened at these magical such times of the day for e.g at a certain time I've looked at my phone& said to myself ok from now I'm not going to ruminate over this anymore.It reminds me so much of my past when I would do this so much& I hadn't done this for such a while which has got me worried If I'm falling back to old habits?.
On that day in question there were a couple of other friends of mine there that day sitting at a table which I haven't really know long but have come a bit close with recently.They didn't say anything while this was happening which I sort of understand maybe thinking not to get involved,after the incident one of my frinds sent me a text message saying He's sorry he didn't know that guy was coming&if I was alright?.I'm still a bit shaken up my moods have been swinging so badly I think much has been about this incident perhaps? I see my Dr again this Thursday I was thinking about talking to him or not about it?.I've been having some mixed feelings I've also been having some strong suicidal thoughts again,I've just thought I don't want to associate with this guy anyway anymore&a couple of the others which I haven't known for long also&just continue on with the others close in my life&my life which may be best for me?.I was wondering if any of you guys can please talk to me about this? Thank very much :original: .

Two years ago we were at a garden party at his friends house. Being 20 years old we are all about rawdy. His friends sisters were playing in the garden and they were 8 and 10. My bf and his friend played ball with them which was so cute!
Now my BF got really drunk that night and I also got tipsey. Later on that night my bf and his friends were calling my name, and I look at him and he has his dick sticking out and they are all laughing. I laughed too until I remembered what if the kids see? I told him to put it back in and he did.
My boyfriend and his friends always take out there dicks and do silly things when they party together. This was no different. I reacted as I have pocd.
Thing is....I dont remember if the kids were around when my bf did it, I dont know if they saw his dick. My boyfriend said that the kids went in an hour before he did the dick thing as he remembers, but I am unsure.
Anyways my ocd says dump him he is a bad person. He showed his dick when kids could have seen. My bf said he didnt even think about the kids when he did it, it didnt cross his mind.My ocd is tearing me apart. He is a bad person, he did something bad. Dump him.
BUT I LOVE HIM WITH ALL MY HEART! And I tell myself he didnt do anything bad. Ive talked to a friend on here about it and he agreed I was blowing this way out. And that it was a harmless prank. I even wrote in to people that deal with mentall illness and they said the same thing, too look at the situasion as a drunken joke and nothing more.
What did I do? I wanted more answers...and I put my question out on yahoo answers....
I got one person saying my bf is weird and another person saying that my bf didnt do anything but u have to be careful whipping this out. THAT SPIKED ME.
My boyfriend is loving and caring and he is sooo perfect. I love him. I dont want to think he did bad. My ocd says he is bad for not concidering that the kids ould have seen. But my bf promised me that he WOULD NEVER HAVE DONE IT IF HE KNEW THE KIDS WERE THERE.

He is amazing.I do talk to him about some ocd things. He understands ocd alot. I would be scared to talk about things, but he is so understanding.


I told him I felt I hugged my friends child to get a sexual feeling.U see I know that when I am around kids I will get a feeling in my vag.Not because I am pedo! But because whn my ocd spikesI will automatically get the feeling in my vagina. Its a nice feeling Small but simple. I then thought if I get these feelings from kids when I spike, I want to be around kids to spike my ocd to get that sexual feeling it gives me.

So when I hugged my friends child, I did so because I wanted to spike my ocd to get that nice feeling.I told my bf and he said: Darling I do not believe you used a child to get a feeling. But If you did, I would forgive you. I dont like you doing it, but if you feel better to know if it happend you did, I would forgive u. my boyfriend replied saying: Baby..what am I forgiving u for? U didnt harm the child. U hugged the child.

I also told him that i felt i have stopped on purpose or bent down on purpose for kids to bump into me soI can get nice feeling in my vagina.My bf said the same thing,he doesnt believe I have done it but if I had he would forgive me as the child is not harmed.All the child did was bump into me.

He doesnt see these as sexual acts and says there is always forgivness.He does not think I am a pedophile and he would not forgive me for pedophile actions.

Can someone tell me why my brain says my bf is a bad person that I need to leave him as he has forgiven bad things? My bf is the best support I have ever had and understands ocd.He said these things before he knew about reasurrence.

Having a forgiving bf is a wonderful thing,and he isnt forgiving a ***** or me ******* a kid.That a different thing.

"After some thinking I have decided to stay, thats if any of you will still talk to me.
I think i exspect too much from the board or maybe i don't know what i exspect or maybe i just want constant reassurance i don't even know myself sometimes. I think maybe i just need support and understanding and you people are very good at giving that.
The thoughts i explainned the other day regarding furniture items etc i think i may of explainned in a way which could of been seen as non OCD symptons. What i really ment is what if furniture can hear/see me and therefore i have to carry out rituals to reduce my anxiety but i can see that this process is abnormal.
I have decided to have a good talk with my physchiatrist next week and tell him everything so he can confirm that my thoughts are just OCD so i know what i am dealing with here. I do really 100% want to get better its been 16 years and i am prepared to suffer the anxiety involved with CBT if it means living a normal life in the long term.
As for today, i bought some things and the urge to take them back is unbearable. I am trying to challenge my thoughts but i am getting very upset over the whole thing because its so hard and i am so frightened
But i know that this is what i have to go through to get to the other side although right now it feels like agoney and i see no light and the end of the tunnel.
I hope i haven't offended any of you and Legand no hard feelings?

I have had palpitations for years, probably since i was about 8 if im honest, and have always put them down to anxiety, but i have always been scared of them, and they are what started off my ocd and anxiety when i was very young. i didnt go on rollercoasters and fast rides at theme parks, becuase i saw the sign that said """"""""dont use if you have heart problems"""""""" and i always thought i had, so didnt go on any.
anyway as old users of this board know i have always been worried about them, and ive had quite a lot recently, so i plucked up all my courage and went and saw the doctor. my ecg was normal, but it only was on for 12 seconds and i didnt have any palpitations when it was on. So i went back to the doctor yesterday, and im having 24 hour one done to pick them up, and also lots of blood tests on thursday. they are doing bon profiles and cardiac enzymes and liver and thyroid tests, and im so scared.
im scared i have liver disease (i did used to drink a lot, no alcholic states but every day) and im scared they are going to find something like cancer.
the doctor said they are benign palpitations bcos i havent collappsed or anything, but im so scared that something is very wrong with me and im going to die. i have a new baby and im so scared, i have faced up to my biggest fear and the cause of all my ocd and health anxiety, but now i have i feel so scared and exposed.

"Hi everyone,
I have just had 4 months off work and have just gone back on a part time basis.
I suffer from contamination OCD. Previously I would go home from work and have a bath immediately before touching anything at home. I never brought anything from home to work or vice versa. One of my major problems previously was that I did not know how to wipe myself properly after going to the toilet and I also did not know how to clean my hands. As a result, I had completely contaminated the whole workplace, especially my chair.
I have now been back at work for three days and I have not done any of the rituals that I used to do when coming home.
I still get many thoughts but I feel less anxious.
One of the problems is that my OLD workchair is still in the office and has now been put side by side to me. I had contimanated the chair with urine, faeces, sperm tissue flakes from wiping too much when going to the toilet.
I have managed to dismiss many other things around the workplace, but the chair is pretty tough. I accidentally touched the chair with my chair.
What should I do guys?. I have so far had a hard but good 3 days of exposure with hardly any rituals. The chair however is there reminding me off all the problems that I went through before I went away. Now I have touched it with my chair. It is an item next to me that I am avoiding to touch, but now my chair has touched it my anxiety is spiking.
Need some advice..","['OCD', 'Thought', 'office', 'anxiety', 'anxiety', 'toilet', 'Rituals']",[],"['anxiety', 'office', 'Thought', 'Rituals', 'toilet', 'OCD']",,1.0,,,
"I only found this website a few days ago and have realised that certain problems are related to my OCD. I have suffered from OCD all my life and also have had Compulsive skin picking for years, but am only starting to learn about both disorders and how bad they're really affecting me.
But, i also am wondering whether i have BDD, i know i have OCD (i have obsessive rituals but also obsessed about boyfriends past) but also i'm always obsessed that i'm not attractive enough. Ever. and i always think that my boyfriend is interested in other women and looking at other women (altho he assures me he isn't), and i hate it when there are attractive women on tv or in magazines because i don't like him looking at them. I suppose it's coz i think he's going to find them more attravtive than me. This leads to such jealous outbursts, and i can never relax as i'm constantly thinking that a more attractive women will appear when we're watching a film/walking down the street/reading a magazine.. etc.. or if he goes certain places i'll ask if there were any women there, how many, what they looked like.. i just have to know this information, i can't let it go..
Is this BDD? Or just OCD? Or just me being a JEALOUS BITCH??
I'm so messed up and confused. Last night i took a razor to my wrists.. couldn't do it tho. but then felt ashamed that i wasn't brave enough to do so.. this was because me and my boyfriend were having a really good evening and then we started argueing because something went wrong during sex and everytime it does i'm convinced it's because i'm not good enough or not attractive enough for him so he doesn't get turned on enough.. he says it's because of my reaction (i get so upset, and cry etc if things go wrong) that he gets scared of me and when he gets scared that means he can't do it.. and then things go wrong..
i need to talk so please anyone with some advice etc please reply..","['site', 'Rituals', 'interest', 'shame', 'OCD']",['obsessive'],"['obsessive', 'site', 'interest', 'Rituals', 'shame', 'OCD']",,1.0,,,
"Hi all - hope you are all ok.
The last 10 days have been good for me, felt i have been getting control of my life back a little. Had a trigger moment on Wednesday, but have not redone anything to """""""" make the feeling go away"""""""". Its so silly, but i bought a cake on Wednesday afternoon after a visit for work. Now its highly unlikely i will go to this cake shop again, but when i got back to my car and turned my engine on the first thing i saw was a 13. Since then i have been a little worried but have told myself;
People will buy things/see people they will never see again and then see a 13. This maybe an unlucky number but the majority of people will not go back and buy this thing or see that person again. They will carry on as normal. If i did go back and see this person than it would be OCD.
I have never had an issue with buying cakes before, so why start now. If i drive back to harrow to buy a cake just to avoid a number 13 that is OCD. I can see numbers at any time regardless of what i have just done.
When my OCD was at the highest i researched many forms of superstiion on the internet. Not one stated anything about seeing numbers or doing unlucky things ( walking under a ladder for example ) after the last time of doing something would mean you would be unlucky for ever!! yes 13 maybe an unlucky number but i could see a black and white cat cross my path later ( which is regarded as lucky ) tonight. None of it has any relevance to an event i may have done eaarlier in the day.
Its as simple as this, if i drive back to get this cake i will be giving in to OCD and at present i am not prepared to start OCD rituals over this. I saw a 13 - so what! I can see numbers at any time.
Hopefully the anxinous will soon subside

"Hello everybody,
My name is Coon (nickname), I am from Katy, Texas. I am 27 years old and I have been affected (if that is the right word) with OCD since a very young age. I won't go into detail much about my younger actions, I am hoping to get some answers on my current state with OCD. I would say I live a pretty happy life. I have a great wife, a good (stressful) job, a great dog, and plenty of friends. I enjoy fishing, hunting, and various other hobbies that I seem to jump to for a couple months and then move on from. I am not very educated on OCD or therapy for it (During registration for the forum they asked me what the T in CBT stands for, to prove I'm not a spam bot, and I had to google it). I have been OCD as long as I can remember. When I was very young it was things like flipping the light three times, looking on one side of the door then the other and then back to the other when I walked through a doorway, and stuff like that. When I was about 19 there was a few times where I would stay up so late doing rituals and I would get very irritated and angry, so I decided to get help. The Doc wasn't much help (or maybe I wasn't really ready to help myself) but he did prescribe me Zoloft. It is now 8 ears later and this is my predicament. Every moment it seems, I have to be doing something. It is always in 3's 9's or 27 and a new thing I do which started with 30 and 90 but is now 31 and 91 (I think the one is just to make sure I really counted to 30 or 90). Here are some examples, I will try to order them by what I do most to what I do the least.
1. I pop the joint on my index finger on my right hand (no with the use of the other hand, just by moving my finger, I don't really know how to explain it any better) and then press my thump and index finger together and move my thump from the tip of the finger nail to the top of the nail and then back to the tip of the finger nail, and then the reverse, from the top of nail to the end of finger nail back to the top of the nail, and then reverse again, tip of fingernail to top of nail to tip of fingernail, then I pop my finger again and do the entire pattern backwards - top of nail, fingernail, top then fingernail, top, fingernail, then top, fingernail, top, and then I pop my finger again. And then I do the original pattern again (the way I did it the first time). I do this, it seems like all the time, I don't feel any stress or anxiety or guilt (that I would think would trigger this) most of the time, but when something exciting is about to happen or I start listening to one of my favorite songs it really gets going.
2. Whenever I am grilling or cooking pasta or something, or filling up a cup with water, I have to count to 31 (before the water overflows) or when I know something im grilling is ready to be flipped I usually count to 91. Sometimes I count each number, sometimes I count to ten and hold up one finger then to ten again and hold up another until I have 3 or 9 fingers up and then I count to 1. Again this happens when I am not stressed out or anxious (that I can tell).
3. I pop my toes similar to the fingers except it is pop then rub the tip of my toe on the bottom of my shoe then pop again, then reverse, toe on bottom of shoe, pop, toe on bottom of shoe, and the original again.
4. As I am typing I realize it would take me forever to explain everything I do, but those are some examples. They are constant (it seems) but they don't really bother much (until today) and I don't really ever feel anxious like I use to.
My question is, Is this normal for OCD? To constantly do patterns even with seemingly no triggers.
I still sometimes feel that I have to do certain things or something bad will happen. Or a though will pop into my head and I have to do patterns to make sure that it wont come true. I often say to my self """"""""If I don't do this (the right amount of times) I will get fired, or my boat will break down (for no reason).
My other question is a little problem I have been struggling with for a couple of years now. I am addicted to craigslist. I see something cool and I do some research on it, and I fantasize how fun it would be and what I could do with it, and then I search for days to weeks on craigslist until I find a good deal and I buy it.
This is working well however because when I get bored with it 95% of the time I make anywhere from $300 to $2000 when I resell it. However my wife is quite upset with me. She always asked, """"""""when are you going to stop, you are always on your phone (on craigslist), and you are constantly obsessing over something.""""""""
In the Past two years I have
1. Proposed
2. Bought 2 New Trucks
3. Bought a House
4. Got married
5. Got a Dog (an offspring of a Hall of Fame retriever)
then on craigslist to continue the list in order
6. Bought a UTV (a 2004 Polaris Ranger, which is like a four wheeler and a car mixed together)
7. Sold the UTV and bought another better one with a trailer
8. Sold that Paid some bills and bough a lifted up golf cart
9. Sold that and immediately bough a better golf cart
10. Sold that, paid some bills and bought another cheaper golf cart.
11. Traded that for a racing four wheeler.
12. Traded that and a little cash for a street/sport bike.
13. sold the sport bike
14. Bough a bunch of high quality guns (baretta over under, colt pistols, ect)
15. sold those and bout a nice newer street bike
16. sold the street bike and built, by myself with some help of friends, an outdoor kitchen/extended patio and flower beds in my backyard. (which took weeks and late noisy nights which I'm sure made the neighbors upset) But it turned out beautiful.
17. Got a loan, since I cant sell the outdoor kitchen, and put $5,000 in performance upgrades in my truck.
18. Got another loan, since I don't want to sell the truck, and bought a nicer newer street/sport bike.
19. Sold the bike and now I have a 22 foot bay boat.
Is there a disorder for this? LOL. This is somewhat new to me, I never have really obsessed on material things before. I feel like I am doing it because I want to live life to the fullest and enjoy it as much as I can but my wife seems to think that it is unhealthy behavior. I have been told by my doctor that I am bipolar, but I never really get depressed. I was diagnosed ADD growing up and took Ritalin in elementary school. My current doctor says I am bipolar (I think mainly because of my legal problems from when I was 16-18 in which I got arrested around 9 times for various drug and alcohol related crimes, and promiscuity from 17-20), ocd, adhd, and I think I may be narcoleptic (I am exhausted and fall asleep inappropriately when I am not taking Adderall). I no longer drink or use illegal drugs, and I haven't for a long time. I do smoke cigarettes. Sorry for the long post. Can anybody relate to any of this?","['Rituals', 'anxiety', 'anxiety', 'guilt', 'anger', 'quality', 'behavior', 'fall', 'joy', 'kitchen', 'OCD']",[],"['quality', 'anxiety', 'kitchen', 'anger', 'fall', 'Rituals', 'joy', 'behavior', 'OCD', 'guilt']",,1.0,,,
"Hi All,
First of all I know the obvious answer is to go see a doctor to see if I have OCD or not but I am hoping people can give some general input or possibly point me in the right direction. Here are the things I suffer from that are common to OCD:
- Fear of making a mistake (for example when I make major purchases I often change my mind many times and always second guess and go back and forth even after the purchase)
- Fear of being embarrassed or behaving in a socially unacceptable manner.
- Excessive doubt and the need for constant reassurance.
- Fear of thinking evil or sinful thoughts.
- Being stuck on words, images or thoughts, usually disturbing, that won't go away and can interfere with sleep.
- Repeating specific words, phrases, or prayers.
I do all of these often however I don't have any problem with the way things are arranged, dirt, germs etc....

"I have the best thing in my life. A boyfriend that stands by me and helps me through pocd,rocd,harm o and hocd.
He helps me through depression and through my tough past. He is amazing.
I do talk to him about some ocd things. He understands ocd alot. I would be scared to talk about things, but he is so understanding.
But it all backfired on me yesterday.
I told him I felt I hugged my friends child to get a sexual feeling.U see I know that when I am around kids I will get a feeling in my vag.Not because I am pedo! But because my ocd will spike and I will automatically get the feeling. Its a nice feeling Small but simple. I then thought if I get these feelings from kids when I spike, I want to be around them to get the feelings so I spike.
So when I hugged my friends child, I did so because I wanted to spike my ocd to get that nice feeling.
I told my bf and he said: Darling I do not believe you used a child to get a feeling. But If you did, I would forgive you. I dont like you doing it, but if you feel better to know if it happend you did, I would forgive u.
I was so happy, but after 10 min....my thhoughts told me he is bad because he forgave such an evil thing. He should leave me not forgive me. I used a child.

"Hello there. My name is Meccasa. I am 18, going to college soon, and I live in the U.S.
My reason for joining this forum was to figure out if I really do have this issue or not. Now, I'm pretty sure I do, as it gives my life utter hell.
It's been happening from around when I was little. I couldn't give anything away to others, and I always used to get worried when I had to part with things. Nowadays, I've been getting better, but it's still hard. I cannot touch doorknobs without either using a napkin, or washing my hands after, as then weirdly enough my hands start to burn, not literally, but more like my hand's been contaminated, and I need to wash it now. Other than that, for a while I was okay, and I wasn't bothered much.
Lately, it has gotten worse. It started with the eyes, and everytime in my mind, I would see my eyes being slashed, cut, with anything in the most gruesome manner. It has been utter hell, as whenever I try to make it go away, it doesnt. Every time, I'd see my eyes being slashed out, with paper especially, and so, it would hurt badly, enough to make me feel suicidal and depressed. It happened nearly 24/7 one week, and it was utter hell. I'm an artist, so everytime I'd get paper to draw, I would mentally see my eyes being slashed out. And, not to mention, there were other things besides this that are still plaguing me to this day. I am terrified to go to social functions, because I am afraid that I will go crazy at one of them...not crazy in the loose my sanity sense, but in the """"""""throwing things around, hurting people, and injuring others"""""""" kind of crazy. (This is why I try to avoid social functions if I can.) When I did tell my parents about this, though, they just laughed it off, and said, """"""""everyone has little quirks..."""""""" Bu if this is a little quirk, then I dont want it! They can have it if they think it's a little quirk...
Anyway, I'm rambling on. The point of me introducing myself is because I've been fearing for years that this is what I have. I've done research on this for years, and it all points back to this. I'm not rich enough to afford a therapist, or a psychologist, so even if I wanted to make sure, I couldn't get diagnosed formally. So I'm turning here. Many of you guys may struggle with this, and I want to know if this sounds like OCD...or if it could be more serious than that? I've never had any reason to fake something like this, and this is utter hell to live with on a daily basis. If it does sound like OCD...well, at least I'll be slightly relieved to know that I was right when I realized there was something wrong with me all along, and that it's not some murderous, hellish thing that I have because of any X reason. And I'll be slightly relieved to know that I'm not accidentally appropriating a real mental disorder as I try to describe what goes on inside of my head.","['washing hands', 'Suicidal', 'fear', 'mental disorder', 'OCD']",[],"['Suicidal', 'washing hands', 'mental disorder', 'fear', 'OCD']",,1.0,,,

I know this might not be TTM but i really need someone to talk to and cant find anywhere else to chat about it. So here goes...
I have recently been experiencing the urge to pull out the hair around my anus! I have done alot of thinking about it and decided to ask for advice on here as i'm too embarrassed to go to my GP for advice.
I believe that the reason i am having this urge is beacause i feel as though i have an excessive amount amount of hair in that area. Just lately it has really started to aggrovate me as sometimes during a normal day i will be walking around and my anus feels as though the hairs are twisting together and pulling/ripping out at the roots, this really hurts and requires me to go to the toilets to try to sort things out.
Because of the recent aggrovation i decided to try to remove the hair with a pair of tweezers but i just couldn't do it because it hurt too much. I have previously tried to remove the hair by shaving it, forgetting that the hair will grow back even thicker.
I don't know what i can do now as i feel as though i can't just leave it because it is beggining to interfere with my everyday life. I have considered waxing it off but am not sure if i should because i am young and inexpirienced with that kind of thing. I would like some advice as to what i could do to remove the hair, in the least painful way possible.

"Hi folks,
Came across this forum and could'nt wait to pour my heart out. I am a 30 year old MBA working in a managerial position with a leading financial services company. I was suffering from severe OCD in childhood (I was about 10 years old) when I would worry constantly about my fathers well being. It was classic - I had rituals to ensure he would come home safe, sitting on the same sofa, wearing the same clothes. I hated going to school simply because all I could think of was somethings gonna happen to my father. It was a living hell. My parents were both working and were aghast at having a 'mental' child. I myself realised I was not normal and hence tried to constantly prove to others around me that I was bright, intelligent and that is why propbably, a little different. The fact that my mother was not particularly happy with my dad only worsened the situation. The result is that I did not do as well academically in school as I should have and I was ridden with complexes.
College went fine, with god's grace I did very well and managed to be a good student and now hopefully, a good professional. The problem is, I think the OCD still rears it's ugly head. I don't worry about dad too much these days (thanks partly to cell phones!), but I worry about many other things. I worry that I may not do well in my career, I worry about finances, I worry about something drastic that could happen to me or my family....I almost always have the worst case scenario in my head. While this does'nt bother me much when things are fine, even a little stress (at work or home) drives me nuts. I feel unable to handle pressure and constantly avoid taking even mildly risky decisions. This has also affected my career moves as I always like to 'play it safe' lest something goes wrong.
I am always seeking reassurance or validation from others. Wifey and I are expecting our first baby (yippee) and I feel i should be more in control of my emotions that I am. Life can throw surprises and I don't think I am emotionally stable enough to handle them. I recently went to a therapist and he gave me some prozac and told me that while I have intellectual acceptance of my problem, the emotional acceptance is lacking.. I am still not sure if this is recurrent ocd or some other problem.

"Hi,
I'm 20 and I suffer from OCD for as far as I can remember. I've had therapy with psychologists for multiple times, to the point where I thought that I was cured, but sooner or later it would come back.
About a year ago I started using meditation and positive thinking to controle my OCD, I was doing good until recently where I found myself in the middle of a torrent of problems. Problems in work, relationship problems, money problems, etc. And when problems appear, so does the OCD.
I start developing little rituals, habits to """"""""control my bad luck"""""""", and eventually it gets to the point where EVERYTHING that I do is controlled by rituals and as to be done a certain way.
But enough is enough. I made a list of the top ten rituals/fears that I have associated with my OCD, and one by one I will try to break them.
10- Look everywhere. (I avoid looking at certain things with the fear that they'll bring bad luck)
9- Cleaning """"""""luck junk"""""""" (I keep stuff, mostly little items that have no use, with the tought that they brought me luck some day and if I throw them away the good luck will end)
8- Home Clothes (I always use the same articles of clothing when I'm at home and when I have to dress something else I get really anxious)
7- Glasses-Pants-Shoes (in the morning i always dress myself in a specific order, if I don't, the whole day will be filled with bad stuff)
6- Internet limitations (I'm afraid to go to certain sites, see certain videos because I associated them with bad luck at some point)
5- Billy Talent in the car (a band that I listen to since I was a kid, but the last two times that i listened to it while driving it brought me bad luck so I stopped doing it)
4- Music at Work ( i really liked to listen to music while at work but somehow I associated it to annoying customers coming in and stuff like that so I stopped it too)
3- Small rituals (all the rituals that I have: the order that I put my items in my pockets, putting the seat-belt only after starting the car...)
2- The Braces (a band that I used to listen to, but because of some event I started seeing it as bad luck, specifically bad luck in my relationships)
1- Misfits T-shirt ( my number one fear! a t-shirt that I bought like 2 years ago and only wore it twice, and in the only two times I wore it I had really bad arguments that really brought me to my knees)
So yeah, that's the list that will follow this coming week. I must confess, I'm really, REALLY scared just by looking at number 1 and number 2 that's why I came here. Is there some kind of advice, comforting words that you guys could give me? I'm really hoping to put this to rest once and for all but I feel scared before even starting.

"I really need help. I'm scared of living the rest of my life with doubts and worries.
I know everyone has doubts and worries about things but mine is excessive worry to the point where I sometimes vomit because I cannot take it anymore.
I keep seeking reassurance which does help to a degree but I need more and more because new doubts appear and I just cant take it anymore.
Is it best to just resist against all reassurance or can it sometimes be helpful?",[],['excessive'],['excessive'],,1.0,,,
"Since I was a teenager I have been struggling with what seems to be OCD, tormenting my brain with certain rituals that I have to do in my head in order to ease anxiety and to carry on. It has honestly been exhausting. I have learned to curb it a bit and have taken some control back, however one thing that I cannot stop and its honestly just killing me inside is my finger picking.
For years now I have bitten my nails, and they aren't grossly short at all, its the skin around my finger nails that is destroyed. Sometimes I go through good patches where its all clear and it honestly makes me feel so good about myself then a few days later without being able to pinpoint when it started my fingers are bloody, chewed and just destroyed and its so frustrating because I can't remember when and how it started. Most of the time when I am biting them its actually easing my anxiety a lot and it gives me a lot of comfort , and also I am """"""""fixing"""""""" the skin by """"""""trying"""""""" to bite away certain parts to try smooth and perfect.
I continusoly get little dry skin patches on my hand in which I then try and fix by chewing and biting at it which usually only makes it worse.
At the moment my hands are at the worst and everyone is starting to notice and its killing me inside. It's making my anxiety and depression a lot worse and I am rarely leaving the house unless I have to go to work.
I really don't know what to do anymore.
Does anybody understand, or experience something similar, I always feel so alone with this.

"That's how I feel.
I started taking Paxil today, but I obviously cant feel effects yet.
I'm a disaster, yesterday I noticed I had a bit of chipped nail varnish in my tooth - that set me off, all the times I've painted my nails, how much chipped nail polish have I ingested, what damage has that done?
He made a cup of tea for me last night, but he'd just put a washing on without washing his hands - so I couldnt drink the tea incase it has washing powder in it which really annoyed him
Took it off the nail varnish this morning with nail varnish remover, splashed a bit of the ktichen counter and my face, I went into complete panic my partner said I need 24 hour care I cant do anything without having some sort of panic I try and do deep breathing but I need like I'm just making myself and other people ill.
We've been together 8 years he understands my OCD but I'm making living with unbearable, even the posioning other people from the crisps is flooding back all these thoughts - i see fact in them , that they are risks.

"I don't know what to do, my exams are soon and it's affecting my revision. My OCD has been largely dormant or close to non-existant for the past year. I've had OCD for 8 years since I was ten years old, there's been periods of when it was EXTREMELY serious and when it was dormant - those with OCD will know exactly what I mean. The thing is though my OCD has been disappearing since I started college in 2006, I really really thought it was gone, I mean really, it was like my OCD was FINALLY something unsignificant in my life and to have it come back suddenly just like that is killing me, depressing me, worrying, stressing me.
Ok, cut to it short my OCD is fearing about not being able to sleep. This includes fearing of not being able to sleep because of stress, therefore when I perform my stressful rituals it doesn't really help, at all. But I have to because I fear it'll be even more stressful if I don't. Basically, to me it's either to perform the ******* fustrating rituals despite my high reluctance and sleep a bit later or not perform them at all and sleep very late and thus not be able to sleep thus making me tired the next day.
My OCD was suddenly triggered again unexpectedly last week. It was the night before my English exam which was in the morning and I was worried. I think I slept for 20 minutes before my mum woke me up when she walked up the stairs and then I couldn't sleep after that. I was really worried, I tried every technique that I used in the past that used to always work but for some reason it didn't this time. I was worried because I wanted enough sleep for the exam otherwise I would fail and I needed to pass this exam so I could get into uni. So here I was trying every technique such as taking deep breaths (whilst being really stressed) did that and kept getting fustrated and it didn't calm me down, I tried to just 'not think' and just go to sleep which didn't work, I also tried to think that it was no point getting fustrated and that it sooner or later I would fall asleep - didn't work. So I kept trying all the techniques and getting more and more fustrated and got out of bed twice to drink some milk. First time it didn't work (maybe it was because it was cold milk??), second time did though maybe because it was hot milk.
I managed to get a few hours of sleep but then I started to worry that the same ordeal would happen again the next two days because I had maths the next day and a 3 hour english exam the day after. I was ok that night because I was tired from the night before. And I was okay on friday.
However, I've been worried on sunday night, monday night and all day today. I was late today for class cause I slept a later because of worrying of not being able to sleep last night and performing the rituals. One of my main rituals and concern in my OCD is eating enough so I won't feel hungry when I go to sleep. As a result, my meals for the past 8 years have been right before I go to sleep. But because of the stress I feel like it's increased my appetite AND IT'S ******* ANNOYING cause I have to eat more, making me sleep later. I also have to make sure I'm not thirsty so I drink about a litre of water before I go to bed. I also have to make sure that I don't need have the urge to urinate when I'm in bed so just before I go to sleep I have to pee, wash my hands, pee again and if nothings coming out I have to stand there and wait til I pee and I have to do this until it 'feels right'. The last couple of rituals however, have been dormant for a year or so and the eating ritual hasn't been that much of a worry until now.
The thing that is bugging me is that in the past the worry of not being able to sleep was only when I was performing the rituals, however I'm worrying when I'm not performing rituals, I'm worrying in my everyday activities such as when I was in lesson today I couldn't concentrate or just every second of the day in general today. I DON'T KNOW WHY. I mean in the past I would perform the rituals and when I go to sleep I wouldn't worry, I would be okay but now even when I do the rituals I'm still worrying. I really don't know what to do this time, I mean I am a veteran in OCD but none of the techniques are working, in fact I feel like I forgotten some techniques because it's been such a long time when I needed them. I don't know what to do, I have no one to talk to, I don't talk to my parents like at all they would be my last option and even then they won't be that much of a help. I have never talked to my friends about my OCD ever or anyone apart from my psychologist when I used to see her. So when my OCD is bad like now I keep it all bottled up, I act like nothings happening in my mind and like I'm happy. I need help, I want to cry.
I'm scared of falling into depression. Please help, I don't want to fail my exams. I don't know what to do. I keep trying to self-talk, telling myself that it's an irrational fear and that I'm overreacting and asking myself what the worst that can happen, but the worry isn't going.
That's what I used to do and that's what I've been trying but it's not working.
I have my meal at around 11-11:30pm until 12:30am or so and then I would drink about a litre of water. This has been my routine for the past year, I had it under control, it was fine, I wasn't worried about it but now I would finish my meal at 12:30am or so but because of the stress I feel my stomach isn't feel enough so I have to eat more, I mean last night I didn't finish eating until 1:40am.
After my eating and drinking routine, I would go upstairs and then do my peeing ritual. Before last week, I would just pee once or twice and then go to sleep fine, but now I feel like I need to pee more prolonging my chance to sleep. I fear that if I don't pee, it would build up when I'm asleep and awake me and I won't be able to go back to sleep. After last week, I also started rinsing and gargling my mouth compulsively with tap water when I'm in the toilet cause I feel my mouth is dry.
I would tell myself not to do this, but I would get stressed more making me less likely to sleep.
AAAAAARGGHH
The thing is, I had an exam on January as well and I was worried because basically it was a very hard exam the PYA4 psychology one. I mean the night before I sort of worried but certainly not to this extent and the days afterwards up til last week when my OCD was triggered again I had no worries. My only worry was holiday times cause I would sleep late and my sleeping routine would just go and I would slightly worry cause I have to readjust before college starts again. That was my worry and it wasn't anything big.
My next exam isn't until 2nd june and my final exam doesn't finish til 17th june. I don't know if I can handle this for a month.
Over the past 8 years, I have always pondered taking sleeping tablets, sometimes I really wanted to because I wished the worry would end. But I've always had the fear of that it will knack my sleeping all together or become reliant on it especially during now when my OCD is bad, I start becoming reliant on things that I think will decrease the stress or help me sleep better, that's why I'm scared of new rituals coming in.

"I have OCD and it's pretty bad. It has been like this for the past couple of years. I have told my parents that I have OCD and that it is the source of my problems. but while they agree with me that I can go to a psychologist and feel better when I say that I should go to one, they don't actively encourage me to do so. It seems like most of the time that I say that a problem is because of OCD to my mom, she laughs and says """"""""maybe you don't have OCD."""""""" """"""""You don't have OCD.""""""""
I just want to kill someone.
Last Summer I had a short conversation about OCD after which my dad said """"""""well then I think the solution is for you to go to a psychologist and go as soon as you can"""""""" and he said that he can help me look for one. But after I found a psychologist by myself the next week he never talked about it again. I was going to that psychologist during the semester while I was away at college and my dad never bothered to ever ask me how it was going, despite that conversation. And it wasn't even going well - we stopped seeing each other halfway through the semester and I was facing a lot of OCD that semester. I had to tell him in passing that I stopped seeing her and that I found another psychologist after that semester. He never once asked me about it.
The reason I got angry right now isn't because of talking to my parents. I actually haven't talked to them for a few hours because they went to bed and I'm staying up right now because I'm having a weird sleep schedule. I just was having a lot of OCD and while I was doing the OCD ritual, I started thinking about my anger towards them for dismissing my OCD. That sometimes happens to me where I get angry at people in my mind who have made me angry recently if an OCD ritual takes too long. I'm not sure why. The last time I got angry at my parents was two days ago, on New Year's Eve when, after I woke up (well I woke up late, like around 6PM because I've been home from college and have been having a weird sleep schedule lately), my OCD rituals were taking longer, and I was grumpy. I started being sad and I noticed that neither my parents nor my grandparents paid attention that something was wrong with me. Even when I was crying laying down in another room two people walked into that room to take medication and left without talking to me, and I think my dad who was one of the people even saw I was crying. (He asked if I wanted to get tea and I might not have answered him because I was grumpy, and then he said """"""""okay then"""""""" and he left.) I know that in this situation it might make sense that people wouldn't realize that something was wrong with me. What I think made me so angry and feel so alone and depressed (I started crying more after 12AM and felt really alone for like a half an hour) was that I knew that if I tried saying that my problems were because of OCD people would just dismiss it.

Last summer when I was living at home I would act grumpy towards my parents a lot because I felt like they were being mean by not encouraging me to get help for my OCD. Because I had OCD and there they were, not doing anything about it. That's how I felt on New Years Eve and just now. I don't want to feel like that. But I might struggle with OCD again in the near future like I did on New Years. And I feel like they just won't care. And that if I told my mom that I had a problem with OCD, I feel like she would tell me that I don't have it. Which is not true at all. UGH!! It makes me so angry. Had anyone else experienced their family members just blatantly not understanding the seriousness of their OCD?

"We all know I have different themes. Pocd being the main one. But I always jump back to ROCD and cheating. I have no controll over that.
I got sick now as I have worried so much. I am not asking for reasureness...just want to tell you whats going on with my life.
For a year I have not drank because I am afraid I will cheat and forget it. To avoid this, I do not drink.
But I remember one time I did. I drank one cider and a half with my bf and his friends. Than we went out later and I drank a glass of bailyes.
I am worried since I drank I cheated on my boyfriend and dont remember. I dont even know if I got tipsey, let alone drunk -.- It was a year ago and I dont remember much of the night in genreal because its awhile ago. I do remember my bf leaving me alone for abit, and I sat on my mobile.I talked to his friends. I remember telling myself DONT CHEAT.

"After some particularly bad ocd problems I decided to go to the mental health clinic in my area even though I had gone 15 years before and they only recommended medication and my problems are much deeper than ocd. I felt bad going back, much worse than I expected, I had a 2 hour session with the intake worker and it had a few moments that startled me. I didnt go back for further treatment, partly because he would have to re-assess me and I didnt want to see him again.
I didnt complain about what had happened, my ocd symptoms were down a little, but recent stresses like my mother falling and breaking ribs, and being accused falsely of shoplifting or something unknown caused my ocd to get bad again and scary in ways I dont recall happening before. And often during these periods the face of the intake worker would appear to me and make me more anxious and upset.
So finally, I decided to call and talk to the supervisor about the behavior of him-just in case it made me feel a little better.
So I called and told her that when I was being interviewed I was a bit anxious and I used hand gestures(nothing extreme) and he asked me if I was jewish, and wondered if my hand gestures scared people away frm me in public. I cried a little in the intake session about my fears for my future with my mother and the problems I have with my brother(he is sociopathic).
The intake worker asked me later if anything dramatic had triggered my ocd to get worse and I said when my cat died and he laughed.
Then later he said that my life was a mess
and when I said that the supervisor stopped me and commented with surprise: he said that to you? that you're life was a mess?
I said yes
then I said he had told me it sounded like I needed a kick in the pants..
and she said """"""""what? he used those words?""""""""
I said yes and I started to cry as I was talking and shaking.""""""""
she said he should not have done that and she would take up this issue.
I am glad I called.
At this point I dont have much treatment options. i could go to another intake worker-spill my guts again, and they will recommend drugs and occasional psychiatrist visits.
I can go to the family doctor and get a referral to a private psychiatrist. Supposedly there are a couple in the area that treat people with OCD although the ratings of one isnt very good.
I think the best help would be to get some activity i enjoy and feel good about that breaks through my standard day of isolation.
But this OCD is constantly mutating it seems--not just the rituals but how I think about the condition so I dont know.
I sure dont think the Brain Lock method would help me!

"Its been a while since i posted in, 
Positive is, ive been doing really great and have started high intensity CBT (2nd session in) Therapist has said alot of my ocd is fuelled by hypervigilance and a GAD so lots to work on. 
We have established alot of my intrusions now are heck of alot of WHAT IF questions. 
so hopefully will work through those too. 
my question is, can the 'theme/content' of these intrusions jump? 
Due to the harm intrusions i usually experience and checking my emotional responses to my children (compulsive behaviour) 
But never really encountered it with my partner. weve been together 8yrs next march and weve been through alot, weve had a fall out over time spent together & i feel he is quite insecure and quite scared of losing me as he puts it this had led to him trying too hard / being a little suffocating when ive reassured him he is enough. its led to a futher fall out today and i said maybe we have drifted apart as soon as i said it ive been sat in turmoil questioning why and if i love him, how do i fix things, do i want to continue with the relationship, feelings of guilt because i know this is hurting him ..im getting myself all upset, ive had to sit in another room so children dont see me cry

"So basically I'll start off by saying I stayed sober through out the whole night. Most people were drinking and I didn't take part in it. I'm the type that can't just have two beers so I can't be drinking at all. So recently I have been having a hard time with my digestive system. It's either the meds, or stress but I have been getting a lot of diarrhea. It sucks because it's showing me a new world of worry. We had the party at my house THANK GOD. About 40 people were here and I had to go really bad. I was trying to hold it cause it would be a living nightmare to go while people were here but I had to. I did however still wipe with alcohol wipes after I went. And it's always excessive. It comes to about 10 wipes in a certain order that can not be broken. Now I don't think I would of managed going with just toilet paper or even baby wipes for that matter but what I did was a huge step for me. I usually go and NEED to shower before I mingle with people. What pushed me was it was my sisters day and it wasn't about me so I pushed through it. I'm happy to say I stayed sober throughout the whole party. And I'm grateful I didn't use it as a crutch to run away because believe you me I'd just isolate and be passed out drunk if I started drinking and that would of been very selfish.","['diarrhea', 'toilet']",['excessive'],"['toilet', 'excessive', 'diarrhea']",,1.0,,,
"I feel like I am going insane (again) I want to stop it all and the only way I can I feel currently is to end it but I have children and they are the only thing keeping me going, just got back from holiday which is always a trigger for my OCD some call it pure O. I have suffered with this for over 10 years been in and out of therapy and basically all my ruminations are usually around past events, so things that have happened but my brain twists them, for example it has taken me 10 years to realise I am not a murderer (past altercation with a child when I was a child got twisted into murder thought).
It took 7 years for my brain to exaggerate this incident to this level. I always have what I call manageable OCD inbetween the really awful ones, weight related etc etc.
  Now again over a year after this new incident I am not able to stop thinking about something I have done, this is made more worrying as it was a sexual role play scenario with my ex which I feel inappropriate about even though no one else was involved apart from 2 consensual adults. I cannot switch by brain off with this thought, I am wondering if I do have something to feel guilty about, and whether this is a just feeling to have, although deep down it must be OCD or why would I care, it didn't bother me at the time but now my brain has taken me out of context I cant cope.

"Hi all,
I am doing my A-Levels and tomorrow is my French speaking exam. Yesterday I was fussing over it when a memory suddenly hit me - it really took me aback. Pretty much this time last year I was doing the same thing preparing for my AS speaking exam when I had one of the worst spikes that I had ever experienced. It was so terrible that it destroyed any time that I had left for preparation and made me a complete wreck for the rest of the day - obviously at a very crucial time. The day of the exam I had not completely recovered and was feeling very very low.
Now one year later I can thankfully say that this is no longer the case. Due to my efforts and the support of many people I know, I now feel so much better. CBT is a godsend, the people closest to me are fantastic and I have to credit myself for having the will to continue fighting this terrible condition.
Yesterday I was thinking about how much happier I am now than on this day a year ago - and thankfully haven't had a spike of that magnitude for a while now. I am still definitely not completely better, but I can now see the horizon that I didn't believe was there a year ago - when I was near my lowest point.
OCD is not something that should be allowed to rule us - every single one of us has the capacity to combat it, no matter how futile it feels or agonizing it is. I wouldn't have believed this a year ago, but now looking back I am so much happier now. Everyone remember to keep the faith, and make sure that you find out whatever it is that you are able to do to start the healing process.
Best wishes to all of you

"Sorry guys, this may be a long one as I need some opinions from anyone who can help me.
I could only get an appointment with a 'Nurse Practitioner' today, who is 'as good as a doctor' apparently. I found her really quite abrupt and patronising to be honest and felt she belittled my concerns as me blowing things out of all proportion.
I gave her my 'list' of things I'd written down. She went through it (after commenting on how long it would take her to read it, AND taking a 5 min phonecall...), some of which she read aloud. As she went through, she was going """"""""nah, not OCD"""""""",......""""""""nope, not that either""""""""........""""""""nope, sorry, that's not OCD either"""""""" etc etc, really like """"""""sorry to disappoint you, luv"""""""" tone.
She told me there was """"""""nothing much wrong with me"""""""" and that """"""""all you have is mild to moderate depression and anxiety"""""""". And she gave me VENLAFAXINE, said I was to come back in a week and that if I self-harmed she would take it personally! Why would she say that to someone who is feeling 'beneath' most people and full of anxiety etc? Now I am worried I may 'end up' doing just that and then I will be a bad person in her eyes and score a lecture into the bargain! AND when I showed her my scars, which are thin and faded by now, she said """"""""oh for goodness sake!"""""""" like """"""""is that what you call self-harm??""""""""
Is it me or what was THAT??!?!?!?
I am going to post a mini version of my 'list' I took in, along with what she said was the cause of each one to see what you think, I don't see how my last doctor can send me to a psych for OCD treatment and this woman say I just have a touch of depression?!
1) Intrusive music (y'know, 5 secs of a song OVER AND OVER for hours) - just rumination not OCD
2) Random nonsense words popping in my head when I need to concentrate etc - Just anxiety - not OCD
3) Being gripped by anxiety at the thought of getting out of bed without going through all my clothes mentally to find the 'right' ones to wear - a self-esteem issue not OCD
4) Re-reading letters/emails/posts I've written, 'just in case' - poor concentration not OCD
5) Uncontrollable images of violence towards others or of self-harm that knot my stomach and scare me or freak me out - just scaring myself, depressed people do that not OCD
6) Over-responsible/guilt/reasurrance amplified hugely (like I felt devasted I said no to my gf asking for one of my beers, I cried through feelin bad) - low self-esteem not OCD
7) Inappropriate thoughts when close to people (like I am gonna hit, hug, kiss or touch or be verbally offensive to people like my Mum or total strangers, freaks me out, real anxiety causer) - what's wrong with hugging strangers? not OCD
8) I have to walk/sit/sleep on the left of people or the anxiety is so strong, I feel it all through my body - Oh, well THAT'S a bit OCD-ish - thanks...
9) The whole feeling like you're gonna push someone off a bridge or in front of a train or jump yourself? - again, depressed people do scare themselves not OCD
10) The thing I said about thinking gf's dad would murder her if they went nightfishing, couldn't stop the thought, I lost sleep, cried, soooo stressed with it? you're just protective of them - not OCD
11) the 'liar' thing (did I make this all up, will I be believed, am I a liar? etc etc - really helped by her today!!!!!!!) low self-esteem not OCD
And that's about it (or all I am gonna write anyway).
Sorry it's so long, but I am really confused now, who is right? Is what she said right? In which case have I really made everything up? :clapping:
I don't know what to do now I am so mixed up. Please can someone help me out here? After all my worries over going to see the doctor this has just compounded everything I fear and I feel so useless now.

You feel good about yourself, feel like you're getting somewhere, and then you take 3 steps backwards because of them. But I guess, that's what we have to do in order to fight this.","['OCD', 'Thought']",['spike'],"['Thought', 'spike', 'OCD']",1.0,,,,
"I know that by posting this here, it would seem like I require reassurance. Which won't help this time.
I went to the doctor today to talk about why I may not be having so much pleasure and sensitivity during sex and losing erections during sex, etc. He did say that the mind is involved in sex, but also said: """"""""if you're gay, you're gay, if you're bi, etc...no good repressing it...we don't have a cure to make anyone heterosexual"""""""", etc. I left there wanting to cry.
He looked as if he thought I was repressing it. He looked at me distrustfully. He said that, because they are running late and busy, he couldnt allow me to go into depth, start at the beginning, etc, coz he would have to interrupt me, so he rebooked me for 24th Oct. But it looks as if he thinks Im gay, which Im actually wondering myself anyway.
Also, before I went there, I watched some hetero porn, got an erection, got up to do something (can't remember, change some PC settings or something), then lost it for the rest of the porn clip. I thought: """"""""maybe try gay porn to see if you erect or like it"""""""". I turned on some bi porn as thats all the site had with one girl and two guys in some scenes and just two guys in others. The scenes with guys in it, I had half my face covered, and didn't actually care about what was going on (BJs). I watched a clip with a girl with a guy and another guy behind THAT guy.
I was more analysing it than allowing myself to see if I liked it.
Reading a mag in the waiting room, I saw """"""""21% of couples break up due to erection dysfunction"""""""". I was almost ready to cry. I guess I should end it with my gf. But I don't want to. Sure, it would mean less pressure and anxiety, less URGENT questioning, but also, it would officially STAMP my life as OVER and POINTLESS. I would just be living in order to work, eat, and the possibility of being gay with men. I am 25yo. I cant go on another 50 yrs with it being POINTLESS.
If I am or have to be gay, I wish I would have known it as a kid, so I could have adapted to it. I really dno if being gay (I mean, the ones that know from age 10 etc) would have been worse than sexual identity crisising for who knows how long. The gay side at least means the person accepts their life and is happy. The ID crisis means living daily like you want it to be your last.
I dont want to be the one to break up with my gf. I dont like discussing my problems with my friends, but I did say to my friend that I dont get much pleasure out of sex but she does, and he said (he was high): """"""""you're not good at it then."""""""". I said: """"""""for ME, Im not good at it"""""""". He said: """"""""that means you're not good at it"""""""".
At least when single, I could fall apart and not give a where the pieces landed. I could say flippant things like: """"""""fine, I will go to a gay bar"""""""". I could focus on other things like hobbies and not try to feel sociable or loving or intimate or care. I could reminsce to old TV shows and music from my supposed hetero/dormant homo days. But I have to be this performing, loving, provider machine, and it is not fair to get her hopes up or to see mine dashed.
I know that this is my last relationship with a girl, coz it has been so much pressure. The getting close was good, but sex is too spikey and pressurefilled. If I have to break up with her, that's it, I might as well BE gay. At least I will not have to ever again care about my feelings towards anyone. Say if I got a bf, I wouldnt have to agonize over if I love him or not, if Im gay or not. I would not have to care.
Edit:
I've had a morning. I thought I would turn on a gay full-on scene. At the intro (it showed some full-on threesome material, guy, middle guy, girl), I looked at it and felt a strange groinal response when I looked at what was going on with the guys, like some movement was going on inside my penis, but not when I looked at what was going on with the guy in the middle and the girl. Then the scene began. I didn't erect but I am very anxious and that may be the cause. The groinal during the intro was the most feeling I had out of the whole session. I didnt try to masturbate to it, just see if I would get an erection, or like it. All the time, I was scared that an erection would occur.
Note, I was very anxious and was worried that the outcome would decide the rest of my life, so I doubt I could get an erection.
I went back to the intro and no groinal this time.
What is messed up is, the sensation/groinal was familiar from those Ive had in gay dreams. I kind of dull, haunting feeling that arousal is around the corner. I may not have bonered, but I sure didn't pass. I dunno if I need to watch again. I was going to be content with reading coming out stories then giving myself a break, but now I dunno what to do.
I havent spoken to my gf (should I even use that word anymore) today coz my phones and/or hers seem to not work. I feel so anxious now. I dunno how to face her tonight. I dunno if I should break up with her or see if she does it. It's not only """"""""am I bi/gay?"""""""" but """"""""am I hetero enuff?"""""""".
Again, no need to say """"""""u have ocd, read 4 steps"""""""". I guess I should face facts and have posted this on a nonOCD forum, like a depression or LGBT forum.

"Hello,
I was getting on with life fairly OK-ish, which I am incredibly grateful for, even though I still had spikes tapping at the back of my mind I was just about able to go on life, I would ruminate but not to an extreme point. But now, the spikes involving my dog that passed away have gotten bad again, I guess because I have remembered something new that I hadn’t thought of before. I don't know how to continue on with my day without arguing against the thoughts that make me feel like I'm scum. I was thinking about an incident where I smacked my dog, she growled at me and so to tell her off I smacked her again. I think I may have even smacked her a third time for growling again. I feel like a dog beater, and I think quite possibly I am. Now I’m thinking about how many times I may have smacked her repeatedly? and how hard did I smack her? I just don’t know. I’m even smacking myself- on the leg, head etc.. to test out how hard I may have smacked her. But of course I just don’t remember. I have a memory of knocking her over by smacking her, but I don’t know if I have made this up.
I guess my point is, how do you get on with your day and try to live a normal life when you hate yourself? I know we aren’t supposed to ruminate as it feeds OCD and makes us have unhappy lives, but not ruminating leaves me with the feeling of being a terrible person and therefore still leading an unhappy life. The only way I can start to feel somewhat normal is by ruminating- but there comes a point where I can’t ruminate any more because the facts of what I did are there, I think I am just a bad person. How can argue against what I did to make myself feel better? These spikes are like a kick to the stomach and everytime I imagine my dog I hate myself.
I do know how to carry on with this.

Hello,
I have posted numerous times about the same topic, but I have discovered some new information that makes me hate myself even more. I just want to cry all day. I can't go about my daily business acting OK because I simply don't deserve to. I feel I have commited one of the worst crimes as my crime involves making another life be scared, nervous and fearful for 18 years. If you would like the full story, I have quoted previous posts below.
The new information I have is regarding my dog. Yesterday I was looking through home videos (which I haven't looked at since my spikes about my dog began as I was too fearful to), I was hoping to see her looking happy and to convince myself that she wasn't scared and that she didn't have a bad life. I found the opposite. Just when he name was called, she would look around to the person calling her and then she would put her ears down. Through my extensive research I have found that this is what dogs do when they are being submissive or fearful. I can't cope to think that just making eye contact with a person (like me) made her fearful. This seems like a high degree of submission, was she always scared? Are there lots of dogs like this, or was mine unusually submissive beciase of the things I did? I can't forgive myself. I am afraid to just see another dog interacting with a person, because I end up comparing to my dog. I don't know how to carry on like this.
If you can, please help me.

"Hiya,
I know there have been so many posts about this before and also i am sorry if i am just repeatin what i have already said in my other posts but i just have 2 get this out.
I am peterfied i am actually turning if not already sczhiophrenic. I worry my OCD symptons are so different from other peoples.
Let me explain...
I am constantly in fear i am being watched by powers to see if i am doing my rituals right and i also get just a random feeling of what if i am being watched? especially when i am alone when i feel like this i get so scared and anxious it is like i can't breath and i worry i am sczhiophrenic but when i am less depressed calmer less anxious and overall feelin better bout life i can see more so that its irrational! but i can't focus on that at other times at the time it feels so scary and i question if i am going mad or loosin touch with reailty.
People say sczhiophrenics are different but every time i look up a sympton i think some how if i twist it a bit it sounds like me i am so scared am i offically turnin sczhiophrenic or even worse am i already sczhiophrenic?
I am scared of my voice talkin in my head thinkin what if it is voices? what if powers can see into my mind?
Oh i can't cope with this.

"My previous shrink said I have some traits of it, but it was never formally added as a diagnosis.

when stressed, I will get thoughts of violence, either happening to me or other people, or me as the perpetrator.

I've been left crying randomly numerous times because I'll believe I've really hurt someone, even when I know it's not true.

I dont really have rituals in obvious ways, but I notice little things sometimes, like today I caught myself scanning up and down on facebook without even refreshing the page at least 5 times. I realised I do this a lot.

I dont like throwing things away, even bits of rubbish like bus tickets in case they can serve as a magical reminder of things to make me better, and that if I throw them away I'm throwing part of myself away.

I'll obsess that I've committed a rape or murder, and these thoughts will last anything from a fraction of a second or for minutes if it's really bad.

"I think i have finally come to understanding why i panic sooo much over thoughts, that arnt health related.
Thing is last year when i had my assesment, i got diagnosed of having health anxiety. And not OCD. When i saw another therapist that summer she didnt believe in OCD and wouldnt give me a diagnosis what was wrong with me.All she was going on about was my childhood, parents, the usual and refused to """"""""label"""""""" me as she put it.
This REALLY wound me up, cos i needed to know, i had to have a label to put on the lid of the box so i can work on it.
But to this day i think deep down i am still struggling to deal with thoughts which arnt health related as i was TOLD that i have health anxiety.
And obv i must assume if they are not health related then they must be the real me!. Does that make sense?
I remember on my last week of CBT i had to do my thought diary and i wouldnt read it out as it was about the urge to search for child porn on the net. This totally freaked me out and i got less comments back from the session as it wasnt my usual health concern. Also before this i mentioned how it had shifted to guilt and confessing, that week the talks didnt really include me much either. As it wasnt my usual health problem. Everyone else had 1 theme throughout this """"""""anxiety"""""""" course yet mine went from health,peado,relationships,suicide,guilt,confessing,un wanted urges etc
I dont know why im ranting here, but i do think i have Pure O but cos i havnt been given a proper """"""""title"""""""" then i guess all other thoughts which arnt health related freak me out and i take them to heart thinking they must be the real me
I am not looking for any reassurance with this thread, but i think it could be a main reason why i find thoughts which arnt health related harder to shake.","['OCD', 'urge', 'guilt', 'anxiety', 'anxiety', 'Thought']",['theme'],"['urge', 'anxiety', 'Thought', 'theme', 'OCD', 'guilt']",1.0,,,,
"Hi There,
Ive been a long time reader but just had an unusual bout of courage so thought id get this down quickly!
This might go on abit and i apologise in advance.
I have suffered from OCD related symptoms for the best part of 20 years. I am now 30. I can even remember a friend saying to me, """"""""ive noticed you flicking the light switch on and off over and over"""""""" I must have been 12/13 years old......I had the usual """"""""if i dont do a certain thing, someone will get hurt"""""""" scenario! (I still get this to some extent now)It didnt bother me then, but when i reached 18, things changed and i brushed them off as all part of growing up.
At 18 i met my Girlfriend of 12 years and had the """"""""i think i might be gay thing"""""""", then we had the """"""""i think i fancy someone else thing"""""""", then we had the """"""""oh god, i think im a perv or paedo thing""""""""! Anyway, we got over that and all was forgotten......kind of.
When i hit 25, i realised i had a problem. My anxiety had got so bad that i was doing rituals left, right and centre at work and it was driving me mad. I even brushed that off! I concentrated on sorting the job i hated out, thinking it was this rather than the OCD and went off sick with depression for 6 months and took volantary redundancy. It was about this time that i thought i most probably had OCD. All the symtoms matched but i still got no help. Anyway, i got a new job and life was great for 12 months. Then it all changed.
The last 3 years have been hell. Surprisingly the rituals have simmered down, but the Pure O has come back with avengence. An intrusive cocktail of nasty horrible thoughts has been in my head for the best part of 3 years. Oh yeah, and never mind the Confessional OCD! This is worse than the Thoughts sometimes! Some days i feel i have to tell my Girlfriend everything! and i mean everything! Its just not fair on her!
We have recently been blessed with the birth of our first baby son. He's 5 months now and i absolutley ador him. As you can imagine, its been quite a stressfull time, with the thoughts and everything and ive had it! I think im ready to see someone and get some help. To be honest, its not getting better, im having trouble dealing with it and its getting worse.
Ive noticed it gets alot worse when im tired or stressed......but even when im not tired or stressed its still there, but i just seem to deal with it better.
One thing is bothering me though.
Im scared they will just say its the way i am, im a nutcase/perv/paedo or whatever and interigate me and lock me up!
Anyway,
Thanks for listening,
And sorry it went on for a while......
A very anxious yet thankfull Matt

"This sounds stupid, but I really need some clarification on this, because it's ruining my life and making me miserable
Basically I'm a 21-year-old female, and I have a severe issue wearing underwear, namely bras. I've tried every alternative out there. I've tried camisoles, sports bras, wearing no-bra, every style imagininable, been expertly measured, and yet nothing feels right. Not only do I feel uncomfortable, I feel like I literally, physically can't stop paying attention to wearing one. My senses are completely locked onto it, and I can't concentrate on anything else. If I do try and concentrate on having a normal life, I just end up with a lot of mental anxiety and a pounding headache. I have one right now.
The only time I feel okay is if I am in pyjamas, round the house, all day. It's like there's something in my brain which goes weird if I put one on, that it's not right, it's not touching my body in the right way, etc. If I move my arms, even if I feel it movely slightly, it really shocks my brain. I imagine it's some sort of perfectionism-related OCD, but I'm not entirely sure.
I've had other OCD issues in the past. ROCD, Harm-OCD, philosophical thinking, POCD and all sorts of horrible things, but they've all eventually gone away. This is the theme I've been stuck with for about 8 years and I don't think a day has gone by that it doesn't cross my mind
It sounds stupid, but I'm 21, in university and want to enjoy my life. I'm really annoying my family and other people by being like this, as they think it's daft and that I need to snap out of it. I just don't understand why I get such massive tension headaches when I wear one, yet if I'm just round the house in pyjamas, I feel fine. I feel like there's just something wrong with my brain and it's become such a bad habit that I've become habituated into this way of thinking.
I've tried doing some sort of exposure, i.e. wearing one all the time but it made me feel so bad I couldn't carry on.
I don't want to go to the doctors about it because it's so stupid. I just need to vent + some advice on how to make it better, if possible

Leaving me feeling depressed, the things they did were the little sister would place her hands in the dirty toilet and go around touching everything in the house, the mother would take the mobile house phone in the toilet and not wash her hands, the whole family wouldn't wash their hands after the toilet and the little girl would repeatedly wee in the bath tub instead of the toilet and the mother wouldn't clean it up and I would have too otherwise it wouldn't get done.

I tried touching the bin and not washing my hands afterwards for a few hours but it made me feel light headed and sick and I know I won't die or get hurt from germs but I just don't like them but I also realise I can't control what others do I just need to someway come to terms with certain things and live my life happily.

"What do you think of the Scwartz devotees who say that OCD is purely a biological condition and that you are born with something already skew-whiff in your head? I don't believe it. I think anybody in a given set of circumstances could develop OCD.
I would never blame a parent for the development of their child's OCD. But I do think that the parents unconsciously nurture the development of OCD in their child. I've had it since I was 5 and I've got a father with OCD and a mother who was literally scared of her own shadow. Everything was dangerous according to her. I put this down to her younger brother dying when he was a child, so she evidently formed the opinion that world is a dangerous place where children die.
I can't help but feel that if I hadn't had these two neurotic parents me and my brother would never have developed OCD. It's like they gave us lessons in """"""""How to be anxious about everything"""""""".
So many parents believe everything they read in the newspaper about how dangerous everything is and that there's a paedophile on every street corner. As a consequence they wrap their children in cotton wool and then expect the child to develop into a normal adolescent and adult.
Surely these parents are making their children feel like the world is dangerous and as a child it isn't far-fetched to think you'd develop certain little magical rituals and techniques to make you feel safe.

I am going through weird days where one second I am absolutely happy and feel like I have moved past her and relishing in other girls, the next I am depressed and want things to go back, and then the next day I'm angry and am cursing and very erratic. It just really feels bad, I'm not sure how to take care of myself and slow down. It's just not fun right now and I can't see my therapist till next month so I feel really uncomfortable in my own skin and very alone. I am not liking myself lately and that is quite scary.

"Does anybody else find it very difficult to talk about specifically the ocd spikes, to a doctor or health professional? Unfortunately, I went through a difficult time with stigma, with false memory ocd, and it became less about helping me and more about figuring out if I had actually done something bad. How can we stop this stigma? Why would anyone admit, on record to these thoughts and obsessive worries when all they do, is create a stigma for the sufferer and sling mud onto them.

"Hello,I'm having problems lately involving Sexual thoughts and urges,these thoughts have plagued me for the past 3 years on and off but of late they've come back at me with avengence. I saw a counciller for young people 3 years ago when i was 17 and she told me I had OCD,then i would get thoughts of attacking the person i was chatting with with a weapon and violent thoughts like that,I also got bad depersonalization which made me feel i was in a unreal world and that things didn't seem right,I got better since then although the thoughts that are really disturbing me are the sexual thoughts.
They started about 2/3 years ago hen I finished attending my counciller,the first thought popped into my head was an image of a baby which made me feel worthless I didn't want to speak to anyone for days and my initial fear was that I was a pedophile,I did get better although I now had sexual thoughts of this nature to deal with along with my other thoughts and anxiety,I coped on my own and learned to brush the thoughts away,although I did have my down days which I felt really depressed and worthless. I belive the reason I get such thoughts is that I lead a very unhealthy lifestyle and don't go out much,I have a social phobia at times where I feel akward in crowds or in pubs so I prefere to sit at home online.
Up untill a few months back I would watch porn almost everyday,which obviously turned me on,It would keep linking me to differnt pics as there was that many and eventually i seen things i shouldn't have,and being turned on previously it felt I was turned on by these images. I admit I was probly addicted to pornography and enjoyed watching girls on webcam as many guys do,but when I searched limewire for webcams I got 1000s of results and ones which read 12 year old etc etc,I thought into my self (**** sake) but curriosity got the better of me and I clicked on it,I thought it wont really be a 12 year old,nor did it look like it but then i seen her face I realised it actually was,I immedially turned white and my world felt like it had turned upside down,I stared to panik and feel like (this is the real deal I really am A pedophile),I just got ito bed and felt like crying,thankfully I went out and cleared my head although the thoughts plauged me for days after it.
Sometimes I brush these thoughts off and know I'm not a pervert,I have been doing this successfully for the last few months but latley I've been getting spikes when I see young girls on tele I think I'm turned on by them when clearly I'm not but it very hard to realize this at the time,then there will be days I will be like haha wtf was them thoughts all about then some they will get on top of me and cause terrible depression. I also suffer bad from depersonilization which is killing me slowly,I'm just finding it hard to go on with all these thoughts in my head nd just when i think theve gone away they hit me like a ton of ****.","['urge', 'OCD', 'fear', 'anxiety', 'anxiety', 'joy', 'depression', 'Thought']","['violent thought', 'spike']","['urge', 'violent thought', 'anxiety', 'depression', 'fear', 'Thought', 'joy', 'spike', 'OCD']",1.0,,,,
"If anyone would bear with me I would really appreciate hearing a voice of reason from someone other than my mum (who I love to pieces but she's somehow too close for me to be reassured by)...
Six years ago when I was spending hours in the shower with really bad OCD, my mum came in and picked up a flannel from the bath side that may have had a small spot of poo on it (from me using it to clean myself) and didn't notice, then wiped the leaking water off the side of the bath then put the flannel on the towel rail. She then picked up her keys and left the house to drive to work.
That was one small event mixed into a very horrible stage of my life, but I feel like I'm slipping back down the horrible slope because I can't seem to get the story I have just described out of my head.
You see my worry is that whatever tiny trace of poo may have been transferred to her keys, may have spread to the car and everything she touched after touching her keys. So, even though I cleaned her keys and keyrings a few weeks ago, and the house has been cleaned a thousand times, I can't help worry that anything she touched having touched her keys over the last 6 years could also have a trace of poo on..
If I explained this to another person, would they see reason in it and think I'm a dirty person/live in a dirty home? Or is my mum right, that even people who I make to understand the reasons behind my worry would still put no value in them and not be worried by such a tenuous chain of events... as in, they would think it was all so long ago and traces of poo wouldn't have stayed on her keys and still be spreading about today? I feel like reassurance of this alone would make me feel happy (and not irresponsible) to stop worrying.
I am so often ready to just to forget it all and decide not to worry because the endless worry and cleaning is so exhausting, and even more so because I should be focussing on my A levels not losing hours worrying... but then I convince myself I don't want to stop keeping myself clean of the house and after touching things that could've been contaminated, in case I could spread this contamination to my friends and that they would be unaware, such that if I explained what happened 6 years ago with the flannel, they'd think that I/my house was horribly dirty.
I just need to know whether general people would want me to worry about keeping clean of this, or if they genuinely wouldn't mind...
thank you for everything xxx

"Hi,
I'm supposed to have been 'looking after' myself this week, while my parents are away on holiday. But I've just been a complete failure - mainly because it take me soooooo long to do anything because of washing my hands. I take about 10 mins each time I wash them, sometimes longer, because I check them as well and flap them about to dry them :blushing: (can't use towels.) I've been doing loads of cleaning and in between cleaning each thing I wash my hands so it ends up taking ages. I've had to cook (lots of handwashing in between different stages), do washing - clothes washing (more handwashing) just daily household chores and it takes so long.
When my sister gets home from work, and asks what I've done I don't know what to say. I mean: what have I done? The answer is not a lot - and I can't exactly tell her about all my cleaning rituals. I hate doing things because of the time it takes and the anxiety it causes. Worse still, when she gets home she touches loads of things without washing her hands before, so I have been staying up late into the night cleaning them. This makes me wake up very late the next day, and by the time I've showered and dressed, it's getting on for 4pm, and all I've done is washed and dressed.
I missed college yesterday because I was so tired from staying up very late the night before, and I think I'm falling behind with the work. It's just not like me (I was very conscientious at school) but I just keep putting it off, looking for excuses etc because I know I am just a big failure. Everything I do goes wrong. I can't seem to pull myself together and do something about it. I know I'll have to be independent at some point in my life, and I'm dreading it. My parents have only been gone a week, and already I'm in such a mess. I'm so desperate here, it's beyond a joke (not that it ever was.)
I stuggle to cope sometimes when my parents are here, but when they're gone I barely eat and when I do I eat lots in one go and everything just gets thrown out of balance. I'm sick of being such a baby. Why can't I just do normal things normal people do and spend a normal amount of time doing it??

Its jut no one at my new work knows about my OCD as I feel its for the best at the moment.
Something happened at work the other day and I just cant let it go......my colleague at work asked to borrow my computer password,which I gave her butthen I realized that she was on Facebook (we have been told that we are allowed to use the internet as long as it to do with work)....I was concentrating on the rest of my work, when it dawned on me that she was looking at Facebook under MY password and that if my manager found out I could get into trouble. As usual my head is mesing me aroud and telling me that I was the one who was on facebook....but I wasnt...OCD has its claws in!! Its out of control at the moment and telling me im going to get told off and loose my job!!! But my colleague said that if our manager does find out, then she will be honest and tell her that it was her
Please can you guys post back with advice and support...I know that if the manager does find out, that I will tell her that it was my colleague as that thr truth....my OCD keeps convincing me that it was me that went on the site.....its horrid!!! :-(","['anxiety', 'anxiety', 'site', 'OCD']",['rumination'],"['site', 'rumination', 'anxiety', 'OCD']",1.0,,,,
"Hello,
I haven't been on this wonderful site for ages, basically I've had pure O OCD since I was little, did quite well with CBT and Fluoxtine a couple of years ago.
In August 2008 I stopped the meds because I wanted to try for a baby, and I am now 22 weeks pregnant.
Don't get me wrong, it's wonderful news and I'm very happy..but my hormones, combined with the huge resposibility of having a child, have made the OCD come back.
It started off as washing my hands too much, being obsessive about food, etc.
And now the pure O is back!
I am not looking for reassurance here- I know how bad it is!- but I would really appreciate any advice or just discussing it.
Did any of you take medication whilst pregnant?
Any experience with Bach's rescue remedy?
Any exposure work? ( my therapist said it was best avoided before the third trimester, although I am making a point of exposing myself to my thoughts on a regular basis, just not for too long and not necessarily every single day)

"Hi Everyone,
I hope you are all well and having a good day today - I am currently trying to ban confessing to my wife. As you may know I have an overvalued sense of repsonsibility and have overvalued ideas revolving around my doubt and perfectionism. Wow I'm a complicated individual!
It seems and endless stream of spikes at the moment that I want to confess about, I overcome or slip and confess all, then another comes along, and another. I really want to stopp confessing, I have the determination, but it keeps throwing up something else to upset me. Today I remembered a spike from a couple of weeks ago, where I remember whist checking my emails, I saw one from a female i didn't know titled, 'Facebook: 'Sue has commented on a photo of you'. I remember having the usual intrusive thought and impulse, and my OCD tells me to avoid it and not look. I clicked on it and read that it was from a friend of my wife commenting on a scan photo Sarah put up and tagged me to of our twins. I recognised the lady's name then'.
Because I had that intrusive feeling of excitement because it was an email from an unknown female prior to opening ti rather than avoiding it, my OCD has got hold of it and is making me feel that I have gone behind my wife's back and acted immorally. I know intellectually this was NEVER my intention on opening the email, and I would never conrtemplate emailing this person back, chat them up and have an affair - I would rather die than hurt my wife. But my OCD is making me doubt and that i am this person. I'm tied up in knots over this and need to normailse this with your help.
Thank you so much for your help and having read your posts i realise there are many of you with the same experiences, but my ocd makes me think mine is 'different' and 'special', especially when it says I have done something by an action in the form of opening that email.
Best Wishes and Good Luck!

"I'm feeling pretty rubbish tonight. I keep getting floored by worries that are slightly new variations on my main theme of hyper-responsibility-related OCD. I think it's getting worse because it usually does on the run-up to Christmas and I'm in the process of trying to get up to a decent dose of medication.
I really wanted to talk about it with my Mum but it didn't go well when I tried. She really didn't want to talk about it and even walked off and sat down in the lounge while I was speaking. That immediately made me worse... I was tearful as it was. It made me feel that I've annoyed her, or that I'm a big disappointment to her. I asked her about this which made it worse because she couldn't or wouldn't react how I wanted her to. I just wanted a bit of care and understanding but it wasn't going to happen... then she went out to a carol service leaving me in tears!
I know I shouldn't expect everyone to understand but I had hoped my Mum would be able to show some concern.
I'm lucky because I've got my Dad (who does his best to say the right thing!) and my sister who has some experience of OCD as well, but I wanted to know that my Mum supported me. I told her about some of the things I'd achieved but to her they are all 'normal' things and I don't think she sees them as achievements.
Aghhh! I know I'm feeling sorry for myself... I'm sorry. I just think the CBT would be so much more effective if I could talk about it to someone and get some credit for my albeit small achievements.

I simply do not like the therapist I was assigned to after fighting damned hard to access appropriate treatment.
It's not a question of his approach, pushiness, occasional excessive expectations - it's him. Can therapy be successful if there is no rapport and you don't like the therapist?
I understand having to do uncomfortable things to tackle OCD but he had/has no understanding of the tranquilliser withdrawal program and manipulated me into telling the full name of a friend of mine (which I wouldn't have done if I had felt stronger that day) for reasons nothing to do with OCD.
I'm assuming my only option is to go back to the CMHT and ask to see another therapist for the last eight sessions I am """"""""owed"""""""". Obviously that person won't know me but I see no other options.

"I've had contamination related OCD for about 6 years. It has a fairly crippling affect on my life. In April I went back on sertraline. This followed my partner moving out of our home because my OCD was having such a big impact on our domestic situation. I had pretty much resigned myself that my OCD would always the be the same in the future.
However, earlier this week I had a very weird - but postive - """"""""experience"""""""" about my attitude towards my OCD. It is difficult to describe. It was a kind of cathartic experience. It was very emotional and tearful but at the same time very postive and joyous. I hesitate to say it, but the experience was almost 'religious'; it was almost as though a presence was by me, helping me. The experience was like a revelation, reaching a new understanding. My partner and I have lived apart from half a year now - due to the OCD basically. We were considering buying separate homes. Then I had this ''experience"""""""" however.
The experience was an unswerving realisation, a moment of clarity, that OCD has and is having such a crippling affect on the quality of my life - and our lives - that regardless of whatever merits may apply to my contamination preoccupations, that it is not worth it, that it is ruining my life; and that I must overcome or ignore my OCD thoughts and behaviours and be 'normal' like I used to be. Principally, the experience included the complete acknowledgement that what is the worst that can happen if I cease my OCD contamination-related rituals and comparing that with how much better my life could be without it.
There was this house I saw for sale (we had been looking at property details) and during my experience I told myself that we would buy that house, start again, have a fresh start, and I would be forced to face and overcome my OCD, and indeed I would! My experience told me I could do this. I had to realise what was most important. I would start now to fight my OCD.
Sorry, I just had to share this. I wondered if anyone had had a similar weird experience liek this?
I am intent on getting better, to be 'normal' again. My experience gave me, and inclded, a tremedous will to get better and almost a 'knowledge' that indeed I would! It was a great feeling. :a1_cheesygrin: Afterwards I was a bit manic/hyper.
I am going to get help. I made an appointment with the occupational health dept at work, as I should be able to get up to 10 free, private CBT sessions. Can anyone advise what I can expect from the CBT sessions? Hopefully I should be abel to start them quite quickly as they will be private paid for by work hopefully. Will they be weekly session?

"When I went to see my therapist my key objective was to learn some new tools to enable me to recover from a bad episode of OCD and be ok enough physically to try meds again.
Well the therapist experienced though she and her practice are had not come across my """"""""thought looping"""""""" and in fact when we drew up a new ,map of my problems there are 5 key component areas that contribute to my problems:
Triggers from violent or distressing themes - often words, headlines film or book titles """"""""scanned """""""" for involuntarily by my brain
Thoughts then"""""""" loop""""""""
Brain making connections to other things to create a link to distress (negative free associations)
OCD bringing up previous triggers from memory to perpetuate an episode
6 types of dysfunctional thinking which can contribute to the thoughts. Includes mind-reading , personalisation, emotional reasoning, minimising the positive, back and white thinking, exagerration.
Overt ERP doesn't work when the looping is prevalent.
So I have a lot of challenges - but in general terms when the looping shuts down and my mental shields rise up again the others usually tend to ease back.
So I have a lot to be facing up to at the moment, and she gave me some new tools and I am using them sensibly .
I wasn't able to get my physical fitness back where I would like it to be, but we have got my digestive problems back in a place where I can start the meds - Citalopram -just started a course of it.
So I appreciate the support of the forum members and will look to help others similarly battling along.

I don't think I am a sever case, although I cannot deny I have got some annoying habbits (that drive me around the bend). Therefore the only person who suffers is myself through the anxiety I experience.
BUT I do also have epilepsy. I lead a perfectly normal life & have worked in office work for the last 24 years since leaving college. At the moment I am Off Sick from work on 'Work Related Stress' grounds, due to Discrimination & a Solicitor has told me I have a case to take to tribunal. The Operations Director is an basically (excuse the word being used).
I do ALSO take 20mg Citalopram, more be it because all the epilepsy drugs I take dope me up & actually cause 'Adjitation & snappyness' in me (which I am aware of, but can't consionsly get rid of it because it is a side-effect of the epilepsy drugs. Side-effects cannot be got rid of psychologically. But the other hand is the third Epilepsy drug I'm taking which has caused more adjitation in me, IS actually keeping my medical condition under control. I also had Brain Surgery to improve the condition back in 1992, and read online last night that brains surgery intervention can cause these behaviours in some people with epilepsy, AFTER having had surgery. I will have to enquire about this when I next go to Kings College Neurology Department, as I have kept my 'compulsive' behaviours under-cover until yesterday when I got sick of myself & adjitated with myself for the anxiety I was feeling.
Sorry if I've gone on a bit. Do any of you feel anxious at all? ALSO what other SSRI's have other people been issued with? I'm only on 20mg Citalopram.

"Hi everyone,
i feel a bit silly joining this site as i havent actually been diagnosed with OCD because i havent been to the doctors to discuss it…so a little bit of a background (which is actually scary to think i'm going to start writing what i do down!)
My mum suffered with OCD when i was a teenager, she seeked advice from a healthcare professional and she saw a psychologist...her thing was cleanliness, and a little bit of safety which they worked out that came from a old memory of betrayl from her dad from her younger years.
So i spent quite a bit of time with my parents as a teenager, this was during the stage that Mum started to think this way, so I became her back up…but dealt with it in what now seems the incorrect way, I’d encourage her, I was young so I didn’t know what to do, so when she went over a bump in the road and asked me if she’d just run someone over, instead of saying, no mum that’s silly, I said no mum you didn’t, but for piece of mind…lets go back and check…birthplace of the thoughts I have today? Maybe!
So my checks aren’t really to do with contamination or bad sexual thoughts like some write on here, mine’s more safety and harmful thoughts, this weekend was the worst for me which is why I’ve decided to start looking into help, but I have had these checking things for longer than I can remember now.
This weekend my husband stayed away, leaving me in the house by myself for 3 nights, which I did not sleep a single wink of on any of them because I was petrified that someone was going to break in (we’ve moved into this house within the last 2 months from a secure entry flat before that). Now I know people get scared and that’s normal, but not being able to close your eyes because you think that the moment that you do will be the moment you’ve let your guard down and that’s the moment that your attacker will choose to get you, and then playing out the situations of how you’ll deal with it…what will I throw, will I throw anything, or will I try to shut the door, but then what if my Chihuahua runs out there and they hurt him instead so i just sat up all night watching disney movies to try and distract me from the thoughts...but then what if by the TV being on i cant hear them and then they catch me unawares
So that was this weekend, my other checks are daily, making sure that the back door and front door and windows are locked, but by me checking it, have I now unlocked it…best go check…I’ve even taken pictures and videos of myself doing this to prevent myself going back…but sometimes still not good enough so I still have to go back and make myself late for work
Then there’s my now un-straightened hair, I cant do my hair of a morning because I think that I will leave my straighteners on, and then they will burn the whole row of houses down and it’ll be my fault because I wanted straight hair that day.
I struggle with the thoughts of my husband and my dog dying…like I think I’m going to go home every day to a dead dog, or if my husband goes somewhere for work that he wont make it, then what will I do, how will I cope without him.
I also don’t like odd numbers, when i say i dont like them ,i mean i cant deal with it, it makes me feel a panic in my chest and i just have to change it...if the volume on the tele is on an odd number or if there's an odd number of items like, I’ve recently broken a few glasses in my new kitchen which has left me with 3 glasses and I’ve also lost 3 spoons…leaving me with crying at the thought of having just 3 spoons, people just say why don’t you just buy 1 or 3 more but I cant because then they wont match and everything has to match even down to colour and brand when buying shampoos and deodorants etc…
So I feel stupid, I feel like these are all normal things, and when I try to discuss them with anyone other than my mum they just say o yeh I do that…or well just don’t think about it….i think about everything excessively, if I don’t know something I will literally pull the situation apart and wont stop until I then know that thing,
I have an excessive need to be right all the time and for everything to be perfect, my work says that I’m too competitive and I also take the blame for everything…I will always find a way of transferring things so that its my fault and then get defensive and sometimes nasty because I feel I’ve wronged someone.
I’m a incredibly proud person and I pride myself in being strong, my family have been through a lot and I myself have been through a lot of emotional situations, and I’m always deemed to be the strong one…probably why yesterday was the first day I opened up to anyone about it, a little bit to my husband followed by a conversation with my mum…the only one I feel understands…..so that’s it…i dont know if i have ocd, whether its mild or moderate or whether i am just like everyone says just doing normal things that evryone else is doing too...

"Hi all, I recently have been seeing a councilor and she has dionoised me with OCD and anxiety. I refused depression tablets before seeing my councilor (which turned out to be a good choice) and now have been put on PROPRANOLOL, and now waiting to be confirmed for OCD, also my doctor has forward me to CBT and more councling. My life before councling was going out of control having dark thoughts, and doing stupid stuff, I was and still am constantly saying sorry for the most stupid things, even normal people wouldn't say sorry for, I just put it down to over politeness, I hate people touching me and I love controll in all things! I have to have things done in a certain way other wise I freak out, I don't sleep and only manage a coule ov hours. I even freaked out over a pillow case that I placed on my tv as I was changing my bedding and couldn't find it when I went to retrieve it, I freaked out pulled all the bedding ov and put it back on three times and pulled all the tv out, I couldn't sleep, sit or even think, my whole body was shaking and I even cryed. Some people I know think I'm over reacting and didn't understand why I was behaving in a crazy way when I freak out. I still don't understand my self or what I'm thinking, I'm yet to discover, I remember my councilor asking me how long have I felt like this and my answer was, I don't know. I've thought about it and it's been forever (well since I was little) she's asked me why and my answer was I don't know, me doing all this OCD thing is normal to me because I've done since I can remember, but I can say it's gotten worse over the last five years since my grandad has passed, I thought OCD was for people who overly cleaned all the time, ( how wrong was I) I do hate germs but I don't overly clean I live bleaching my house, I do a deep clean once a week on Sunday and do general bleaching every day but that just normal I think, I don't like people touching me sometimes even my own children which I feel very guilty for, and even my own partner sometimes, he thinks it's funny the way I freak out so sometimes he touches me on purpose just to watch me freak, he just doesn't understand how it makes me feel. I don't like it when I freak out I feel I'm gonna break in half or something, but what I hate the most is fighting with my self, I have thoughts horrible thoughts and it ain't me, it feels like I have a demon or a dark side that's trying to make me bad and I constantly fight in my head with it. I just want to know if any body else has the same feelings and thoughts like me and would explain to me at which end ov the scale I am, I just want to know where I am, if I have it a little bit or excessive OCD, I would love to talk to someone who does unstand my feelings and how lost I feel right now, I've only been on propranolol six days and so far all is good, is any body else on the same tablets and tell me how ur getting on with them.

"Hi all,
I don't actually even know what to say or where to start!
I would say I'm sometimes obbessive but I don't know if I'm """"""""normal"""""""" or over the top? For a long time probably around 8/9 years I have had thoughts that if I didn't do something within a certain amount of time e.g 10 seconds then something bad would happen- usualy to someone close to me. Since moving out 5 years ago I've liked a tidy home as anyone would but a lot of people have been taking the mick out of me saying I have OCD as a joke. I know I have certain issues I need to overcome and really want to so that my traits don't rub off onto my young Son.
Usually its cleanliness, my home is certainly not spotless, but it is again usually bad things will happen if I don't clean. Recently I have taken on smells. I constantly worry if mine and my sons clothes smell clean, and if my home smells clean when I open the door to visitors etc. I also have recently started not going to the toilet when I'm away from home (even if its a friend or family members toilet) because of them not cleaning it properly or washing their hands. I feel dirty drying my hands on other peoples towels because I don't know when they washed it last.
I really need to do something as like I said I don't want to ruin my son with my thoughts, also my relationship is suffering. I get anxious about when my boyfriend is at home without me, what mess he has made and also now the smell when I walk in. he has had enough of me clearing away before hes finished using things.
There are many other things that I can't even put into words to write, I just would like general advice on what I should do, what you do etc.

"I've had OCD about my sexuality for so many years. I'm a 23 year old female and this started five years ago, when I was 18. I always considered myself straight and was always into boys, but a friend told me he was gay and it got me questioning myself for some reason. At first I thought it would be cool to be bi because it seemed so fashionable and I was curious what it would be like to kiss a girl. I started going from thinking it would be cool to be bi, to what if I'm a lesbian and I started questioning myself and worrying about it. I got my first boyfriend and I started thinking what if I'm a lesbian, but then I really grew to like him and it kind of went away. We didn't date for long and I took the break up really hard.
A few months after the break up I was drunk and I got with this girl. This was 4 years ago when I was 19. Ever since then I became so depressed and worried about my sexuality. I freaked out afterwards and was upset, but I wrote on yahoo that I enjoyed getting with the girl, but I can't remember. I was really drunk and confused. I remember the day after I was really upset and confused and scared I was a lesbian? I feel so anxious and depressed thinking about what happened with the girl; the greatest anxiety is thinking that I """"""""enjoyed"""""""" that incident. I keep analysing what happened in my head. I'll post the link I posted on yahoo after the thing with the girl happened.

Sorry for all the links. Ever since I've obsessed about my sexuality and it's made me so depressed and anxious. The idea of being with or getting with a girl makes me feel anxious, depressed and makes me want to kill myself. I know that there's nothing wrong with being with a girl and that my family and friends and others around me would accept me, but the idea of being with a girl fills me with dread. I keep thinking what if I'm denial and I really enjoyed that experience and am not interested in men?
I've always had crushes on guys growing up but I keep analysing my past and doubting if my crushes on guys were ever real. I've always wanted a boyfriend, but unfortunately I've never had much luck with guys as they only want one thing and they don't take me seriously. I get really upset and low when I get rejected by a guy.
What makes me think I'm a lesbian is that the times I've had sex have been one nights stands or when I have had sex sober I wasn't really into the guy that much and didn't enjoy it much. When I've had one night stands I don't remember much, but I have gotten with guys who I don't find attractive sober, but I'm all over them when drunk because I get horny. I don't have one night stands anymore, very rarely because I want a guy to treat me properly. I think going to an all girls school also has contributed to my ocd about sexuality, because I craved the company of boys and my school was very strict and didn't like us being around boys. Plus I didn't have any friends and didn't get a chance to meet any boys.
I keep mentally testing sexual scenarios with a female in my mind and this causes me a lot of distress and anxiety. I feel helpless and I feel like I want to die especially when it seems like I could enjoy doing stuff with a female when I test it in my mind. I spend so long mentally testing that it takes over my life and it wastes so much time. I'm so scared that I could want to do stuff with a girl again and worse, enjoy it. I don't think I'd be able to go through with doing stuff with a girl again, even if very drunk.
Do I sound like I have ocd? I hope I'm not bi either. Do I sound bi?
I also have had other ocd themes like ocd about being a paedo and fears about my health. I also go through phases where I feel a lot better and phases where my OCD really flares up and I feel so distressed and on edge, like I can't stop analysing about that thing with the girl and I keep mentally testing and it seems like I could enjoy doing stuff with a girl!","['Thought', 'interest', 'hope', 'fear', 'anxiety', 'anxiety', 'OCD', 'joy']",['theme'],"['anxiety', 'OCD', 'interest', 'fear', 'Thought', 'joy', 'theme', 'hope']",1.0,,,,
"Hi all! I'm Gary, from Norwich, UK..
Anyway a little about my past!
Well It all started from a young age at about 6 when I thought my throat was closing up for ages on end, went to the doctors several times and they said everything was fine and I got over it eventually
Then When I was 10-11 I had some major panic attacks which on one I passed out, got taken to hospital and they done some tests and found 'irregular' brain waves, and diagnosed me with Epilepsy, I took the medication but my parents were never convinced I had epilepsy and that it was just panic attacks, So i came off the meds and never had a full 'fit' """"""""passed out"""""""" again..
Then when I wad 13 I dropped out of school with depression, severe anxiety and could not leave my house for about 6 months without having a panic attack. Anyway enough of the past :blushing:
when I was younger I did have quite a few rituals I had to do, Like count my stairs everytime i went up them, go up them with my right foot on the first step.. And I had to Rub the light switch before bed even if the light was on, Dont know if everyone gets this type of thing, but when I look back I realize maybe that was a little OCD.
So about a year ago, I started having horrible thoughts about harming other people, mainly my loved ones and this really upset me and caused depression, at one point I remember saying to my dad the only way out was to kill myself. It all started after I watched a horror movie type thing.
These thoughts go round and round in my head and i'm constantly fighting them, they always hit me when everything is going great, like now.. In a great relationship, have a great family and a job. They seem to come in phases, sometimes I can brush them off, other times they really affect me.
My latest thought started a few weeks ago, we drove past a prison, and my partner said jokingly """"""""you belong in there"""""""" well ever since then I have been obsessing about prison, its really scary and irrational but it won't go away.
This probably does not make much sense, just interested to see if you think this is OCD or I am actually a nut case I do feel like one sometimes.
Thanks to anyone who read this, and i will hopefully be about on here quite a bit.
Gary
PS. I have had ALOT of councelling and therapy for my depression and anxiety, but never spoke t anyone about the thoughts as I find it hard to speak about it, Although I can speak to my dad about them, as he suffers from the same sort of thing as me.","['Medication', 'drop', 'Rituals', 'interest', 'hope', 'anxiety', 'anxiety', 'OCD', 'depression', 'Thought']",['irrational'],"['anxiety', 'OCD', 'drop', 'depression', 'interest', 'Thought', 'Rituals', 'irrational', 'Medication', 'hope']",,1.0,,,
"This is the first time, I have ever written on a forum of any kind. I suppose its because i have never had anything to really write about. I have been finding things quite hard to cope with lately, despite having an amazing boyfriend, who loves me a lot.
i have found it hard to stop washing my hands after doing the simpliest things, I have no idea what starts meoff. i know I have got really anxious about things this year and I think that may have something to do with. i have also got really lonely. my hands are dry, cracked and hurt quite a lot. I feel like I have changed into somebody I don't want to be and hate myself. i have irrational thoughts and have a go at people that I love the most.
i just want to stop. #I am trying my best to get on top of things, but i even start worrying about transferring ferms all over my house and turning the taps on with dnot clean hands and then turning them off with clean hands. The thoughts like that are irrational and a bit silly, I admit. i know there are micro-organisms everywhere and a bit of dirt never hurt anyone. I just can't help myself and I really want to.....

I even worr about using toilets in work or other places, because of not knowing how clean they. I feel really alone sometimes..

"This is really hard to describe, and it doesn't really make sense. I tried explaining to my best friend and she just keeps telling me that I should see my doctor if it hurts, which normally would seem like sound advice but I don't think it really applies in this case.
When I was little, if something touched or brushed or whatevered one of my wrists, I would have to touch or scratch or rub or whatever my other wrist to even out the feeling. Like, whatever it was that touched my wrist first would somehow """"""""change"""""""" how it felt, and my wrists would feel different, so I would have to do the same thing to the other wrist to make them both feel the same again. I don't know the exact age this started because I literally have been doing this for as long as I can remember, but it seems that it happens more frequently now, and I don't need something to touch me first. It's not just with my wrists anymore, but also between my fingers and toes and the first line on my fingers, my ankles, elbows, and corners of my eyes. Every now and then I'll get a random """"""""feeling"""""""" in my wrist, and I'll have to scratch the sides of that wrist to get the feeling to go away, and then the other wrist as well, and then the sides of the first line on all of my fingers, and then between my fingers too. Sometimes it's on an ankle, and then I scratch the sides of that ankle and then the other ankle and then my toes as well. Or sometimes I'll get it in the corner of my eye, and then I have to rub both corners of one eye, and then the other eye. Usually after scratching or rubbing whatever feels weird, the feeling goes away and I can carry on with whatever I was doing. But sometimes it gets really bad and it's everything all at once; my wrists, fingers, ankles, toes, elbows, eyes... everything feels weird at the same time and no matter what I do the weird feeling keeps coming back. 
The thing is, it's not a real feeling. I mean, there's nothing actually going on physically. Like I'm not actually feeling anything. But I can still feel something. If that makes sense.. For the past few days it's gotten bad at night and earlier today as well when I was driving home (5 hour drive), which made it especially annoying. Like I could almost cry because of how frustrating it is that it won't just stop. I try to ignore it sometimes and hope that the feeling will pass but it never does, and it just makes me feel anxious and makes it hard to breathe almost. 
I do a thing with my fingernails and the skin around my nails where I pick at them and bite them to try to """"""""fix"""""""" them, but I think that's probably dermatophagia so that may be unrelated to whatever this is.
I know this isn't really a good explanation, but I don't know how to explain it. It's hard to describe what a non-existent feeling feels like. I really don't want to be disrespectful to anyone who actually has OCD, but I have no idea what else this might be. I don't have any rituals, I don't hoard anything, I'm not super conscious of germs.. so maybe this isn't OCD at all and I'm just weird. But if it is maybe OCD I'd like to know so that maybe I could do something about it.
I'm not asking for a diagnosis, just opinions! Please tell me what you think, if there's a chance this could possibly be OCD or on the OCD Spectrum (if that exists), or if this isn't OCD at all. Thank you. xo","['hope', 'Rituals', 'OCD']",[],"['Rituals', 'hope', 'OCD']",,1.0,,,
"Hi, im new to this forum.
I am a sufferer of OCD, I have only been like this for nearly two years and its ruining my life. Im 20 years old and feel
like my life is being washed down the drain.
My fear is germs so I avoid eating certain foods, seeling my family and friends (apart from my mum), having people in the house
people touching me or my things, amongst the washing of hands and other things.
I wouldnt say im an agrophobe but I will only go out as far as the shops around the corner and thats in the car
im reluctant to drive out further. and im affraid to go out alone, i always go out with my mum.
My family are becoming so frustrated with me, I feel like they dont even like me anymore. I dont feel like im getting
much constructive help, and they tend to insult me about my problem and can be quite offensive as though its my
fault, when it isnt my fault im like this, it just happened to me.
I have tried counselling with 2 people so far (CBT) and both were no good (Im paying for i private)
Im not sure where to go from here I feel so lost?
Both times i have not continued with the counselling my family become so frustrated with me and angry, but i refuse to continue
to pay £40 an hour for someone who wasnt really doing their job properly and I felt no different.
I did consider getting another one but my mum said it will just take to long to have counselling now and she
dont have time to wait around for me to get better.
(I wont take any meds)
I hope someone can offer some support/advice or something

"I'm a 20 year old girl living in halls and studying my first year at university. I was (reluctantly) diagnosed with OCD about 2/3 years ago. My doctor was unsympathetic and old fashioned and assumed I was fine, just over reacting, or hormonal I think. He made me feel uncomfortable, seemed like he couldn't be bothered to listen to me and it was hard to talk about my feelings, but none the less I have OCD and was referred to see a counsellor for a little while, but I found the lady very hard to talk to and it was not helpful and made me feel weird so I gave it up and tried to deal with things myself. For a while I thought I was doing well, until recently, I have realised actually, I'm not. The only person I feel comfortable talking to is my boyfriend of 5 years, but I feel like I'm turning him into my therapist lately and it isn't fair on him. I feel selfish and guilty because he's trying to get me to make a doctors appointment but I'm so scared of admitting to a stranger. Since the last time I went to the doctor, he retired so it would be someone new, but I'm still worried about what will happen - my mother and stepdad don't ever talk to me about it, and my real dad doesn't even know anything about it because I'm so embarrassed by it all.
I feel anxious for no reason a lot of the time, at night I lie awake with a fast beating heart and can't work out why, I try to make it slow down by breathing, but find it doesn't really help.
I feel on edge and tearful most of the time and my boyfriend admitted to me the other day he can't remember the last time I didn't have a day when I didn't get upset and ring him up crying saying that I feel crappy for no reason. I feel so guilty because I feel like I shouldn't worry him constantly with my problems and I should be happy because I don't honestly have anything to cry about, but I just feel down and helpless lately. My friends family and boyfriend would feel awful if they thought I felt this down so often and I feel guilty worrying them.
I have certain rituals before bed, like checking plugs, checking the cooker is off, the fridge is shut and there are no spiders in the room etc and I do things like brushing my teeth while repeatedly counting to 12. I have more strange habits that I can't remember and I also do things throughout the day to ease anxiety. I worry that if I don't do these things bad things will happen, like my loved ones dying and I can't cope with the guilt if I try not to give into them.
The thing I am perhaps most stressed out by is something I have tried to deal with for a year by myself without even telling my boyfriend. Last year I was at a festival where a band covered the Black eyed peas song 'where is the love' where the lyrics are 'people killing, people dying' - since then I started having this really horrible thought of ''what if I'm a future killer, and don't know about it? what if I go crazy one day and hurt someone?'' I'm so disgusted by myself for these thoughts because its wrong, and this is the thing I am dreading telling a doctor the most. What if they think I actually am a murderer? I'm scared to admit that I have these thoughts because they might section me or lock me away. I have never, nor would I EVER hurt ANYONE, but these horrible thoughts are making me suffer and feel panicky. I'm starting to hate myself and I'm scared to sleep at night in case I hurt someone. I feel like the worst person in the world and I don't deserve to live.
I feel self conscious and just generally worried about what people think of me, so I'm terrified of telling a doctor because I'm so embarrassed and disgusted with myself, I feel unbelievably guilty, and feel I don't deserve anything.
I just don't know what to do, I don't feel like my old self because I think it has gradually gotten worse without me really realising and I feel so helpless and I am worried I will start to destroy my relationship with my boyfriend if I don't get help. I am petrified of telling a doctor all of the above because they are such cold, clinical unsympathetic people. I would NEVER commit suicide because I care too much about what would happen to my loved ones and I feel like there should be more to life than this, but I just think sometimes it would be easier than this. I just want to feel better and happier without so much worry clouding everything.

I have some good news. Some how I found an inner strength and defeated a lot of my ocd. I just told myself no, and stopped doing quite a few rituals. I still have some issues like bins and contamination from people.

I gave him the phone, he just kept fiddling in his pocket for a knife, but someone was walking towards us so he didnt get any money.
In a way I'm not putting it down to ocd. In fact I hadnt even thought about it til about half an hour ago. I dont even know why I'm writing this. I'm worried my ocd will win me over here.
I cried at first which seemed pathetic over a phone. The guy who was walking by called the police and I'm giving a full statement tomorrow. But in a way its like I'm acting fine around everyone saying its ok and I'll go back there on Monday, as I go there nearly everyday of the week to get to uni and work and to my boyfriends house.
But I'm so scared. I don't seem able to go more than 5 minutes without thinking about it and then my heart starts racing and I get anxious and almost angry, I want to find him and hurt him so badly. I didnt think I'd react like this. My boyfriend has a thing that my folks dont like him and I was also really upset that he has the nerve to say he loves me and yet didnt come and see me after, and then called me spoilt because my dad said he'd buy me a new phone.
I don't need the problems with him. Its weird I was sitting down when it happened, which makes it easier for people to intimidate you, but when I go there I rarely ever sit down. I wish I hadn't.
Truth is I'm terrified, that moment he said he had a knife it was like everything slowed down and my heart sped up.

"I'm afraid of getting another OCD spike to ruminate on today.
I've been feeling better about my incest thoughts, and have been moving on to what I deem more reasonable worries, with OCD trying to barge in here and there, but not about the incest thoughts.
But this morning when I was with my boyfriend's mom in the car, we passed the high school and I saw my little brother, in which, my boyfriend's mom honked the horn, and I proceeded to wave at him like a crazed maniac. He just stared at us puzzled, gave a little half wave back, and kept walking.
That whole scenario this morning is just the kind of material that could fuel my OCD and I'm worried, because today, I have to be by myself.
How do I stop this before it starts completely?","['Thought', 'OCD']",['spike'],"['Thought', 'spike', 'OCD']",1.0,,,,
"Hi guys,
Im a bit shocked after watching a tv programme today which only prooved how low is mental health awareness in my country. It was a progaramme on a commercial tv channel that usually evolves around some shocking news and is looking for scandals in lifes of regular people. The so-called journalists are ment to help people with their problems, bringing some information on their issues to the public attention.The title of the programme in English is 'Attention!'
Today the programme was focused on an elderly woman with obvious hoarding ocd, that created unbearable living situation for herself as well as for their neighbours because of her hoarding. Trash from garbage cans and all sort of junk piled up in her flat from the floor to the ceilling causing unbearable stink and invasion of cockroaches and all sort of insects. She lived like that for the last 20 or more years, of course with her hoarding rituals gradually getting worse. Landloards had to forcefully remove the junk once a month because it was starting to fill the shared areas of the block of flats.
For me it was an obvious, in-my-face example of severe ocd. Though through the whole, hour-long tv programme ocd was not one mentioned! And generally noone talked about mental health or the possiblity in which one could help that poor, controled by ocd and lonely women! They only seemed to be looking for a good-selling scandal and it seemed as if they attacked the women which is herself, a victim. What she did with the trash seemed to be for them her 'elderly habit' or her 'lack of good will'. She lived alone and from what i know has no family relatives. The hoarding got so bad that landlords had to cut of gas,water and electricity in her flat for safety reasons. So she lives alone with no gas, electricity, water with her tons of garbage and her OCD and at nights she looks through local trash cans to collect some more - and- gets no help for her state from the authorities or social care!!!
What worries me the most is that probably noone recognized her as an OCD sufferer. I knew there was little mental health-awarness in my country but i didnt know it was to this extent! Noone, nor their neighbours, nor the social care intended to get her to see a specialist, though -so obviously- she had a mental health condition that needed to be treated. Everyone aroun including the interviewed neighbours, social care workers and journalists themself seemed to think that she just 'likes' hoarding trash! It havent even occured to their narrow minds that she might be suffering from some mental health disorder and that this disorder is named OCD.
I was so shocked after the report and felt so incredibly sorry for the women that i immediatelly called the editor willing to enlight her about OCD and suggest that maybe the women should talk with a mental health proffessional. Unfortunately it was after working hours so only a fax machine answered so im willing to call again tomorrow.
I just needed to share this piece of information with you guys. Forgive me my frustration but i just feel that living in Poland is like living in the darkest, dumb and most indifferent place on the Planet! Noone here even heard about OCD apart from a few psychiatrists and maybe some sufferers themselves that were lucky enough to get properly diagnosed. And it scares me that there may be so many people just like this women that not only are not receiving any help for OCD but that are not even aware that they have it. I bet something like that would never happen in the UK for ecxample.
Anyway, tommorrow im intending to call again. I really would like that women to receive some direct treatment for OCD, her living conditions were hell. Hopefully her state would improve if only a qualified person looked after her. Im sure putting her on some medication wouldnt do her any harm. Of course im in no such power to help her get to the doctor, but i hope that these scandalmongers(journalists) will have enough heart to provide the social care some tips on how to help her(and that for Gods sake they will take her to the doctor!)
Take care all xxx i hope youll have an ocd-free day :cool:

"Hi!
I just got to borrow a laptop and im so glad that i can finally write- yesterday i just had a phone. and i couldnt sign in. i still found some comfort reading your threads- you mean alot to me. when i got money i think i will be a member of ocd uk and try and give something back. cause this forum means so much to me, and i really missed being able to write with you.
alot happened the last few days, i dont know if im going to write every detail, cause its difficult to me- wanna move on.
i got kicked out of the appartment in two days as i wrote before- then i lived by a friend in two days, and yesterday i moved in to a new appartment-
its was hard staying at a friend with all thatt stress and server contamination ocd. she had two kids, a baby and a four year old. i had to reduce my showering and handwash- and conpulsions- i actually dont know how i coped. i slept on the caouch in the livingroom, and had no free zone. i was afraid the fouryearold would touch me. and afraid to get triggered by tv. i got a trigger one day and didnt get to shower and .. it was so exhausting,,
now- i got a new place, i really didnt have much of a choice being homeless- i took what i got- its not in my city. i dont know anyone well round here. i dont have money until next month, so i borrowed to food and the things i need. borrowed sheet from my friend.
when i came here i got a bad suprise-, my appartment is in 2 floor. but when i asked where the toilet were.he showed me that it was down a stair and throgh a shared area. i dont have bathroom in my floor!!!! this caused me alot of anxiety yesterday. cause i shower a lot, and its one of the last things i do before i go to bed. i feel the bed have to be clean. so i shower, and dont touch anything on my way from shower to the bed. i dont even touch door handles. i use toilet paper or something clean to touch and close the door and dont walk on the floor- i walk on a towel or use clean socks as i take off without touching underneath them, were they been in contact with yhe floor. this is how my nighttime rituals have been kije- and if something went wrong or i touched aanything conteminated i had to shower again.
now... i get a problem. i cant walk naked through the commen area (even if i actually given it a thought(.
yesterday i had no dry clean socks or towel and tryed to be good- i desided to try sleep without showering. i feel my sheet are conteminated now,
i did sleep finaly- but in top of feeling conteminaded its listen her- like you can sometimes hear what they say in 1 floor, well i get triggered off some words, and never do anything triggering in bed or listen to the radio. i was so anxious listening to them talking, afraid to be triggered to do conpulsions. i put my fingers in my ears and got up and took some extra meds and sleeping pills- and got to sleep finaly,
before i got out of bed this morning it were really high music and talking- maybe his guest slept over- i really hope its not goiing to be like this, noicy and triggering- and i really struggeling findin out how to cope with the new bathroom.
yesterday i was also afraid by the thoght someone unknown can just walk into my bathroom and conteminate things without me knowing.
its btw very small and not fit for ocd. it gets so steamy and i have to open the glas, witch alsp is difficult- cause i have to touch it.
i try to be brave and use my new appartment as a oppertunity to touch cranes, and things i used to use papir to touch- but i really dont know if i can do it anymore.
i touched my shoe. cause i didnt get it on withot, and freaked out cause i link the shoes to the doorhandle in the last appartment with i were so afraid off- anyway if i ruminate now i guess i feel most things are conteminated already.
and even the things i havent touched.. i washed some cloaths in the washing mashine and when they were dry i didnt knew were to put them, cause no place felt safe and clean enogh.
i try to work with my ocd. but dont know how much i can push myself- i think it might be easier to work now then when my ocd has really settled down. still i feel really anxious, unsafe and lonely.
i dont know whats happeniing, if my boyfriend and me is ever going to get together. i dont know if im going to try to live here or find something i like better, maybe in my city.
i feel so unsafe, so anxious. and im really happy to be able to write to you. maybe you understand how its like to move to a place were you have to find a new way to cope, were everything feels unsafe- and i really want advice and support to be strong and progress on my ocd even if i go trogh my nightmare.
thamks for reading my messy post.

"I guess everyone with OCD but I always worry about surfing the net and accidentally going to a website that has tracking malware and what not. Now I hear that things like IPhones and such are meant to be safe but if I get redirected somewhere while say reading the news, I get amazingly anxious and panic and want to completely reset my device to prevent me from being compromised. I think this would be deemed excessive but I feel like I can't cope without it. The problem I find with things like this is the what if factor. Like, if I do nothing and I get scammed because of my recklessness. It seems stupid that just reading a news site can get me into trouble but it almost makes me not want to not use the Internet. The problem is that if I start that logic, soon I'll be avoiding everything. I think I'm going to try and do something like clear my cookie downloads and then tell myself I'm fine. Try and convince myself that all is okay.","['OCD', 'site']",['excessive'],"['site', 'excessive', 'OCD']",,1.0,,,
"I know I've posted on the forum for the past couple of days. But this time I'm truly panicking. 
I felt fine today didn't feel anxious about any spikes; but that all had to be ruined. 
I was watching a reality tv show with a guy who identified as gay. Now I was watching him on the show and he stated that he had cheated on every girlfriend he had with a guy. He later burst into tears feeling guilty about it and his friend told him that he was figuring out his sexuality. 
Now I'm panicked. Because I don't believe this is ocd. 
Ive tried to believe it for two and a half years. I genuinely believe that im just in denial. I wanted to make sure I wasn't. That's why I posted wanting to know what denial really is, what it feels like. 
Like in the past I knew I was straight. I was sure if it. I liked guys and I was never shy about it but I had never been in a serious relationship and was really terrified really. (Maybe a sign?) But it was something I imagined every single day and I liked it. I looked forward to that point in my life when I found a guy that I loved and have a family and a great career. That's what I guess motivated me in everything I did. It's stupid I know, but to me it just was something I wanted, and I based my whole life on. 
But this worry turned up in a random dream. I didn't enjoy it. I woke up feeling really weird and panicked about why I dreamt about it. I remember the panick and trying to work it out. And then seeing a really attractive guy in a film and thinking see it's fine, and then I felt good about myself and thinking I'm so stupid! But obviously it continued. Then the checking. And the memories were one of the worst things. The worst was my first kiss. I was terrified that not feeling 'sparks' when a guy quickly pecked me meant something- even though there was a group of kids standing around us and telling me to do it, and having no clue. 
But that's just an excuse someone in denial would say that. I was so panicked about it I even asked my friends. One said that it didn't matter, and the others said that there's weren't amazing either so I felt better. But again, I then hear others talk about how amazing it was and I didn't have that so it must mean something. It must do. 
It's the simple things I miss the most. Stuff like watching movies and tv are effort because I associated an old tv show to when I wasn't panicking and I felt okay, and I feel awful. To add that I can't even confidently find a guy attractive anymore. I used to take that for granted and I wish I could time travel back and really appreciate it. 
I think I like to make things look like OCD so I don't have to let that person go. I do find myself holding the years before 2015 on a pedestal. I would honestly trade this to worry about anything else. Absolutely anything else! I would rather convince myself that I was 6ft again, I would rather again constantly measure myself and create markings and spend hours guessing people's heights and getting upset about something so stupid than this. 
I would give anything to go back and never fall asleep that night. 
And that's awful because I've got a great life. I have a supportive family, amazing opportunities ahead of me. And I'm still thinking of this. Sometimes I don't panick. But everyday it makes it way in. And I want a day where I don't think about it. 
I'm so sorry for the ramble. I really am. And I'm sorry for my attitude on the forum. I guess I'm back to the beginning again. I hope someone understands","['guilt', 'joy', 'checking', 'fall', 'hope', 'OCD']",['spike'],"['OCD', 'fall', 'checking', 'joy', 'spike', 'hope', 'guilt']",1.0,,,,
"So I finally got past my sharing a bed with my partner fears, just in time to go to norfolk with him amping this weekend.
but..There's something new :'(
I used to get the HIV fears, just like most people on this forum, anyway at the time I was having these fears I visited Cardiff one day to visit the Doctor Who exhibition (was really good)
But then on the way home this man walked towards me and almost bumped into me (it looked like he was doing it deliberately) but because I saw him coming I twisted out of the way. For Ages after however I was convinced He stabbed me in the back with a HIV needle.
Some time ago I got over this fear, I realised it was a stupid fear and very unlikely to have happened.
Then out of the blue the other day when me and my boyfriend were making love it popped back into my head.
and now its all I can think about. I'm so afraid that I have had HIV all this time and was just kidding myself when I thought I didn't have it.
I'm really scared that I have passed it on to my boyfriend and maybe some other people...
I don't know if I should get tested or if I should try and get over it again.

"I want to write so much here, I've been in Hell for as long as I can remember, and my turning point was when I was going to loose the love of my life because of me! whats going on? I had a panic attack that lasted for seven weeks and that was just the start, then I went on to spend a year telling my man I had to leave him because I had mental problems I couldnt sort out, so I would drive him mad by asking him to hate me & would he leave me, but I couldnt let him go, cos I love his, then that one passed and then it was, I love him I hate AAAAALLLLL the time for two years.
I havent worked for over three years now and no one or anything has worked. I've just wanted to kill myself, well Ive forgotten how many times I got that low, but it was a few. Then one day I had enough and thought Im going to pay to & see someone, because everyone that i had seen through my GP I didnt click with, It even got that bad that I thought I wasnt breathing and I told my shrink that I was seeing at the time, and she just laughed at me, and that just put me down even more, so as I was saying, Ive paid to see this woman that I am still seeing her now, and shes great, she has saved me. She does this relaxation thing with me at the end of each session, were I can go to my safe place, and this was great for me cos I started to relax, and she also does this thing which is called rewind and play, which is from """"""""Human givens"""""""", which is worth a look up, back to the rewind and play, she takes me to my safe place and in my safe place she gets me to watch a problem I have on a tv screen and Ive to rewind and play it, and Ive to do this a few times, and the whole thing is designed to take bad thoughts and memories from the negative store of your brain and put it in the normal thought part, it has helped me with loads of my problems. One day I said to her I feel I have OCD of the brain, until a few months ago I thought OCD was washing your hands all the time & making sure the door was locked on a grand scale, but one day I went to the library and looked up OCD, and it was then I felt I was home!!!!! and the panics after a week stopped, because when I read you can learn to live with it, it was then that I realised that all my thoughts are not me, and I had proof and since reading about OCD I tell myself its not me, and Im stronger, and yes I still have my bad days and need to cry to get that release, & my man doesnt reasure me 24 7 anymore!! and another thought is life is easy compaired to OCD, so Ive started to pick up the pieces again and Im doing my painting, and Im gong to live with OCD and have a life, there is loads of things I cant do, but Im making the steps to having a happy life on the outside and put my boxing gloves on to everytime the thoughts come back.
Well Im sorry for my bad spelling and grammer, but Im really really glad this site is here, & Im not and your not alone.

"Hi,
I have posted a few times before about the same thing (I have quoted and pasted below). I don't know what to do anymore, I'm such a mess.I don't know how to move forward from the bad things I did. I can't stand that I made my dog fearful and to think that she was scared whenever we approached her and went to stroke her makes me want to cry my eyes out. I keep picturing her body language, I don't know how to feel better. I can't do anything to make up for this poor little wasted life spent being anxious and scared.
I haven't been able to concentrate at work today, I have spent all day searching the internet for information on submissive dogs to try to find out if I made her overly submissive and scared, which I know I did but I am trying to prove myself wrong. I'm actually sat at work doing this now and crying.
What can I do? Please help.

Hey everyone,
First of all I want to say a massive thankyou to all the wonderfully kind people that replied to my post (below). I appreciate all of your kind words and examples of your own experiences. I'm still ruminating on the subject evry day, what I did seems (at least to me) so much worse than what other people did, (for example, physically reprimanding my lovely dog probably on a daily basis, her not getting nearly enough walks- also when she went on walks she would get so far and stop- I don't know if she would not walk on because she was scared of the outdoors because she did not get enough walks or if was the burglary at my house that made her more fearful in general). I don't know if in my head I think it's worse than it is or if it is just factual that it is really bad. I feel I ruined my dogs life and made her overly submissive and fearful. I don't feel that I should be allowed to carry on as normal and have a happy life when my dog was denied this. I feel I should be punished in some way.
Can anyone recommend how I should move forward? Is there any reading material on how to accept bad things you did?
Thanks evryone
This is my original post
""""""""Hi,
I just wanted to ask for opinions, I beg you not be too harsh on me, I already don't like myself. I did some bad things and I don't knot how to accept what I did. Does anyone had any ideas about how to cope with guilt? Also, I am unsure if I have hyper-responsibility OCD, as I have spent the majority of the past month ruminating and analysing over and over again about the issue below (also on and off for the past couple of years) and I have vast experience of doing this with other themes . I'm not sure If I'm using the hyper-responsibility thing as an excuse to not feel so gulity. And when I don't feel guilty, I feel guilty about my lack of guilt.
A bit of info on my past- I have obsessively worried about my own short comings and suffered periods of depression since I was around 12- this is the first period of constant sadness and real low self worth that I can remember (I don't think I had much confidence before this age also). This has happended many times, and now I am in my mid 20's. I remember a period of being terrified of hurting a member of my family who I love more than anyone. It is only in the past year that my affliction has been diagnosed as OCD, since I have seen a therapist. My OCD ruminations went into overdrive a couple of years ago when a relationship ended. I would constantly think of all the things I did wrong, if I was abnormal and what was wrong with me, I would spend all day arguing against these negative thoughts. Not long after, my beloved dog of 17 years passed away.I feel like a complete hypocrite writing this as she deserved so, so much better.
The big 'hot topic' or theme- We got her (a Yorkshire Terrier) when I was around 7 or 8 years old and I always loved her very much. I was devastated when she died and still miss her. Throughout her life up until her being fairly old I would run around after her, tease and torment her (one incident I've been thinking of is a time when I flicked some playing cards in her face, I guess because I was bored and wanted to see what she would do or something). I would now and again chase her around with balloons because she was scared of them. Once I made it so she would hit/bump her head on a table because I suppose I thought it would be funny- it wasn't hard or anything and I dont think it would've hurt much really but I still hate myself for it, I flicked her ear a few times, would dress her up in dolls clothes. I would squeak her toys in her face to get her to play with me, I really hope it never hurt her ears but I guess I didn't really think about this or care about this at the time). I've tried to tell myself that loads of kids do stuff like that to their pets but I feel like I'm so evil for doing stuff like this.
Also when I was younger I would smack her probably on a daily basis(probably sometimes too hard I think) if she did something 'wrong' (like going to the toilet on the floor, or excessively barking at people through the window or at the gate), maybe I learned to do this as I saw my parents do it as a discipline technique. She would do something 'wrong', it wouldn't particularly bother me but sometimes I would choose to be the one to go and ''discipline' her by giving her a smack or shouting at her- I think I did it sometimes just to get out a bit of frustration, or to have a sense of be control I guess in a life where I didn't have much confidence and a lack of control. She always seemed submissive and would lower her head when you went to stroke her, she would assume sumissive body language (avoid eye contact, ears down etc) when you greeted her or went up to her. Even when she was being submissive I would still give her a smack when she did something perceived as 'wrong', again as a discipline thing- but she hadn't done anything particularly bad eg, barking through the window at people going past. Now I am older I now know that she was just being a dog and wasn't doing anything wrong. I cant live with myself that I caused her to be scared or unhappy for 17 years. I think that what I did was pretty bad and not many crimes would measure up in regards to the affect on another life.
I really really hope I am exaggerating the affect I had on my dog and I hope I by ruminating I am remembering it much worse than it was. I recall a time when I went to get her in from the porch where she was barking at passers by and I gave her a smack for barking, and my mum said """"""""she only gets her in so she can smack her"""""""". This memory makes me feel sick to my stomach. For my mum to say this I suppose I must've smacked her often for her to notice this.
She was a submissive dog, to think she lived in fear because of me makes me hate myself. I ruminate over what my dad said about the buglary at our home- that they must've kicked her or something- I think he must've noticed a difference in her afterwards (I was about 11 or 12 years old so can't really remember my dogs behaviour before the break in), I tell myself that if she was scared it was prob the burglary but I just go round and round eg- what if he can't remember clearly etc. I have spent so much time on the internet looking for info about submissive dogs and behaviour when I should be working. I worry that my boss will question me about this.
She would always be happy to see me when I got home, she'd be jumping around (although she did greet with submissive body language at first) and excited and she would run upstairs to sleep with me on my bed. I try to excuse my behaviour by telling myself that it was the break in that made her overly submissive but this just leads to more rumination.
I think around my later teens I matured and thought its cruel to do this sort of thing, I wouldn't smack her or particularly tease much. Maybe when I was younger I didn't realise it was wrong, I remember a few times someone or another would say 'aww you shouldn't do that its cruel' if I was chasing her around or teasing her. I didn't really take it in. I suppose I thought I'm loving her and don't think I'm hurting her. Also she didn't go for any where near enough walks, I suppose being young when we got her I didn't want to take on that responsibility and as I got older I just got used to it being that way. I've read that yorkshire terriers dont need much exercise and are happy to potter around the garden. I've been reading up on yorkshire terriers and dog behaviour to try to make myself feel better but I dont think I even deserve to feel better or have a clear conscience.
It sounds silly but I really did love her like a baby, I would come home from uni and couldnt wait to pick her up and stroke her and I hated leaving her when I had to go back to uni. She had to have an operation about a year before she passed away and I was so upset she might not make it, then when she did I stayed there with her and did what I could to make sure she was looked after and comfortable. I also keep thinking back to the time when we fist got her and she went for her vaccinations she let out a little squeal and for some reason I laughed. I dont know if I just thought it was a funny noise or something because I never liked to see her pain. Why would I laugh? I can only think that there is something quite wrong with me and I am not a nice person. Please tell me, how can I possibly make up for doing wrong to this innocent little soul? She is the happiest memories I have and I cant live with this guilt. To picture her little face makes me want to cry. To read about animal cruelty makes me so angry, so to think I did this- I don't know how to move past it or if I deserve to carry this around with me.

"Hi everyone
Those who know me know i have a fear of contamination that has obviously morphed into different rituals over the years. I have a huge fear of the toilet and germs that are to do with that, so also anyone who works with that sort of thing ie builders,plumbers i will not go anywhere near and they certainly don't come near my house. I also up until a month back would not go in a supermarket if there was a van of any description in the carpark but now i will, unless it is a plumbers van then i won't yet but im never saying never. I do not let my 4 year old use the toilet at home, even though he is toilet trained and uses it at school and everywhere else i just don't let him go in the bathroom except for baths and i use a jug to go to the toilet because i won't go near the toilet at all. Our bathroom carpet is also mouldy where ben has splashed water out and it needs replacing but i can't do it at the moment because it would mean someone else going near my toilet and hence making them contaminated too and wot if they touched my handrail coming downstairs
I started cbt back in october and was really apprehensive about it because i had never got any further than the assessment session. I have had quite a few sessions now mostly on a weekly basis but not always. The tasks myself and my therapist agreed on were very small the first time it was to take my son in the bath when he got home from school (he is 4) and then not take him in again before bed as i was doing. I managed this quite well and it was less stress at bedtime too, especially as i have 2 children (the other is 1). Then it was to see if i could cope with having my sister and mum round for a cup of tea as i haven't had anyone in my house except myself and my husband and children for 2 years. I didn't do it the first week, but when we had our last session before christmas we decided i should give it another go. So the next week i rang my sister and asked if she and my nephew would like to come round for a bit. Now the Gemma before wouldn't of let my nephew play with any of my sons toys and i would of put towels on the chairs so my sister wasen't in direct contact, but I didn't. I rang my therapist when i had invited my sister and told her how sick i was feeling about the whole thing and she said it would be excellent if i could do it but not to be too hard on myself if i couldn't. Well guess what folks she came round that day and the next day for dinner. Then she came yesterday and today too, and i have invited my nephew to stay tomorrow night which is a big big thing for me though i have told him he has to use the potty to go the toilet because i don't want them in the bathroom.
I had upped my meds before starting cbt to the maximum dosage and have found this is helping immensely.
I am hoping that the next thing will be to have a new bathroom carpet fitted so my son can start using the toilet and so can people that come to visit instead of having to hold it in (heehee).
So i hope that i can keep on this positive path and succeed against this awful thing they call ocd, after 18 years i certainly hope so. Don't give up anyone keep at it. I thought that when you went to cbt they made you do things and you had no choice, you couldn't say no. But i was told by someone that they cannot make you do anything you don't want to and when i said this in a session the therapist confirmed this which made the whole thing easier to stick with rather than giving up for the umpteenth time. I think it makes it easier to keep at it because of my two children and the fact i want them to have normal lives without a weird mummy who won't let them invite friends over.

"This week is OCD Awareness Week, and each day we will be publishing a different account of Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder.
Today Connie @connectoutsider - The Connected Outsider wrote this fantastic piece that perfectly illustrates our efforts during OCD Awareness Week to help people understand the impact of OCD.
Imagine having a health condition that kept you confined to your home.
Imagine that it stopped you from being around people.
Imagine a condition that kept you tied to constant rituals and exhausted you both mentally and physically.
Imagine it kept you awake at night and prevented you from working.
Imagine the condition you suffered from was so debilitating and disabling that the World Health Organisation (WHO) ranked it in the top ten of the most disabling illnesses of any kind, in terms of lost earnings and diminished quality of life.
Imagine being made to fight to get the treatment you desperately needed. 
Imagine your health condition was often treated as a 'joke' and something to poke fun at. 
Imagine nobody understanding what you go through because of the misconceptions surrounding your condition.
Imagine not being able to talk to your friends and family about it because of the lack of understanding.
For 1.2% of the population this is often the reality. These are the people who live with Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD).

"Hi,
For the past week or so I've had this horrible spike of imagining myself dead or dying. I've been scared that due to the tablets im taking (clomipramine) that it was suicidal thoughts though I now think it's a bit different to that.
I have a strong desire for life and look forward to a bright future (even though things are tough right now). My OCD keeps making me think what it would be like if I just stopped living though. Has anybody else experienced this? Almost testing myself to see if id like it. Feeling weak and confused right now.

"Hello !
I have just bought 'the imp pf the mind' book yesterday, but im now frightened to read it! I have pure o and have decided to take control and arm myself with knowledge to help me overcom it.
However - i think that the OCD is mad and is making me scared to read it!. This is all because i read the blog on the back of the book, which was along the lines of ''how to know which thoughts are harmles and which are dangerous''.
I am now scared to read it incase it confirms to me that my thoughts are the dangerous ones. I know that this is what spike wants (thats what i call my ocd gremlin!!). because it means that he retains control.
Should i just bite the bullet and read it anyway? Has anyone else experianced worrys similar?
Thanks

"Hi. Saz here (real name is Sarah).
I am new here and just wanted to introduce my particular problems, with an emphasis on the so called 'Imp of the Perverse' - when you get the urge to do or say the complete opposite to what is appropriate!!
I have suffered from OCD (and a bit of Tourette's) now for 30 years, but got an increased insight into the problem only a couple of years ago (there is always something new to learn).
Up until I was about 19, my symptoms were mostly noticeable as rituals like touching, checking and counting to ward off horrible things happening - I didn't have much insight for a long time, and found it hard to resist these rituals.
But then I got the urge to tell people who mattered about things I'd done of which they wouldn't approve, and the effort to keep it in made me physically sick. I worried about needing to go to the loo when I couldn't escape to do so, or of vomiting at inappropriate times (at the dinner table; at the dentist - I once got so worked up I spewed on the table in MacDonald's), and I also worried about getting inappropriate thoughts, especially of a sexual nature. In addition to the physiological response of nausea, I also fear getting the physiological sensation of sexual arousal when it doesn't seem appropriate or isn't wanted (isn't it strange - we don't worry so much about crying when we're happy, or laughing when we're nervous, although these, too are physiological responses). These symptoms spread terribly, to everything. I'm much better now, but still worry I may dream something or think something and get the urge to tell someone about it who would not approve (only people who matter to me, like my parents). I wash my hands a lot when preparing food for others but this is not a cleaning ritual - I'm just terrified I'll confess to them later that I made it after picking my nose or something!
This is getting a bit long. I'll end off with: Who else identifies with my worst problem??

PITTSBURGH TRIBUNE-REVIEW
Wednesday, July 21, 2010
A brain implant could help patients with obsessive compulsive disorder get rid of nervous habits the illness triggers, doctors at Allegheny General Hospital said Tuesday.
The battery-operated device is similar to a heart pacemaker and emits electrical signals that alter brain circuits, said Dr. Donald Whiting, a neurosurgeon who implanted the device in a 57-year-old woman from Mt. Lebanon. The woman, who declined to be identified, is showing gradual signs of improvement after the May surgery, Whiting said.
""""""""This gives us another option that can help patients get better and cut the medications they take,"""""""" said Whiting, vice chairman of neurosurgery at the North Side hospital. """"""""It's really a treatment that is in its infancy but has the potential to be very successful.""""""""
The Food and Drug Administration approved the device last year after a study of 26 patients showed a 40 percent reduction of symptoms in patients with severe obsessive compulsive disorder.
According to the National Institute of Mental Health, about 2.2 million Americans suffer from OCD, which causes unwanted, repetitive behaviors and thoughts. People with the disorder often engage in rituals such as continuous handwashing or checking things repeatedly.
Dr. Alicia Kaplan, an Allegheny General psychiatrist who works with OCD patients, cautioned that the deep-brain stimulation is not for all patients. It specifically is designed for people who have exhausted standard drug treatments and in some cases have taken high doses of antidepressants.
""""""""It's really reserved for those patients where OCD is so severe that they have no quality of life,"""""""" Kaplan said. Those patients are so obsessed with thoughts and rituals that they cannot hold jobs or interact with people, she said.
The device consists of a thin wire, an extension and a neurostimulator that are implanted near the collarbone. Electrical impulses from the neurostimulator follow the extension into the brain. The same technique has been used for more than a decade to treat patients with Parkinson's disease, tremors and dystonia, a movement disorder that causes involuntary contractions of the muscles.
The electrical signals are continuously adjusted as symptoms gradually decrease. This process can take months and is not always effective, Whiting said.
Doctors are adjusting settings in the device implanted in the Mt. Lebanon woman.
""""""""We've had ups and downs, but we are seeing some benefits,"""""""" he said.
If the device proves successful, patients could decrease the amount of medications they take. That could be helpful, Kaplan said, because most drugs used to treat obsessive compulsive disorder produce side effects.","['flatulence', 'Food', 'repetitive behavior', 'checking', 'quality', 'disease', 'tremor', 'process', 'Medication', 'Treatment', 'Thought', 'Rituals', 'urge', 'behavior', 'symptom', 'OCD']",['obsessive'],"['urge', 'disease', 'repetitive behavior', 'flatulence', 'quality', 'process', 'obsessive', 'Treatment', 'tremor', 'checking', 'Thought', 'Rituals', 'symptom', 'Medication', 'behavior', 'Food', 'OCD']",,1.0,,,
"Hi all , I'd like some advice on a checking theme I'm having in order to understand. Basically I'm struggling with a question popped in my head at a time when I was struggling with an intrusive topic in which was if I was attracted to morally young girls, now for years iv struggled with this type of ocd . It started when my girlfriend went to work and her younger sister stayed who would of been mid teens , I had an intrusive thought about her then managed to shake it off. Fast forward 5 years later I'm struggling with a similar theme and just when I'm getting the upper hand on this I get the thought """""""" what if I masterbated to her sister that morning"""""""" . My question to you is why the hell did that come in my head, I know after so many years of ocd I would never do this as I'm so against this type of stuff I have my own children I'm a decent human being with very good values but ocd has crippled me once again. I suppose what I'm saying is did I do it for it to enter my head and make me feel terrible guilty and disgusting. Ocd is saying I might of done it not realising it was a bad thing at the time even though I know it would of been . Then I'm thinking if I did do it then bad things are gonna happen to me and I don't deserve to be happy . Please can somebody help explain why I'd think that . I have no memory of doing this just the question of whether I did. It's making life a real misery.

"Recently, my day to day life has taken a bit of a stand against OCD. It's not terrifying me in quite the same way on the tube and in trigger situ's. Sometimes I even lapse into a trail of thought like I used to before it got worse.
However, I've over compensated a little. I've finally agreed to go to Australia (January), with some aunties and uncles, to see my father. I need to do this, but OCD (and nothing else) has stopped me. Yet I've gone for it and booked the flight. This scares me terribly... the ruminations have already started. I know that even now, a bout of agrophobia can trigger an OCD attack, despite my increased daily control of it. Waiting increases these panics, I have to keep moving... so what the hell am I going to do in a big open airport?! And the departure lounge?! And then, a plane (no escape at all!!! The worst thing is, I was a regular flier and getting on a plane used to be more common than a bus ride!!!!) journey that lasts 17 hours. I pine for arrival and the wonderful culture shock suspending my OCD... plus being around Dad helps... but how can I possibly face this experience?!?!?

"Hello everyone,
I don't know if anyone else has this problem but I find that if I feel I need to become a 'new person', (where I act perfectly and complete activities perfectly), because I've done something wrong, in order to ensure I have to complete the OCD rituals next day, I force myself to be hyper or be mean so that the next day I have a reason to become a 'new person'.
Does that make any sense?
The problem is the next day after a good night sleeping, I don't want to be a new person because I am thinking straight but because I was mean I am forced to do my OCD rituals.
How do I stop doing impulsive urges to be mean or stop being hyper and how do I deal with the thoughts of becoming a new person without going to sleep at 8pm?

"I am constantly tortured by stuff I did from the past from when I was a kid and a teenager into my late fifteens. The thoughts never leave me. They just get worse. My mind see's things from all the worst angles possible and digs me into a constant deeper hole. The thoughts are making me suicidal. I'm full of guilt, remorse and I worry myself into full blown panic attacks in case I have affected a person. Every waking moment these thoughts never leave me. I even dream about them sometimes. As soon as I open my eyes in the morning they hit me.
Within the last year I've been getting peado thoughts. These thoughts are seriously disturbing and are adding to my thoughts of suicide.
I used to stand for hours swallowing my saliva so many hundreds of times to a certain number to stop something happening that I didn't want to happen. Or I would have to step in and out of a doorway so many times or I would have to touch something.
I got a tattoo and a bad feeling came over me and I was convinced that it was HIV entering my blood stream.
It's the thoughts more than the rituals that are the real problem. They rituals have died down and the thoughts have taken over big time.
I'm always asking for reassuarance. I can't see that I have OCD. I think it's all coming from me and that I'm a bad person no matter how many times I get reassured. The reassurance wears off pretty quickly.
I'm hurting physically because of this mental torture.
Can anybody relate?

"Morning all.
Not feeling too great this morning and haven't done for the past few days. My thoughts of being a paedophile have returned in full swing and they're scaring the life out of me. I just can’t sleep properly and all I can think about are these truly horrible thoughts.
I know I’m incredibly guilty of avoidance. When these thoughts hit I try and avoid anything related to them – I won’t look at children, I avoid going out of the house in case I bump into a child yet it doesn’t help the thoughts go away.
One of the rituals I seem to have put in place is to look at women as an alternative. I’ve always been attracted to women and all my relationships have been with women. Only of course my mind attacks that and as a result it makes me think worse things. Do I wish that this woman was a child, etc. (Which then of course sets me on the course of avoiding women!)
I know that I’m not attracted to children and the mere thought of ever acting out one of these thoughts goes against every fibre of my being. I’m just finding it so incredibly hard especially as I had a couple of good days earlier on this week. I seem to look at everything in such a negative light when in theory I should be looking at them in a good way. My anxiety has receded which I should look at as my getting better when in fact I look at it as proof that I’m more likely to act on one of my thoughts.
I also question whether to type on this forum as I ask whether it’s just me looking for reassurance that I won’t do anything.
I’m on medication and expecting an appointment for a CBT assessment any day now which I’ll be honest with you I cannot wait to have as I want so much to learn some techniques to help me get back on track. (I do a lot of reading on the subject of OCD, but it’s one thing reading and trying to find self belief and another hearing it from a professional).
Don’t expect or hope for any replies to this post, but just wanted to explain what was going on in my head today.
Hope everyone’s doing well and all the very best…

"guys, i suffer from violent thoughts (pure-o). most of the time they are about people i love or know. i am seeing a psychologist at the moment and it has helped calm my anxiety.
i am at such a roller coaster right now. at some points during the day i tell myself that things are looking up and you are getting better. and i actually do feel better. but then when i get home hell breaks loose inside my head and i spike and spike. it is like ocd has a """"""""come back"""""""" for every positive thought or """"""""distraction state"""""""" that I come up with. for example: now that my sickening anxiety is gone, i think to myself that since I am thinking these thoughts without being sick i must be REALLY thinking them, not ocd. i know this isn't the case but alas, like 90% of us on here, i can't seem to control that kind of thought. sometimes i feel like crying (and do)and i feel so guilty about what i think in my head.
also, i have extreme mental chatter that basically puts me into a trance and i feel very disconnected from the world, especially when people try to talk to me, or i have conversations with others. my eyes tend to stare and not focus and my mind is completely enveloped with mental chatter.
i don't know what to do . i tried reading the four steps but i can't seem to interprut what they are saying into physical/mental actions. anyways, i just feel very low right now and having a hard time coping. anyone on here with pure-o at them moment with encouraging words? pls i am in a very strong ocd state right now and extremely anxious.

Basically I suffer with suicide OCD and have done for a number of years. Each time I relapse it feels just as terrifying as the first time.

i am pregnant at the moment and have been suffering with what I think is mild prenatal depression and this has massively triggered my theme. 
I am so scared that feeling depressed is making me feel actually suicidal and I am terrified. And that having suicidal ocd makes being depressed more dangerous?

"Good morning to you all,
I thought I was not doing too badly yesterday, tried to let the thoughts/mental ruminations pass by and was not doing too badly.
Came home and had an hour therapy session 4 till 5pm, a quick lay down then went to the ocd group but had to leave early cos I wanted to go to martial arts.
Got there, did class, felt ok but tired by the end, then whilst giving a mate a lift home and going home myself, BANG here we go again!
Thoughts started popping in, i could'nt think properly, was tryin to make them stop and off, trying to calm down, when I got home I tried my hardest to let them drift on by but went to bed kind of 'on edge'.
Woke up this morning and just want I didn't want to remember came straight in, I tried not to give it time but kept feeling I had to go over it all in my head and figure out what the triggers where etc.
Got the what if it was not the ocd this time, panic cos I might not have paniced! trying so hard to think what was what and have ended up in one big panic. Have been trying to say """"""""look its the ocd"""""""" but its not sinking in very well!
I have been shaking, crying panicing etc etc, part of me wants to and knows I must not react to things but then this other part is screaming """"""""I must check through, sort it out so I know what happened""""""""!
Am tired now as well, dont think it was the best nights sleep I have ever had.
This may sound stupid sometimes when I dont feel so anxious I think """"""""should'nt I be panicing or anxious about this?"""""""" Why am I not panicing? are the ocd thoughts not meant to disturb me? etc etc
As in previous threads I have mentioned about being told I am greiving for my mum who had to go into a nursing home (she has MS) I cared for her for 14 yrs and they dont think I am ready for 'full on' cbt yet. Also told depression and anxiety are playing me up again!
I am sorry to make this so long but am so sick of things,
Its like my part of my mind is 'against' me! I am sure if I had a white cat it would try and tell me it was black!
I feel so pathetic, stupid and doubting myself its unbelieveable!

"I am in a bit of a bind with my OCD at this point because the reality based fears I have is true, yet I don't know what to do; my coworkers are hiding behind my back and hanging out, which makes me spike.

My anxiety has probably put me in this situation to the point of them can't trusting me. I spiked and said """"""""I didn't tell beforehand about someone being let go."""""""" I don't think they trust me more because of how I reacted even though I didn't tell.
I am trying to practice CBT, but how would I go about it as the fears are true? I want to tell them that I know them hanging behind my back, but I am okay with it.

"Hi
I've wrote on here a few times in the past, suffer from checking OCD and contamination OCD. Managing to cope without meds... Had cbt last year which helped alot but seems to be creeping back a bit. Think the main reason being that when I wes seeing the counsellor I was working hard at the exposure tasks and stopping the rituals.... I think seeing her each week pushed me so that I would keep trying so that I didn't let her down... And so I suppose I stopped working as hard when I started seeing her and now
I can feel it getting worse again.
My question is... When doing exposure response prevention... Do you feel it better to just expose yourself to the thing that scares you the most?? ( eg for me for example touching a toilet seat and not washing my hands) or would you start at baby steps and work your way up to the scarier things?

"Hi there! I am in dire need for support after my OCD has spiked to an all time new high. So much so I have put myself into respite care for a few days as I am so terrified by my thoughts and my inability to manage them. I m terrifed I am going to snap, so to speak, and follow through on them.
I just had a really big month with work as well as having two friends here visiting me from t he UK. So when I wasn't traveling around the country working I was traveling around the country and showing them NZ. It involved a lot of travel, late nights and a little bit of alcohol. For the last two weeks now I have been feeling terrible. The worst I have in many years. Probably 15 to 20 years. I feel like I don't have control over my thoughts any more and they have control over me. I try and fight them all the time, knowing that it's not the right thing to do but I feel I have to or else I will do them.
I play out scenarios in my head like people being told that I have committed suicide and what their reactions will be to it. I am continually going into my future and playing out these scenarios. It terrifies me. I also get questions that pop into my head and I feel the need to answer them. My OCD is mainly religious based so it is that the devil is going to take me over and make me carry these thoughts out. I keep thinking that I am breathing the devil in and so I have to ritualize to get rid of it. The things is I no longer feel like ritualizing, which must mean that I want the devil.
I am sorry if this all sounds so complicated and crazy. I have never been so tired and confused and scared as I am now. If you have any advice or words of encouragement it would be hugely appreciated.

Right now the theme that is really affecting me in relationship OCD. I am extremely anxious and I do not know what to do! Joining this forum has calmed my anxiety a bit and I hope someone has gone through what I am going through. Well, I have been dating my boyfriend for 6 years now, and I know it is a long time for two really young people. However, we love each other and we are growing together and get along great. However, at this moment I really feel like I have to break up with him but I really do not want to. I am so scared that I ant to and I am strongly rejecting this feeling. I do not know if it is OCD or if it is reality but it feels extremely terrible. I think about this all of the time and I feel like such a monster for even thinking it! I need reassurance or feedback before making a decision because I do not know what to do and my anxiety is over the roof. This was triggered a couple of months ago when I found that I had a crush on a guy at my job. I questioned my love for my boyfriend and rejected this crush.. I hate it but my anxiety wasn't as bad. Then, for some reason two weeks ago i as extremely anxious because my boyfriend did not admit to us """"""""lasting forever,"""""""" he is a very realistic person and just told me that time would tell. I did not sleep well that night and I kept asking my boyfriend if he was going to break up with me (we had recently gone through a breakup this April). A few days later, I thought about having the crush on the guy and then shrugged the thought off. However, I felt the need to rethink the situation and question my love for my boyfriend. Now, I as the one afraid to break up with my boyfriend and afraid that I may not love him because of my thoughts. My best friend keeps telling me that crushes are normal because we are sexual beings. However, that does not seem to end. One day I am scared of my boyfriend leaving me, and now I am afraid I am going to break up with him to not waste his time because I do not know how I feel right now. I want distance between me and him but when we are together I feel so calm and loved. When I am with him my anxiety usually goes away and I love and protect him the same way he loves and protects me when we are together. I just do not understand what I am feeling. I am so afraid to stop loving him and to leave him. The thought of not loving me is crushing me so much!  I am starting to believe it is because of all the stress I am under right now because of college. Someone help me, I want to make the correct choice. What if it is not OCD? Why do i think about it so much? I have to avoid watching shows portraying cheating and romance because they make me sick. I am so overwhelmed.

"So lately my OCD has gotten worse. Possibly because I stopped taking medication (I'm going to get back on it) but possibly because...sometimes it just gets worse.
Yesterday, I'm sitting at my computer showing my mom something. For whatever reason, she's adjusting her belt. It was actually undone. Naturally, since one of the biggest themes of OCD is worrying about incest, this freaked me out. Of course she was just doing it for whatever reason. So, OCD tells me that if I don't say something, that means I'm """"""""okay"""""""" with it and """"""""okay"""""""" with incest.
So I just say something like """"""""What the heck are you doing?"""""""" and she just explains it (I forget what she said). But then my OCD made me feel compelled to explain the whole thing to her. Sometimes, with OCD, I have to explain things to people or """"""""resolve"""""""" things so that I don't feel anxious. Otherwise I just can't concentrate.
So I explain it to her (she understands OCD at least a little bit) and make sure she knows I'm not sexually attracted to family members and all that ****. Later, I read her this whole thing:
You were adjusting your belt – it was just something for my OCD to
pick up on. When it comes to OCD, one of the most common symptoms is
worrying about things like incest, pedophilia, homosexuality,
bestiality, etc. So you were doing the belt thing and it freaked my
OCD out because it could be construed as “weird.” OCD then told me if
I didn’t say something about it meant I was okay with incest or turned
on by it or something. I was worried if I didn’t say anything I would
obsess about that for days so I just said something. Maybe I shouldn’t
have said anything. But yeah, it’s just something OCD picked up on
because OCD picks up on the worst possible things. This is all OCD.
And now my brain worries that things will be “contaminated” by that
thought.

I don't know. What if she now thinks I'm incestuous? This is bothering me to the extreme and I feel the need to talk to her about it more, to explain it all until I feel okay about it. Maybe I should not have said anything when she was undoing her belt, but OCD said to me """"""""If you don't say anything that means you """"""""like it"""""""" or are okay with it.""""""""

This one word - indifference - sums both these desires up. It also gives us the chance to say to oursleves - """"""""its not that I don't care, I just need to not obsess or compulse and break free""""""""

"As of late I have been having a lot of trouble sleeping. My psychiatrist says it is a combination of some new stresses in my life and a side effect of my medication. It is getting to be a real drag. I do everything possible so I am sleepy at night but I just can not seem to """"""""let myself"""""""" sleep.
Long story short, for years I was on a very low dose of Xanax. (.25mg/a day) when my OCD spiked in November it got increased to 1.25-1.5 per day. My psychiatrist finally put me on 2mg of the extended relief tablet. So I only have to take it once a day, but due to the insomnia I was having when I started Lexapro she added an additional .25mg at night. Over the last couple of weeks she has suggested increasing it to .5mg at night and that was working great except I was still v. sleepy all day long. So I cut it back again to .25mg. Now I am sleepless again. I can nap during the day but can not sleep at night. I have for the last two days not napped at all and still am barely sleeping before dawn.
My biggest concern is that I know my body is relying on the xanax during the day but I do not want to have to rely on it to sleep. I am terrified of becoming truly addicted. I had a small drug problem about 15 years ago and since then have always been very careful.
Is it just a matter of time before my sleep rhythms come back?? or am I stuck without sleep forever???
I think one of the other issues is that another side effect of the medication is very vivid and lots of dreams. I mean more than ever in my life, so that I feel like I am not really sleeping even when I am.
I do not want to change medications because the OCD is a million times better.
Any advice at all??
Sorry to ramble I do that when I am tired... and it is almost half past four in the morning here......

"Hi all,
As you can tell from the time of this post i am really struggling at the moment with insomnia. I was wondering what other people had found to be of some use?
I have to be the last person to go to sleep anyway, part of the ocd, and i have loads of nighttime rituals which are time consuming but my main problem is the fear of being in bed. I know that when i go to sleep i will have nightmares and, what i call, ocd taunting dreams. For example, i dream that i am doing things that i would not do when i am awake becuase of the ocd and in my dream it has no effect on me but when i wake up i can't remember if i dreamt it, like touching the floor, or if i did it, so i have to do loads of rituals all over again. Plus i have major problems with magical thinking and i fear that if i dream something it may happen even though logically i know it can't, and when i am awake i can do simple rituals to counter the Pure O thoughts but i can't do them when i am asleep.
I have tried sleeping tablets and herbal remedies and they do help me get off to sleep but then i have loads more dreams and so wake up constantly becuase of them.
Does anyone else struggle with this? I have seen this developing over the last few months but i have been unable to stop it and now i am in a bit of a muddle becuase i don't get to go to sleep until 5am at the earliest and i know that tiredness makes the ocd worse.
Just wondering if anyone else has had any success with dreams and nightmare problems like these, i am going to ask my GP for sleeping tablets again to try and get me back into a normal pattern but i am keen to find an answer to the dreams?","['insomnia', 'Thought', 'tiredness', 'fear', 'Rituals', 'OCD']",[],"['fear', 'Thought', 'Rituals', 'insomnia', 'tiredness', 'OCD']",,1.0,,,
"Hi
Recently I feel my OCD (Pure-O mainly) has been getting worse as basically I can't go a day without it picking out stuff to obsess and worry over. The thing is, it usually goes from day to day and from worry to worry and they come and go, but not last Wednesday but the Wednesday before, I got a worry that really kinda sunk in, and still today it's bothering me, usually they only last a few days, a week at the most, but it's still going strong which for me means that it's never going to go away now or let up.
But the problem is, last night I had another of these worries that sunk in, it wasn't really about anything 'significant', essentially it just involved me using the computer and I started worrying about just being on the computer, for no particular reason or theme, just being 'on it' as it's where I spend most of my time, so it feels like its trying to take away my main 'interest' and attatch a sense of worry and anxiety around it. But then today, I play a game on the computer, and I got this worry/fear about the game aswell, just generally about playing the game, and so this feels infectious now like it's going to spread to anything I enjoy doing and any of my interests. I just feel quite 'detatched' now, as when I'm using the computer and playing the game I just feel anxious and that I'm thinking it over constantly, I'm ruminating again but I can't really stop it.
I really don't know what to do right now, I feel like I'm at a kind of loss as this worry is taking over all of my interests and feeding them with a feeling of anxiety and worry and I feel like these will never go away like the thought I had the other week that is stil bothering me.
Basically, I used to find that I would get intense worry over something for a day or two and it would gradually die down and I would just end up forgetting about it, but these things still get logged in my long term memory so 1, 2, 3 or six months down the line I could remember it but it won't really bother me. But I find that these worries are just constantly in my short term memory and I can't distract myself with anything as it's affecting everything I usually distract myself with. Catch-22. Just feel pretty horrible at the moment and I don't hold out any hope for feeling any better with all of my interests being taken from me by this OCD.
If people could just post their thoughts or any advice etc. its much appreciated.
Thank you.","['fear', 'joy', 'hope', 'OCD', 'anxiety', 'anxiety', 'Thought', 'interest']",['theme'],"['anxiety', 'OCD', 'interest', 'fear', 'Thought', 'joy', 'theme', 'hope']",1.0,,,,
"A doctor recommended this forum whilst I am unavailable to attend sessions with them…


Sorry but I am writing this message anonymously so my name is Red Flower. I hope you understand that being able to explain the problem means I have to talk about many things that I could never talk about normally. So I would prefer that the person writing this doesn't exist... For example I see it as completely inappropriate to talk openly about sexual topics to anyone outside of the obvious one person, and perhaps a doctor when very necessary (contrary to the shameless openness of a lot of people regarding this topic). I changed my writing style as well to hide it even further, so please don't assume I am a ***** because of my tone!





Hello


I would appreciate that you read the whole post as I feel this is different to the forms of OCD I have read on the internet, not sure if it is even OCD, maybe OCD mixed with something else.


I feel my OCD most loosely resembles the contamination class that people seem to mention here, however I do not have the hand washing issue. I simply avoid the “contamination” in the first place. I know washing my hands when I feel they are “dirty” will help in the short term, but I am refraining from this as it would be a temporary solution before I simply fall into the hand washing habit and have a different issue to deal with instead…





I believe there are two types of dirt, for everyone, not just OCD sufferers. The first type would be genuinely contaminated substances - medical needles, dead animals etc. The second type of dirt is biologically perfectly clean and safe, it won't spread any germs or diseases, it is just unpleasant and inconvenient.


For example:

a) biologically dirty - a pool of water with used medical needles dumped in it, justifiable to avoid it even without OCD

b) biologically clean - a pool of sterile mud which is completely safe, but even a non-OCD sufferer would still not want to put their hand into it


The artificial, OCD related “dirt” I worry about is in the b) category. I know it will not harm me, I do not worry that I will become unwell, diseased, etc. I just do not want it on me…





On to my personal issue…


This is very uncomfortable to explain so please understand this…


I often live with other people. No reason to go into detail, I will just go straight to the fact. They watch pornography and do other stuff in that field, no need to explain the rest, but they will have “stuff” on their hands when they are finished. I am scared that I touch the """"""""stuff"""""""". I am cautious about touching certain things, that I predict they have touched when they are finished, as they will have this “stuff” on their hands and it is now on the object. For example they probably wash their hands when they are finished, so I avoid touching the taps and soap. Items I avoid include the taps in the bathroom, the knob on the shower, towels, the laptops/technology used by these people, et cetera…


It is very important to note that I do not have this fear with public objects, such as traffic light switches or public doors, even items which are very likely to have the """"""""dirt"""""""" on them like school computers or even public toilets!...it only seems to be where I am living, involving the people I live with for some time.


The reason I went into so much detail about the two types of dirt above is because, I know that, even if I do have this “stuff” on my hands, it is not biologically harmful. It’s just that I don’t think anyone would WANT it to be on their hands, given the choice, much like the mud example I gave…


I think this is an exaggerated fear however I do often worry if my concerns are justified to some extent, given the fact that the “dirt” I am worrying about is real, and not some non-existent dirt that a lot of OCD sufferers believe exists. However, I notice that others do not have the same worries, leaving me wondering whether it is an issue with my mind, or, if it is a justified concern that others do not have, only because they do not think about it as I do, and do not realise it is there. Similar to how in the middle ages people didn’t worry about germs that they would now, but this was only because of ignorance…


The main reason I do not want this on me is because I want to be clean/innocent for…call them Red Leaf?… and having this “dirt” on me will make me not good for them…





The second part of my issue is, if I do feel I have “dirty” hands, I am hesitant to touch objects that I have spent a lot of money on, or that I know will be used for a long time and are not replaceable (for financial or sentimental reasons), for example: laptop keyboard, television buttons, iPad, pens, teddy bears, watch. This is because I do not want to make them “dirty”…Although, strangely, if my hands are “clean” I will be able to touch something I have previously touched with “dirty” hands and not feel “dirty” myself.





So I am wondering a few things


• is this OCD or just a slightly more intense worry about something that a lot of people worry about?

• if it is OCD do you know of any information source that is about an issue like mine?


and most importantly


• any words you can say to help me


also, I would appreciate any other comments, suggestions or experiences you may have…





Thank you very much

"I hope no one minds me jumping aboard and asking for some feedback. Ive not been on here for a long time, had made a lot of progress within my life and still sticking with it. However mentally I am struggling. Basically my head feels like a washing machine constantly. I have rarely spoken to anyone about this, because I feel I will be viewed as attention seeking.
Basically for years now, Im talking from about the age of 10 or so I would constantly have internal thoughts conversations. I know as I kid I would be thinking up all different situations. They tend to be bad situations eg someone dying or getting hurt or myself becoming ill. Just things like that, I know it tended to be worse at bedtime.
Move on years later and it is still there, but a whole lot worse. It is there all day. More recently I have been interacting with others more and trying to break out of my strict routines and rituals etc. If I have a conversation with someone, as soon as its over I will be thinking about it, going over everything I said, repeating it in my head. I literally don't get a break. Im having internal conversations with others, thinking of what I will say, then relaying how they will react etc.
Im not sure if this is related to my OCD, Ive never thought of it as and I literally hate myself, think Im a bad person and if I do have conversations with anyone I then punish myself, because I keep thinking I just want attention. I then punish myself by self-harming. I have very little self-worth and would find it hard discussing this all with someone, especially when I will probably get told this is normal. Because it doesnt feel normal.
I constantly need distractions, I cant deal with quiet and it can send me into a panic, constanly listening to music etc. Im so stressed with it all and embarrassed to admit what goes on in my head. I seriously dont want attention, yes sometimes I am really struggling and need support, but if I ask for support it is backing up my theory of wanting attention and going back to the conversations I have in my head.
I hope that makes sense, Im just not liking myself very much at all and will punish myself.","['talking', 'Rituals', 'OCD', 'hope', 'Thought']",[],"['talking', 'OCD', 'Thought', 'Rituals', 'hope']",,1.0,,,
"Do you get OCD spikes and anxiety attacks when you're around other people? Are you pretty good about letting people know you're having trouble at that moment, or do you have a habit of internalizing and trying to pretend nothing's wrong?
Whether it's anxiety related or not, I have a horrible habit of bottling everything up. I'm not alone that often, about 3 days a week I get out with people because I participate in a Bible education work going from door to door, so I'm often in a car with a few people. Just today I was having a HORRIBLE OCD spike/anxiety attack combo while I was out doing that and it was killing me! But I internalized it and tried not to make it obvious. Could this be bad for me, not letting my friends know that I'm having an attack and need to be left alone for a few minutes to clear my mind?
I just hate causing everyone to worry. I don't want all that attention, people overreact (unintentionally) and it makes me feel guilty for even bringing my problem up. I'm already anxious enough, I don't need them to be anxious for me!

"Hi everyone, I'm actually quite excited to be here which is a pretty major thing for me. I've suffered from contamination OCD for 20 years, but historically have been unable to talk to anyone about it. I've had some CBT, which had to end prematurely as I moved, so I didn't really get anywhere in terms of improving my condition, but it has meant that I'm more able to talk to people about it. Watched the program """"""""Extreme OCD Camp"""""""" last night, and realised that it's maybe time to chat to some other sufferers out there - I've only met one other person that suffers, and his OCD is the checking kind, would love to chat to others who suffer with similar problems to me.
I'm scared of toilets, bins, cleaning equipment, the floor (especially outside) and hate sitting on the floor, and my own individual quirk, I can't touch shoes without washing my hands (which is actually where my OCD started). I expend so much energy every day making sure that none of the above get cross-contaminated with other stuff - it's exhausting, and because I work with people all day long it's hard to avoid situations that make me panic.
Last Sunday however, I had a situation where I was triggered, and was unable to ritualise to resolve it because of where I was, so I just sat there for a good two hours before I was able to leave, just dealing with the panic. Felt so proud of myself, and know my CBT therapist would have been proud of me too! This has given me the strength to take steps to improve my condition again, so would really appreciate encouragement. I know I will need CBT again at some point, but I move again in a year, and don't want to start with another therapist just to move again. Hopefully this site can help to plug the gap!
Would really appreciate your encouragement, and especially to hear from other people whose OCD is similar to mine. Also looking forward to encouraging some of you too!

"Hi, I've been doing really well yesterday but tonight has been bad. My question might be asking for reassurance, but it's something I've been wondering about across changing themes of OCD, and perhaps someone has some insight into this: Is it possible to have intrusive feelings without any concrete thoughts? I guess I've seen people say that a feeling is always started by a thought or image. People so often say that they know deep down that the thoughts/feelings can't be true, but I just feel that they are true but I don't want them...
Anyway, I'd love to hear how people deal with this kind of thing!

"Imagine a fork in the path you are walking along.
If you go left down the negative path, you will find emotional storms, bad news, distress, tension, anxiety and, as a result of that, depression.
If you walk down the right, positive pathway, you will find happy people, joy, affiirming inspiring activities,a brain thinking hapiness and feeling happy and planning more joy and happiness.
So, however much you feel that OCD is pulling your strings, you can do something to manufacture your own happiness - you can exercise some degree of contro.
Think of how Amazon Kindle operates. Very simply, Amazon's computer servers track what you choose - so if you choose a book on lowering blood pressure, and another on seeking happiness, it offers you more books on a similar theme.
If you buy a humorous book, it selects and offers you more humour and happy thinking.
So in those dark times when we are distressed and unhappy, reframing our type of thinking, stopping ruminating and choosing more appropriate ways of thinking, and positive activities - even the type of people we are with - can ese us away from distress and de;pression and into a happier healthier frame of mind.
Incidentally I for one totally abhor the use of TV screens all over the place forcing into our faces the very latest distressiong news stories - I choose not to look at them, and to focus on something more beneficial.
It can be your choice where you can exercise discretion, choose the positive fork in the path.","['anxiety', 'anxiety', 'depression', 'OCD', 'joy', 'happiness']",['theme'],"['anxiety', 'theme', 'depression', 'joy', 'happiness', 'OCD']",1.0,,,,
"From as far back as I can remember, I have always had obsessive thoughts about all things sexual. I believe this stems from the abuse that I suffered from a very young age (8-10). The abuse made me obsessed with sex and I think triggered the obsessive thoughts. It wasn't until I was much older (16) that I realised I didn't want these thoughts in my head and that they were not healthy. Before realising this, I had just thought that what I was thinking was a part of growing up and everyone else my age thought the same way as me. When I hit 16 (and when I met my boyfriend), the rituals begun. I would spend a lot of my time trying to put my anxiety at rest and doing certain things which would counteract my unwanted thoughts. At this point, I was sure that I didn't want any of the things I thought about to become a reality and had sharp reactions when I felt like I was in a situation where something could happen.
But then things started getting worse and my mind started to tell me that I did want those things to happen and that I was a bad person. I felt like I had changed completely as a person, my personality was different and the way I saw things was different. For example, if I saw a person that my thoughts had been centred around, whereas before I would have been falling over myself to get away from them or knew that aslong as I performed my ritual it would be fine, now I believed I was a disgusting person who wanted my thoughts to become a reality and froze whenever they came near me. Performing rituals didn't really have much effect anymore, the thoughts had taken over.

"So I had a baby 4 weeks ago and since I've had intrusions... at the start it was about not bonding with her and now it's gone on to an article I read a few years a go about a man not believing his baby was his and I thought 'God he is crazy for thinking that'...and then I read another one about two babies who got swapped in russia So guess what I've been doing having stupid intrusions realted to that like...
'what if she's not yours, it would send you crazy'
'Maybe the midwifes swapped your baby'
'Maybe you had a still born and they gave you that baby to cover it up'
'what if mum and rob are lying to me about the baby being mine'
'maybe you passed out after delievering'
'maybe Rob had a baby with some one else and it's there baby'
I KNOW these are intrusions about what I read the spike of anxitey after them is hideous I feel like someone is bullying me constantly mentally tourtred would be a good word for it!!... I spoke to my Dr about it and she was like it's your OCD playing mind tricks and make sure you stop reading stupid stories because OCD is always going to love that ...I was worried about Post natal depression and she said it's defo not that it's my OCD spiking because of hormones etc...
After each thought I keep thinking 'OMG I AM CRAZY, I'm loosing it.... what is up with me?' ' I must be crazy to even think that' 'what If I start to believe them' and wishing for the thoughts to go away...so I can get on with things...I keep panicing im schizophernic as well.... or have some kind of serious mental illness.. I'm scared of telling people what they are because I feel like they will think I am crazy I was really embarrassed telling the DR before...I was walking round town thinking 'this is it i've lost it'
They get worse when Im near people when they say oh she looks like you my mind becomes flooded with them....and I think they know what I'm thinking in a way
I'm petrified I will start to believe them...or that I have this mental illness/ going crazy... The over night I sat up pulling my lashes out because I'm so scared of them.
I keep doing reassurance as well like checking pictures of her but then I get maybe they taken her out of the room etc or when was these taken?. Or asking rob about the birth but then I get another intrusion he is lying then I get back on to the panic of 'maybe I have parnoid schizophernia!' another thing is trying to prove the intrusions that they are wrong....
I am waiting for my paroxtine to start working but obviously my OCD is really bad at the moment.. I'm scared these thoughts will be here for ever and I will always have them about my daughter...
Do you think this sounds like my OCD or something more serious?

"Hello,
I am new to this place and am looking for some advice from those in a similar position to myself - though I realize we are all different.
For as long as I can remember I have suffered from - and I'm not exactly sure what to call them - intrusive/obsessive thoughts, constant rumination. They don't seem to fit in with any of the OCD patterns I have read about, ie they are not violent, I don't think that people are looking at me or that something awful is going to happen, etc. I """"""""just"""""""" obsess, ie cannot stop thinking, about various things, ie if I have a toothache, I just cannot stop thinking about it. I don't think that I am going to get mouth cancer, just about the ache. If I have a task to do, I cannot stop thinking about it until I have done it. I have suffered from anxiety all my life and worry about everything, but no one has yet come up with a definitive diagnosis other than Obsessive Compulsive Personality Disorder which may, or may not, be accurate. Nothing I have tried - medication, therapy, etc - has ever helped. I should add that I also suffer from severe depression, having lost my only son in December 2010 (though these symptoms have been with me since childhood).
Sorry to be so verbose, but any advice would be greatly appreciated.","['Thought', 'OCD', 'anxiety', 'anxiety', 'Medication', 'depression', 'symptom']","['rumination', 'obsessive']","['rumination', 'anxiety', 'obsessive', 'depression', 'Thought', 'symptom', 'Medication', 'OCD']",1.0,,,,
"Hi everyone, 
Hope you’re all ok.
My OCD is doing my head in yet again! 
I have quite a few themes, some have got better though. 
Does anyone else get visualisation’s (for want of a better word) as well as thoughts, so for instance, I can be driving and go over a bump, worry in case it’s a person, and end up checking loads? Also though, I sometimes can be driving along, not even go over a bump but suddenly visualise a person is walking out in the road (there isn’t one of course). I then end up checking in case there was a person, and if this happens, and also a slight bump, I can check for absolutely ages. It’s weird, but it happens most at zebra crossings and at junctions when I’m turning left or right and I’ve slowed down anyway.
I find this so very hard not to check though, even harder than just a bump, as my mind then says that person was real.
I’ve had similar with cleaning products, so for instance I may be cooking something, notice the cleaning spray then imagine I’ve put it in the cooking pot, so I’ll tip everything out and start again. 
Does or has anyone experienced this, and how can you stop your mind visualising? I feel like it’s the don’t think of a pink elephant scenario!!

"Hey to everyone. Having an eye-opening few days with regard to educating myself a little more on the mechanics of OCD. I am really giving my best to try to deal with having Ocd in my life. I'v put proper recovery on the long finger for so long because i couldn't grasp how one could recover from what i have, which is false memories and being petrified about the past and not being able to move on until i got the 'answer'. Having spent many incredibly painful years trying to remember memories from over 10 years ago, i ,without even knowing, found myself in a tangled mental maze from hell, and its one i can't undo. I'm not going to make a fool of anyone here and say i still don't try to remember after a spike or rush of anxiety, because i do. But fortunately i do now realize after many hellish years, that 'thoughts' of any kind, cannot be fought by us humans. We don't have that control unfortunately. Its like trying to punch the air. But what i am curious about is, are our minds capable of inventing/creating false flashbacks or memories while we try SO HARD to remember? When i find myself ruminating to remember 10 years ago, i get flashes of memories and i can't make out if they represent reality or not. If its a frightening flash or image i see, i dwell on it see if its real or not. It then becomes/feels as real as anything and i get incredibly anxious and confused and always end up on that road to nowhere. But it can be so real its like i can see it in front of me. Thats my main stumbling block. I cant get past that one. Its frustrating because i really want to help myself so i can get on with life and live for awhile. Anyone relate?

"OCD-UK are launching a photographic fair for people affected by Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder.
We want to get children and adults with OCD exploring life a little differently to help them see the beauty of life through the focus of a camera lens, and to challenge the feelings and thoughts of pain and despair that this insidious illness often makes us feel on a daily basis.
We want everyone with OCD to get involved, photographer or not, if you have access to a camera then get involved, you may surprise yourself! Do you love animals or architecture maybe, enjoy being outdoors and like taking photos? Well, now’s your chance to unleash your creativity, snap what you love and give us all the benefit of your talents. With varying themes each quarter in addition to the theme of our ever-changing seasons now that everything is bursting into life and colour, we are sure we will be seeing some wonderful photographs from you as you leave the focus of your OCD to one side for a few minutes as you focus on your creativity.
Hopefully it will also be an opportunity for you to participate in something that may help you refocus on the life around you rather than the daily struggle for life inside your head.
This is not a competition as such as our aim is for the OCD community to get involved for themselves, rather than to feel they must achieve specific standards of competition photography. Some of your photos will be displayed in our quarterly magazines and on our website for everyone to see and enjoy, but don't worry if you haven’t got the chance right now to participate, you will have ample opportunity throughout the year. We also hope to gallery showcase some, or all of the photos in the future.
We are not necessarily looking for fantastic photographic technical skills – all pictures will be welcome, we want people of all photography abilities to get snapping away, this project is all about being involved and taking part.
Good luck everyone,
The OCD-UK Team.","['Thought', 'despair', 'surprise', 'site', 'napping', 'joy', 'hope', 'OCD']","['theme', 'obsessive']","['surprise', 'napping', 'hope', 'OCD', 'site', 'obsessive', 'Thought', 'joy', 'theme', 'despair']",1.0,,,,

the reason i ask is i have read many many stories on here with people taking higher dosages than 100mg
i`m already having
excessive sweating
sometimes slightly jittery feeling
anxiety sometimes

will going higher dosage make the above worse?

"I am having a heated discussion with my social worker at the moment about whether I have obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD), generalised anxiety disorder (GAD), including social anxiety and depression or low mood.
My social worker wants to know why this is so important to me and says that being given these labels won't help. I was originally diagnosed privately in March 2005 with all of the above, but the NHS professionals don't seem to approve of this.
I don't want to know so that I can have a badge of honour or it printed on my forehead for the world to see. If I am asked about it I will talk about it, because it is important that people know about it and help raise awareness. I am not embarressed about having these things. I don't want people to feel sorry for me or make excuses for me when I find something hard.
What I would like is to know for sure that my strange behaviours and rituals fit in somewhere. That I belong to this group and that I can get support from OCD forums or support groups. That when I talk to another person about these things, be it someone with or without OCD, I am not telling lies and I am not a fraud.
This not knowing has really affected me lately - loss of appetite, sitting in the dark thinking for hours, bad moods, low moods, tiredness.

"I always feel like I have to be obsessing over something just cus I feel if I don't something is going to go horribly wrong. Please read my story:
This has been going on for years and I think I've just realized how it started - I felt like I was being too happy and carefree and that something had to be wrong. I've battled through quite a lot of themes but they've mainly revolved around existential stuff and religious stuff, even though I'm an atheist. I think these themes were triggered because I don't normally worry about 'normal' stuff, such as work, friends, and these problems always seem to sort themselves out, so I had to find something to worry about that I might not even know about.
For example, I went through a solipsism phase once - I had to obsess over solipsism just IN CASE it was true, otherwise I felt like I'd be punished or something.
And now it's like I feel I have to search for any little thing that may be preventing me from getting fooled in life or something. I normally feel like I'm being fooled in the face of a higher being, though, and I have to believe in that higher being IN CASE it's true.

Something twice rather than 5 times and end up in tears) point being its still there, and
I will probably revert to becoming worse at some point.
At the moment I've worked on 'response' prevention, however havnt really done any deliberate exposure..and I'm struggling with how to. To be it feels totally morally wrong to say touch a toilet seat and then go a touch someone without their consent...?

I am new to this site so please be gentle 
I have for many years (more than 10) spent what I deem to be excessive amounts of time picking, plucking and generally mauling my own face. I spend up to an hour with a high magnification mirror and desk lamp examining every quarter of my face every night to look for rogue hairs or signs of a spot or flake of skin that could be ripped off.
What I am unsure of, and I hope this is where you can help, is whether this is CSP or learned behaviour as both my Mum and older sister do the same thing.
I suspect CSP as we all have OCD tendencies relating to order and perfection and I am also emetophobic which I think may be related to fear of contamination.
It is affecting my life as I can't go to bed until I have done it, even if it is 3am and I have to be up for 7.
What do you think? Any input is appreciated
55464[/snapback]
i think and people tell me if im wrong, but the minute that this picking has an effect on your life eg takes up an abnormal amount of time, affects social life (through marks) or has any impact on yourlife, its CSP.
It may be that its learnt, but in the last month i have learnt my sis and dad have OCD too, and we do the same things! but those things are in our heads! so perhaps you inherited it too! ?
whatever, at least you can taljk to your sis and mum about it?
if it has an impact on your lives you can work together and have people who understand what it means! you can distract each other and keep other from picking.
if they dont feel it is an issue, but you obviously do to be on here ammuse yourself. There are laods of tips, but as yet im finding it hard to find the right one.Im sure you'll be fine, and you can always see your doctor, but i know that is hard to do.

and another obessive though is about stealing. i know i wouldnt do it but somehow i fear i might to, and the biggest fear is that i would be considered as a stealer. other people can find me weird or awkward. how can i control it and that guiltness get away? do u think its mild ocd? i have ocd in two relatives, myy aunt has fear from bacterias and grandmother has rituals before leaving house. i dont have anything like that. just a fear somebody can read my minds and that it will be akward.","['bathroom', 'joy', 'guilt', 'severe ocd', 'Rituals', 'OCD', 'Thought', 'fear']",['obsessive'],"['obsessive', 'fear', 'severe ocd', 'joy', 'Rituals', 'Thought', 'bathroom', 'OCD', 'guilt']",,1.0,,,

"Hi everybody.
I'm completely new to this forum!
Basically a question about my condition...
Throughout my childhood I've had a big problem with food. It started aged 12, worrying about death and meat-cross contamination (after eating duck & nearly vomiting in a restaurant) Thoughts spiralled as I got older. I became vegan (disgust / fear of eating animal products?). Wouldn't eat in restaurants or around others. I had my own plate & cutlery. I stopped eating with my hands. I stopped eating outside.
I'm 19 now - the thoughts about food & drink are so intrusive and started affecting me badly over this past year (to the the extent I left uni and moved back home)
After visiting my GP earlier this year, I was referred to an eating clinic. I explained my situation and agreed this wasn't anorexia. I then took myself to a Psychologist who diagnosed me with moderate OCD, specifically food.
Trigger warning*
My main thoughts revolve around death, dead bodies, corpses and cremation and water and around the fact that water molecules have been part of a corpse / dead person and I'm now eating them. They're now part of me, I cannot escape, I over think and just want to 'run away'.
Anyway, I'm just wondering if these thoughts are typical of OCD? I have another appointment with my GP next week and am going to chat about the condition and also CBT. My problem is rumination and over thinking these things. I understand everyone is different but any help / advice would be much appreciated.

":dry: Hello, Im looking for some comfort and advice really and not too sure if Im in the right place. The past few years have been a nightmare if im honest and ive battled with every emotion going. My problems range from abuse, witnessing suicide and bullying. When dealing with problems, I usually avoid them in the hope they go away, even though I know this isn't the way to do it. I always act tougher than I am, I guess after the abuse it was my coping mechanism - if I act tough people will think they cant hurt me. Ive never had great confidence - its all just an act. I blame myself for a lot of things - the abuse - the suicide - the bullying. I think it was caused because im not a good person or I hate myself because I feel I should have done more. For the past 12 months ive wanted to change and I think this is where my recent problem has started. I often feel fenced in by people who are really only wanting to support and help me but ive never been one for letting people close to me.
My recent problem is that I have started boxing and weight training excessively and I cant seem to stop. The thought of someone being """"""""stronger"""""""" than me (like in the abuse) scares me to death and I have a feeling this is behind why im constantly pushing myself to be stronger physically. Ive tried stopping but I can't and people have started to notice that im doing it daily and always exhausted because of it. Just before I do the training (boxing/weights) its like their is a voice inside me telling me I should be ashamed that I let these events happen, its like if I push myself and push myself, it will make the situation better. Its really hard to explain and I really feel like im going mad. Please can someone help me.

"Hi, I'm new to this forum.
When I was about eleven years old (I'm 26 now) and I first started secondary school, the stress of starting High School made me become obsessive about washing my hands. I kept washing them because I thought that everything I touched was going to poisen me, so therefore I would have to wash my hands to wash away the germs. When I did touch something that I thought would poisen me I'd panic and wouldn't be able to relax until I'd washed my hands. It drove my family mad and made it so I couldn't relax when I went out anywhere and I was also affraid of doing experiments in Science at school because of handling chemicals that were potentially poisenous. Despite being affraid of germs I was also affraid of touching cleaning chemicals and using them as I also thought they would poisen me.
I also used to play with my hair and pull it out leaving me with bald patches, I do still play with my hair all the time now but I no longer pull it out and don't have any bald patches anymore. I used to be affraid of being alone or going anywhere alone in case anything happened to me and I died too. Now a days I can be alone and go somewhere alone without panicking as long as I know the place and I don't have to travel really far to get there.
I have calmed down on washing my hands as I've got older but still have odd moments when I feel I have to wash them after touching certain things. I don't worry about dying and being poisened as much as I used to. But I do now tend to keep checking things like that I've locked doors, turned the power off on sockets, turned lights off. I obsess about thoughts and people (celebrities and people I know), as I find that I can't stop thinking about them sometimes even though I do want to because it drive me mad. I also obsess about certain songs and play them over and over again driving my husband mad. Saying all this, I do seem to cope with it better these days and can still enjoy life now compared to how I was when I was younger.
The thing I really want to know is: I've never been to the doctor with this problem so have never had it diagnosed but I am certain that it is OCD and my family and friends have all said that they can tell I have OCD. I recently had a conversation with my mom about my OCD and I asked her: """"""""because I 've never been diagnosed is it ok for me to say I have OCD?"""""""" and my mom replied """"""""well with you, yes because it's obvious you have it"""""""". So that's what I wanted to ask you:
Is it ok to label myself as an OCD sufferer even though I've never been diagnosed with it?
I do know I have OCD despite it and as I've said my family and the people who know me well can tell I've got it.","['checking', 'joy', 'Thought', 'OCD', 'washing hands']",['obsessive'],"['obsessive', 'washing hands', 'checking', 'joy', 'Thought', 'OCD']",,1.0,,,

Only one thing can't pass away. That's my biggest problem. I need to stick my fingers into light sockets repeatedly. I always do it with my fingers and because every man's fingers are too thick to happen something- nothing happens. But one time i put a slim thing into the light socк.

So i put my fingers very often into light sockets but only when i am alone and nobody can see me because i am ashamed of this behaviour.
English is not my mother language so I am sorry if i wrote something incorrect.

"Hello, I'm new here, just joined and just want to explain my situation and make sure it is OCD...My doctor says it is, but my situation is never mentioned much(ever) on any of the websites about OCD.
Ok, I don't know where to start...I have just recently been diagnosed with having OCD. I have had social phobia for 7 years, so anxiety of some form has always been in my life...My doctor thinks I may have had OCD to some degree before getting the social phobia (as apparently that is common, rather than the social phobia causing the OCD) but it was never obvious to me because it never took over my life like it is now.
My OCD is mainly centred around my childrens bath time routine! I shamefully start there bed time routine at 3pm, (this is actually making me feel quite upset writing this, as I know my children are suffering because of my mad thoughts!) I have to be home every day at 230pm, so I can sit down with my little boy who is one and watch Thomas the tank engine, if for any reason they change the TV schedule I get really upset and think somthing awful will happen because my children haven't watched the right programmes befor bed. I close thier bedroom curtains in the middle of the day, or as soon as I get in, if I do have to be out past 1pm, once i have done that I have to set the bathroom ready for the childrens baths, neat piles of pjs, with a nappy on top, towel laid out perfectly on the floor...I then check this three or four times during the rest of the afternoon to make sure I have done it right! After Thomas has finished at 3pm I go upstairs with my little boys milk and run his bath, I have to put johnsons lavender bubble bath in it, then I come down stairs and close the curtains down staires! regardless of it been sunny outside...then I take my little boy for his bath, I have to wash his hair with the johnsons lavender shampoo then when it comes to dressing him for bed once he has his nappy on I have to put on his bottoms first and then his top, I don't even like the idea of putting the top on first, then he goes to bed...so he is in bed at 3.15pm! then with my little girl who is 2 she will watch peppa pig, then I will take her up stairs at 3.30pm! I don't like to wash her hair befor bed and really have to force myself to do it, so it only gets washed if it is absolutely needed, she also has to be in the bath with lavender bubbles...again when i dress her, the bottoms have to go on first then the top. She is usually in bed by 3.45pm!!! This is obviously very unfair on my children and I have tried putting the whole compulsive routine back, but it's a struggle for me as I feel they wont go to sleep or other terrible things will happen. I have to do everything in the correct way otherwise who knows what might happen.
Thats the main part the OCD affects, I also have to put my books in order of authers in alphabetical order, then each authors books has to go in chronological order! and if I find an author I like, I feel the need to buy ALL of there books untill I have them all and in the right order. Because if one is missing, it's just all wrong and not right!
As for cleanliness, it's not really an issue for me, the only time i am obsessive about dirt is while the children are eating or playing with glitter pens! I feel the need to get out the hoover straight away, even if they are still eating.
So if this is OCD which i'm told it is, it is causing huge family problems as obviously my partner is concerned about it, and he suffers too because of my """"""""rituals"""""""". My doctor has told me a clinical psychologist will see me, but the waiting list is 12-18 months!!! If i had the money I would see a private psychologist but it is not an option for me sadly. I have been taking citalopram but I am been weaned off them and I am due to start fluoxetine (prozac) on the 30th of this month. Is there anyone else taking prozac and does it help at all?
Thanks for any replies in advance.

"Hi all
My ocd is very harsh on me these days because I am fighting back and trying hard to convince myself that I cannot cause terrible things to happen to my children or loose them just by thinking it of it.
It is so awful to feel that I can decide with kind of life they could get in A life after this and being terrified that They will get a bad life where they are taken from me against our will, I have to give one of them up so I totally let the one kid down, or they will be abused or live in among bad people. I get all these stories or images in my mind all the time along with anxiety that kind of keeps the thought in my body. The thoughts are triggered by words, situations, old ocd thoughts, places and so on. It is awful to feel that I am loosing my kids or one of them or they could get A bad destiny if I dont do mental rituals along with movements in my arm, hand, eyes or elsewhere when I get A thought of this.
Every time I have such A thought - A short automatic one or one that unfold, I get the urged to save my children by a ritual or Else I feel that I will loose them or cause the scenario come true. The emotion from the scenario kind of stück to me and I am afraid that I have choosen such A destiny.
I am very afraid of thinking all kind of bad thoughts. I also have the thoughts associated with Movements or sensations (anxiety) so if I make A movement or have A sensation in my body while thinking something bad then The thought can come true or the thought can be choosen by my to happen. Then I have to reverse the movement while Thinking A Nice life for us. I also have the thoughts associated with thoughts of dead relatives. If I Think of A dead relative I immediatly need to Think of A good scenario of every one of us and it needs to be the same or Else the ocd says that in A supernatural Way the dead can read my mind and take the ocd thoughts As whishes and make them come true.
It is important for me to say that I am Into natural science and not very religiuos. So I am more and more convinced that we only live once, and death is like when you sleep and do t dream. And A dead soul cannot read your mind. And if they could my relatives would want Nice things for me.
And when the ocd is really bad. My ocd says I can transfer bad destiny to my children by touch or that I can transfer my children to people around my so when I am in A Room or at the Street I feel an sensation leaving me alone with a thought of my children and I need to take them back by reversing the sensation Into my body. But its quiet exhausting to go through A Day feeling I am walking on the Edge and having to save, save, save and Secure with thoughts of good lives.
My ocd tells me that if I dont Secure ones in A while then all the bad things can snick in and come true. But I want this life. I have the Best kids in the World and hope that they never be taken away and always will be mine. But all the securing keeps ocd going. So I have to stop this also. I have to stop all complusions. But it is very difficult when my ocd says:
- if you dont do rituals it can come true
- if you have A feeling of loosing your kid, giving them A bad destiny, feel you betray them, it will stay with you and you have choosen it to happen
- it is dangerous to have these emotions and thoughts and dont react to the or prevent them
- if you Think really intense and go through A scenario and dont do A ritual it can come true
- if you Think A thought A lot it can come true
- if the ocd makes you wish for it it gets A lot of power and can come true
- I am very lucky person who gets my whishes come true. I offen make the things I want happen. So the ocd can be percieved As whishes even though it is not at all - it is what I absolutly do not want.
Please tell my nothing will happen, no one have these powers. No matter how intense you Think A bad thought or have hard the ocd make you whish it, it cannot come true, right? It is an irrationel theme and just As impossible As aliens coming to Earth tomorrow or me suddenly becoming green all over the body. So I can leave the theme be and give it up. I cannot cause it to happen and my kids are safe.
I know its reassurance. And you will say so. I also know that my ocd tries to stay alive now I am fighting it and I know I feel better when I stop complusions. But I dont feel safe doing it all the time and doubt that it is safe to stop complusions when my childrens destiny are at stake.
The Strange thing is that I can have A daydream of kissing another man thats not my husband or thinking og taking A knife and killing some one and I dont Think it will come true and no it will never happen. But I see it just As Real As the other thoughts. So why should those horrible ones come true. It just because I react with anxiety they become ocd.

"Hi,
My doc used to be brilliant (think shes only recently qualified) she was the one who diagnosed me and she really made me feel at ease and comfortable and was so understanding, she had even been reading all about ocd just b4 the appointment (i had sent her a letter explaining all then went for appointment).
Then i went to her a couple of days ago and she said hows it all going referring to the OCD, so I proceeded to tell her, then she said """"""""oh the thing is, I think its a bit strange, all my ocd patients (bearing in mind she told me on my first appointment she didnt know alot about ocd, and i was her first ocd patient), will not touch anything in a doctors surgery, but you have your arm on my desk"""""""" to which I went bright red, felt like a right idiot and a liar, so i told her contamination wasnt my sole ocd issue and that i wouldnt touch anything in the surgery with my hands, she says well what is your main issue? so I just started rambling about how i went to go to the toilet b4 i went in but ended up washing my hands coz the toilet chain was unreachable with my foot, then how i dont open door handles with my hand, she says """"""""how do u do it then?"""""""" I showed her i do it with my top. But i was feeling like ive gotta pass some sort of test. So she made me feel like i was lying, then i start questioning myself am i lying? maybe its not ocd and im just a weirdo, thanks alot doc!

"Over the weekend I had a sudden unexplained spike in OCD problems-I had very bad feelings about the future and felt very bleak-hadnt felt this particular way in a while--I assumed it was related to the holidays.
Then yesterday i woke up and had much less OCD. But-when I went out in the afternoon my OCD just exploded in public and I had a terrible time. It crushed me.
After that I have been thinking about the types of treatment again-and after reading testimonials of others I have to ask--is OCD-or all forms of OCD-really treatable?
From some things I read they say the key is to expose one to the source of your fear to show the brain that it doesnt have anything to fear-to retrain the brain.
But I dont find that i can attack my OCD merely by building resistance as if I am constructing a brick wall around it piece by piece. It changes.
Each day is different--the way i think about things is different. Unless I have something else besides OCD-possible since my mother has schizophrenia and my father had some undiagnosed problem--
But what i wonder is--if OCD is treatable by CBT, what about ADD or Tourette's Syndrome? Some aspects of OCD seem to be related to those conditions. The persistent nagging feeling or voice, the spasmodic brain activity...
I guess I am skeptical that my OCD fits the type that supposedly can be dealt with simply by exposure therapy, and given what i have learned on this forum--and the media's ignorance of what OCD is, I wonder if the medical community is really just grasping at straws about how to treat it-or if they even understand it, or have all kinds of it classified.
I suppose I am feeling a bit angry and offended that it is described as treatable when I can clearly see evidence that suggests it isnt like putting a cap on a bottle and making sure its secure--and that somehow I am supposedly blessed with a condition which can be deconstructed and yet we wouldnt say the same about someone with Bi Polar or Tourette's. I think about that comment on the media page by someone from youtube who claimed OCD came from bad parenting as if it was spoiled behavior.I wonder if the CBT movement partly feeds this view of the illness by so much emphasis on it being treatable by exposure.
Is my skepticism really my OCD trying to stop me from getting treatment (I tried but I am in a medically primitive place) or is it that I realize OCD is more complicated (at least for some) than official medical channels claim?
At the moment I feel its the latter case.
Anyway i just had to vent about this.","['Activity', 'behavior', 'Treatment', 'fear', 'OCD']",['spike'],"['Treatment', 'fear', 'spike', 'behavior', 'Activity', 'OCD']",1.0,,,,

"Hi all,
I just wondered of anyone might have some thoughts/experiences they would be able to share on this subject?
From my own situation, I recently came off my medication in agreeance with my GP, as I was stable and doing well. I've previously had 2 (plus one 'booster') sessions of CBT over the past five years, and it was during the second course, which combined with the meds that I really made progress. The focus of my OCD has changed over the years, with the main difficulties initially around contamination and emetophobia, and then responsibility OCD and perfectionism associated with my job.
The first time I came off Sertraline (50mg), I was fairly well for a few months, but then following a stressful event, my symptoms spiked quite badly again, and I had my 'booster' cbt, and re-started the meds which given time worked well. That was about 14 months ago, and it was New Year that I stopped the meds again. This time around, I feel that my symptoms have come back almost instantly, and the focus isn't just on one particular area, but seems to be affecting quite a few areas of my life.
The purpose of me coming off the meds was to see how I'd cope without them as my husband and I are hoping to start a family. Given how I'm feeling now though, I just don't know how i'd cope off the meds long term. I'm trying to be strong and reflect back to the strategies i've been tought but with limited effect.
Is it to be expected that a life with OCD will always be this constant cycle?

"Hi people
Bit worried this may be a bit long but please stick with me. Its the first time that I've posted.
i'm a 29 year old girl and I am feeling pretty awful just now.
i look back on my life and can see that i was always a worrier and that I had OCD type features such as stroking my dog with my right hand only, tracing squares on the carpet with my feet etc.
I don't have any of these anymore or any 'classic' OCD type things like cleaning and washing and rituals. However, I get periods when I am so stressed and anxious that I can't eat or sleep and just feel like crying. I feel so despairing and desperate. I have worries which most of the time are happily closed away and apart from perhaps giving me a wee poke in the side from time to time don't generally trouble me. However, sometimes they flare up and really cause me problems. My specific worries revolve around my loved ones going to hell because they are not Christians/aren't good enough for God and also that i have caused them to be possessed by evil spirits because I 'wished' for this to happen. I did this in a way to 'challenge' myself i think to face up to my fears. This all started when I was around 12 or 13 i think. Since then these fears have never entirely gone away but I have lived with them and am generally on the whole happy. But at times like these they overwhelm me and I feel so awful. I also feel so alone as I don't think anyone has the same sort of fears.
I have been seeing a psychologist now for the last 6 years on and off and he's been very helpful. But I feel I could really do with the support of others who understand me. Does anyone else have worries like these and does anyone else experience patterns where these thoughts fade away but can come back? Is this a 'normal' story? I am just having such a difficult time just now and so worried about getting better.

"My themes of the last ~10 years have been in 2 related and seemingly rare categories, one of which I call """"""""hyper-compassion"""""""". This category means I feel compelled to find out how bad some kind of tragedy is or was for those involved. How badly they suffered. These are real events and the uncertainty is just about the finer details of how bad it was, which I try to find out by imagination, medical research, historical research and first person accounts. I must know because the thoughts about how bad it might have been, strike me with so much despair, it feels like I could never be happy knowing that it's true, so I have to know. Mostly I'm trying to convince myself that the details I wonder about are not true.
As these details are all very reasonable possibilities, what is irrational about this, is there anything? I struggle very much with deciding that I'm justified morally to fight it at all. The tragedies I obsess over are always things that not many people se em to know about (the second category of themes is all about whether people are indifferent to these same tragedies, which feeds and is fed by hyper-compassion ruminations) and the victims have been neglected, and I don't want to neglect them too. Is that OCD or just being compassionate and feeling guilt I should feel for trying to avoid the subject and so not being able to raise awareness etc?
If there isn't anything irrational about it, will the usual therapies for OCD still work? What cognitive distortions do I have, if any?

"Hello,
Today I went out into the country with my boyfriend to get some fresh air but had a really awful spike. My mind went off and one and tried to find some sort of evidence that i may of hurt or acted inappropriatly to children in the past. I absolutley love kids and would never hurt them but my OCD is trying to scrutinise all the times I looked after children in the past and to try and remember everything that I said and done. But the thing is, I can only ever remember being fun and loving with children. Is this normal for OCD? I adore kids so this sort of OCD hurts me so much:-(
Also, I've been looking back at things in the past and obsessing about them.Things that I wouldn't do now but that really aren't a big deal. I confessed to my boyf and a friend about one incident and they were just like 'it's nothing' and told me just to forget about it. I know i shouldn't have confessed but i felt like i just had to.
Really can't wait to get some CBT, i feel like my OCD is making me believe that i'm not the person i think i am. I'm looking back to silly little things/normal things in the past that I did (when I wasn't even an adult) and trying to find some sort of meaning out of them. For example, I remember slapping my sister on her back unprovoked and making her cry. Now my mind is saying 'your unpredicable and can't be trusted around people'!!!! I mean i must have been all of 9 years old?!?! WTF?? Obviously I wouldnt do that now as I know it's not a done thing.

"Hi everyone, I've only recently found this site and reading through some of the topics on here sound very familiar to what I have been experiencing for about 10 yrs now.
I have this repetitive fear that people think I'm gay, this in turn makes me question my sexuallity, although I know I'm straight and have never fantasised or engaged in gay sex. I've been with my girlfriend for 5 yrs and have children, we are happy together, but I definitly have some kind of mental problem.
I blush and get very anxious, sweaty and uncomfortable whenever I hear the word 'gay' or any other words associated to sexual orientation, such as 'coming out', 'straight' 'queen' etc - these words or phrases may just be being used to say something normal, like 'do you want to come out of that chair' - this will trigger me, I will get a spike, electric shock like feeling and then blush and feel anxious, sweaty for a good few minutes until I've managed to calm myself down.
This behaviour must have started when I was in my early twenties and has contiunued since, I've been strong to just try and ignore it and move on but now the fear of it happening prevents me from social occasions, with friends and family. I avoid sitting in rooms or restauarants with people or even in front of the TV in case I am exposed to hearing these words. When I used to work in an office, it was a daily nightmare!
Everyday, quite a few times a day I have thoughts go through my head saying, this must because your gay, but I know I'm not. I'm now very embarrised around gay people and sometimes just men in general. I find it hard getting together with my old friends, although most of them think I'm secretly gay becasue of my weird behavour whenever the subject comes up.
I don't have any gay sexual urges or want to see any gay material, would probably make more sense if I did, my problem is just a fear of hearing certain words or coming into contact with anything associated to homosexuaility. This is against my beliefs as I've had gay friends in the past and have absolutely nothing against people being gay, I think it's quite cool for people to have different sexualities, I just can't work out why my mind is constantly questioning mine, when I know I'm straight.
My question is - is this OCD or paranoia and if it is OCD should I go to the doctors and tell them everything - I've never even told my partner how I'm feeling, letunknown a complete stranger! It has had such a big effect on my life for so long that I really need to speak with someone, I want to talk with my girlfriend but just don't know where to start and feel it may make me even more anxious around the subject!

"I am a 42 year old woman, and my condition started very suddenly as soon as I started in first year at high school, putting me at about 11. I had been relatively happy till then. The problem was, my mother was a teacher at the same high school I was put into, and that's when things immediately fell apart, and I'm very sorry to say, I've never been able to overcome our relationship problems. I still have the same issues with my mother all these years later.
Don't get me wrong: I love her and she loves me, but there is a very ugly fly in the ointment which is like a wedge between us. My mother is now 75, and it has always been my ambition to prevail in this situation. As we never know how much time we have left together, I would dearly love to be healed permanently. This is the first time I have approached the public about it.
I put it down to the extreme stress I had of being a teacher's daughter, having no friends at school because I was so incurably shy that I couldn't strike up a conversation with anyone and make friends. So to put me in the same school, and class, as my mum, was just a really stupid idea, and totally lacking in foresight. The embarrassment was too much for me, and I really resented my mum. I was picked on by bullies for being so quiet, for being a teacher's daughter who didn't fight back. Perfect bully-fodder.
Essentially, the issue is this. For reasons I have never really understood, I developed an extreme intolerance to my mum's idiosyncrasies. Some of these are things which other people do, therefore this is normal behaviour. But for some reason, my mum's personality traits are often unbearable to me. My major issues are when she rubs her fingers together when she has crumbs on them, which happens a lot. Or claps her hands together when she handles crumbly food. The sound of this is unbearable, and I have to stick my fingers in my ears and look the other way.
The way she drinks is incredibly irritating, because of the unique way she does it. I have never seen anyone else do it this way. When I was again in 1st year in high school, my mum told me that for some reason, when she sat having coffee in the staffroom, one day she just couldn't help coffee running out of the sides of her mouth. So she developed a way of curling her lips inwards, as if to catch the coffee before it dribbled out. The crazy lip action drives me nuts, and I have to look away, and stick my fingers in my ears in case I hear her swallow or exhale after each gulp.
One more major thing, is she is a terrible one for using her hands excessively to express herself. She is almost like a ballerina, the way she so gracefully uses her fingers, hands and arms, tilting her head, everything is used to assist her to paint a picture when describing something. So if we are at an art gallery for example, and she is constantly pointing at things for me to look at, I just can't stand it, and have to look the other way. This all drives her nuts of course, and we have fought and rowed for nearly 30 years about it all.
There is one thing I have not mentioned so far, and I hate this part as I am so embarrassed by it. And it's the part which makes me think that this is a type of OCD. I am so severely irritated psychologically by her mannerisms, that to me it is as annoying as having head lice that you have to scratch, or it will drive you crazy if you don't deal with it. So the way I seek, and obtain, relief, is by doing the same as her; imitating her. So if she rubs her fingers together when she has crumbs on them, then I have to too. If she points, I have to point too, and so forth. I cannot tell you how upsetting her traits make me, that I have developed imitation as the only way I can seek relief. It is not 100% effective, but it's all I have. My mum all these years, thinks I've been targeting her to upset her. It took at lot of arguments and rows to make her see that it is not to do so, but purely to provide myself with relief, however small the quantity.
I live 5 hours drive from her, and that's the way I like it. I have a relatively good relationship with her. As I says, I love her and she loves me. We get on very well on the phone, but probably because I cannot see her on the phone.
I wish someone would tell me that I am not the only one who copies idiosyncrasies to seek relief from extreme irritation. I wish I could escape from it all, that we could go out for cake and coffee together without having to sit looking the other way with my fingers in my ears whenever she reaches for a biscuit. It sounds so ludicrous, I am actually laughing as I write this! I sound so crazy! Maybe I am a bit.
Would love to hear from anyone with similar experiences, or solutions. Thank you for reading this!

"Hi all. I usually visit these boards talking about my OCD, which I've had for ages and is finally under control thanks to a huge success with Clomipramine. As I was coming to the boards today, I noticed something on this thread about excessive scratching and realised I had to come and see.
For years, my entire life that I can remember, I have scratched at healthy skin. It usually happens late at night - I get an itch, scratch it, but the itch doesn't go away, so I keep scratching. Even when the itch has gone and I'm drawing blood, I can't seem to stop scratching. I remember a few years back when I did it so badly on the back of my hand I had to see a nurse at my GP's every day for a fortnight to dress the wound. I've recently done it terribly on my left leg shin - the weather is finally heating up but I can't wear skirts yet!
Surprisingly, I never really thought it was a problem until I noticed this board today and realised it might be more than a harmless personality quirk. I've never mentioned it to my doctor - I told them I'd fallen off my bike the time I had to see a nurse - but now I'm beginning to wonder if it's something more worrying. It doesn't happen often - once a month, max - but when it does happen, I do real damage. I'm a bit of a fashionista and love my beauty salon, so I tend to always have gel nail extentions - which, as you can imagine - are real weapons when this problem crops up. I can't stop getting the extensions - I'm a beauty journalist and have to keep up appearances - so I'm at a bit of a loss.
Does this sound like a problem? Do I need to see my GP? Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated!","['talking', 'OCD', 'Thought', 'fall']",['excessive'],"['talking', 'fall', 'Thought', 'excessive', 'OCD']",,1.0,,,

So at the moment every time I,m near some1 the spike comes in and then dread, so would it be stupid to actually want more of it so as not to worry if you do get it.

They are often frightening. I won't give any examples because I don't wany to spike anyone's OCD.

"Hello everyone. One of my biggest ocd themes is about me cheating.
About a year ago a co worker of mine had this sort of a crush on an other co worker. 
I used to tell him to go speak with her, maybe show a bit off. I guess i told him to to about just anything i might have done would i be him and not being a married man.
I now suddenly feel extremely bad, because i feel as if i might have been interested into her myself, but because i am married not did anything but sort of went along with my friend/co worker who liked her.
  I now feel extreme guilt towards my wife, i cannot seem to figure out what my intentions were.
Why did i got involved so much advising my. Co worker how to approach her talk with her etc etc. 
Deep inside i know i felt attracted to her aswell but being a married man i dont follow up to those feelings.

"When it comes to past mistakes I can't tell if I'm deserving to feel guilty or if I'm blowing this situation out of proportion, how are you supposed to tell? I'm worried that I'm blaming everything on OCD even if something I did was in fact very bad. For instance I remember in the past I pushed my cat on the head a few times and there's even some other moments I was mean to him. I feel sick to my stomach and hate myself for it and I'm not sure if this is OCD or I should continue to hate myself because I'm a dreadful person. I also had to confess to my mom but it didn't help very much as I feel like she doesn't understand and I fear that I'm an animal abuser because of what I did and she needs to understand. Also to add - OCD is making me fear what if I did more and can't remember? What if the stuff I did do makes me an animal abuser? My memories are so vivid but I am positive I was mean to him but I'm not sure just how much OCD is exploding this situation. I'm just at wits end right now, I can't treat this as something based on purely thoughts like with my other themes because I actually was horrible to my cat ;(","['serving', 'guilt', 'Thought', 'fear', 'OCD']",['theme'],"['fear', 'Thought', 'serving', 'theme', 'OCD', 'guilt']",1.0,,,,
"I've really wanted to post about this worry/fear for a few days but I'm not proud of it and it's put me off. But I entered into a discussion on someone else's post about logical fears/worries and I was so vague about what I was obsessing about and now I'm very confused with the advice (my fault for asking vague questions in someone else's post).
I have a very rational worry, which I will describe. When I found out that I was pregnant (my daughter is now 2), I was in CBT, on sertraline, signed off work and a heavy smoker (smoked loads to 'cope'). It was a surprise pregnancy, but the best news ever. I stopped smoking about 30- 40 cigarettes a day and went on an electronic cig with a high dose of nicotine. I discussed this with my GP and my consultant at hospital (I had a consultant-led pregnancy due to being over 40 and having OCD), they didn't question the e-cig use during pregnancy. I stopped regular fags for 1 month, had a major setback and had a few regular fags. I saw the consultant at the hospital and she said it was fine for me to have a few cigs a day and basically gave me permission so that I didn't put to much pressure on myself and cause anxiety. I returned to work, which is where all my OCD triggers at the time were and I had a few fags a day and used my e-cig at times too. 
When my daughter was born, I didn't want another fag and I 100% stopped, but I did continue with the e-cig, starting with a high dose of nicotine and gradually reducing the dose to the lowest dose, which is what I'm still on. I don't use it around my daughter but I breastfeed her and she still does breastfeed as this is the best thing for a developing infant. I wanted to stop smoking for her but nicotine is highly addictive si I needed something. 
I was aware that a small amount of nicotine gets transferred into breast milk but as NRT is stated as being safe for breastfeeding I thought it was ok and I was doing the best thing by not smoking. I have worried about the nicotine in breast milk before, looked it up online breastfeeding support websites and was reassured that risks were low and no adverse effects on infants reported and that the effects of the small exposure to nicotine are outweighed by the benefits of breastfeeding (and this was advice to mum's that smoke cigarettes, which I was not doing)
However, in the last week, I had the thought that the nicotine in my milk could be harming my daughter, for no reason though as she is happy, healthy, meeting all her milestones and more and she's only ever had a couple of colds in her 2 years. I felt so anxious (my OCD has been latching on to so much recently so I was anxious anyway, but I had a massive spike and started giggling effects of nicotine. I won't go through everything I found out of course, but some was reassuring (even though it was about smoking which I don't do anymore, but some was scarey. My scarey findings were mainly research done on rats etc and the effects of exposure to nicotine during pregnancy and lactation. It sent my anxiety and fear of me permantly harming my daughter's brain and organ development through the roof when I have only ever strived to be the best mum to her. (My OCD massively waned during the first 20 monts of her life so I didn't expose to it and I hide it from her now). The articles I read were scientific publications in journals and as I have an academic science background I could understand the main points they were making. I have read so many and gone back and re read so many times. I have spent hours researching. I have also been trying to calculate how much nicotine passes in to my milk and also researched the absorption rates of nicotine in e-cigs as there delivery system is different. I am taking solace from recent research where it's takes 35 mins of e-cig use to get the same level of nicotine as 1 fag. 
In general, I have read stuff that's reassured me but also stuff that's frightened me. I know I'm looking for an answer I can't have. When I've read something that reassures me, I have to look at the date of publication and then check that nothing new has been said/published since that date that would cancel out the reassurance, as in something new had been found out. 
I'm so scared I've affected the health and development of my daughter. I've asked my husband for a lot of reassurances and he's not worried at all and he just says 'look at her, there's nothing wrong with her. But I can't help but think that I've damaged her in ways we can't see and that will become evident at a later date (based in the research that I've read).
Is this my OCD as its a rational worry with grounds to be worried? Its not an illogical worry/fear. 
I'm sorry for all the detail, and thank you for reading.","['surprise', 'site', 'anxiety', 'anxiety', 'Thought', 'fear', 'OCD']",['spike'],"['surprise', 'anxiety', 'site', 'fear', 'Thought', 'spike', 'OCD']",1.0,,,,
"I just wanted to make a post on this website to get some support from others who know how I feel. For the longest time now, I've had the urge to touch things, or rub the edges of stuff. Like for example, if I touched my computer's screen 9 times out of 10 I'd literally 'feel' the edges and need to rub my hands to the edges of them to stop the feeling. This has been this way for many many years now, but recently it's taken a different approach. I feel an insufferable urge to touch other people's ankles. I've had this three times before, the first time was when I had a bad time with someone who was un justly living at my apartment, but it didn't last. The second time was on a particular Halloween, but there wasn't any reason for it, it was just acting up and the third was just a random time I saw my best friend leaning heavily on her legs, and that caused the feeling to flair up again. However, it came on again about 6 weeks ago and has been present ever since. Around the beginning of those 6 weeks, I was under  a lot of pressure thanks to University, and I chalked it up to that. I have since finished Uni for a while, and the feeling has faded dramatically, but it still spikes up now and then. When I'm not around people, I still feel the sensation, but as a strange empty region in my mind. Like, I want to rub it or touch it, but it's too far down in my mind to be able to properly do so. When someone IS around, the feeling locks onto their ankles, and it can get pretty distressing. It isn't that I want to do it, it's that I literally 'feel' it.
After I got on Holidays, I couldn't stand it any more and saw a doctor to have it officially diagnosed. I have no worrying symptoms of anything else and my neurological exam was perfect. She diagnosed it as OCD, and said if I want help alleviating this ankle feeling, to see a Psychologist, which I have twice. My Psychologist is confident that this strange ankle feeling will pass, as it has multiple times in the past, but she also said I should seek help from people who also have OCD, so here I am. I can deal with the normal OCD of wanting to rub things, or touch the edges of stuff, but this odd negative feeling in my mind is really getting to me, although it is easing up now.

"First off, I'm aware that I shouldn't come on here to seek reassurance, I'm having a bit of difficulty at the minute so just wondered if anyone else has dealt with this, and if so how they coped.
my biggest spike at the minute harm ocd, and this idea that i'm a terrible person.
i keep going through stages of feeling ok, but then even when I'm feeling good about something, it's like i start feeling guilty for feeling good then automatically go back to this idea that i'm a horrible person and i'm going to lose control. my spikes aren't as intense as they have been, as i'm telling myself it's the ocd and let it be there. but i've started ruminating about my actions in general, as though this is some indication, and am constantly second guessing myself. it's like i have no trust of the person i am, and am consumed by guilt. but i'm terrified of this idea of losing control.
i know that i don't like any of the thoughts, as they make me feel sick and horribly uneasy, and i know in my heart that i love all those around me and feel like i'm getting better some times, but then it comes back and it doesnt matter how much i believe the 'what if' aspect terrifies me. i saw my girlfriend for the first time in a few weeks this weekend, and it was wonderful. we had the nicest time and i just felt so optimistic. then about ten minutes before i she left to go back home i just got the horrible doubt in my mind. like the happinesss i was feeling was only temporary, that it wouldn't last. it's like everything, the thing i'm most positive about in my life can be overtaken with these question about 'what if' in life. i have aspirations of being a musician, but even that i've started obsessing over, thinking this is just a narcissistic desire i have. it's like everything i think about can be given a negative slant with this ocd.
has anyone else been through this kind of constant second guessing? this kind of catastrophic thinking is terrifying, and i'm worried i'll be with it for the rest of my life.
i'm going to see the doctor again this week, hopefully i'll be further on the list for CBT.

"Hello, I'm pretty new here. The main problems I have are excessive thinking about my b/f, whether I love him, whether he is the 'one' etc etc. I also have periods when I obsess about whether I am gay. I also worry about getting a disease quite a lot, but I know this is because I smoke, and am terrified of the damage I have already done to myself.
However, I seem to go through cycles. While one week I can feel pretty dreadful, I can then have a period of feeling pretty normal, or at least more in control. Sometimes this can last a couple of months at a time. Is this normal? I am just beginning to wonder if I even have OCD (I have never been diagnosed by a GP as I have had bad experiences), it's just that reading OCD forums are the only place I can feel I am not alone and I can relate so much to what other people write. I admit to using the forums for reassurance to some degree, but I also have spent hours surfing the web, when feeling bad, looking for articles that will tell me I definately love my boyfriend, or that I am not gay.
I know no-one here can give me a diagnosis for sure, but can anyone else tell me if they have better times?

"Hi All,
I was looking for a bit of advice please over what is 'normal' in the following scenario.
My son was cuddling up to me earlier today and his hand rested a couple of inches from my private parts. I panicked as i often do when he cuddles me as kids hands can tend to wander as they wriggle to get comfy he often asks can he sit on my knee.
Anyway i had a dilemma in trying to decide if his hand was 'too close' to my private parts as to be inappropriate, do i make him move his hand or allow him to keep it there? In the end i didn't get him to move it, and he re-adjusted himself anyway after a minute or so while i was fretting over this.
In the past i have got him to move his hand if i feel it's 'too close' to my private parts
For people without this theme of OCD what would you do in this situation?. There are a few things i struggle with as to what is normal. this type of thing is one of them.

"Hi, everyone. I needed to get some insight on my situation. This may be long and I do appreciate you reading. I have a lot bottled up.

I'm 21 and finishing up the last semester of my undergrad. I've had mental health problems for what I suspect to be for a while, but they've only gotten progressively worse for the past 5 years or so. I do believe that the stress of college/having more responsibility has something (or a lot) to do with this. I've never gotten professional help, mostly because I am still on my mother's insurance plan, and psychiatrists require permission from the insurance holder to get treatment. Unfortunately, my mother does not want to cooperate on this point. I do know there is something wrong with me. I just can't pin down exactly what.

For about three years, I had severe anxiety concerning whether I was gay or not. I do think this was OCD, because of the amount of mental rumination that I did. It was crippling. Eventually, I moved past this particular fear and went onto new things. I thought I was pregnant for about 6 months (on several occasions), despite multiple blood tests and doctors telling me otherwise. I did the same ruminating, checking symptoms on the internet, and etc.

I have three prominent issues right now: relationship and religious fears, along with fears of being in public.

I do believe that my potential relationship anxiety (or ROCD - if that's what it is) has ruined past relationships. Although those relationships would've ended eventually, I am sure, my fears ended them prematurely. Now, I am in a relationship with an amazing, loving man. He is supportive, accommodating, and tries to help me through all of my problems. I couldn't ask for anyone better and, on good days, I do consider him to be the person I want to be with permanently. However, good days are rare and usually I have horrible anxiety about my relationship. My mind says things like, """"""""You don't love him,"""""""" and """"""""break up with him."""""""" I worry that I'm in denial and can't accept that I need to end the relationship. Reading things about people breaking up is a major trigger for me, as is reading about people defining what a """"""""good"""""""" relationship is. Sometimes I think of myself with other people to see how I will react, and that utterly disgusts me. Deep inside, I have feelings of adoration for him. It's almost like all my emotions are caged inside this anxiety I have. It's all I can feel most of the time. It's particularly scary when I feel like I don't even know the person I love, because my anxiety is so horrible. I'm emotionally numb otherwise.

On top of this, I have had serious issues with religion. It should be noted that I am getting my BA in Philosophy and Religion, and this has upset my life in ways I didn't imagine. I went from being Christian, to essentially being Deist. I have a lot of feelings of doom, guilt, and etc. There have been a few times where I couldn't sleep at night because I felt like God/something supernatural was trying to send me messages/signs/etc. I would also watch for potential messages/signs. This really isn't pleasant for me (it may be for some people, I am sure). I am just terrified that I will have some sort of supernatural experience. I spend a lot of time ruminating about what the """"""""right"""""""" religion is, death, going to hell, and losing loved ones. I have frequent panic attacks/crying spells about this.

Finally, I have a very hard time being in public. I'm okay walking down streets and being in open air, but I struggle with inclosed areas, like classrooms, malls, and movie theaters. My boyfriend and I went to the movies last week and I had a full blown panic attack. I would say that I am very paranoid. I often look behind me, in closets, in my car trunk, and etc. I think about escape routes, survival plans, and the like. I know all this is not normal.

All these issues have resulted in me feeling utterly depressed. I don't feel real most of the time. I was driving in my car earlier and considered crashing it just to see what would happen because I felt so unreal. I don't have interest in anything. I was once a somewhat promising poet and won many awards, and now I can't come up with anything. I was once very career/goal oriented, and now I have put all plans to go to graduate school off. There is nothing inside me anymore. I've always had the tendency to pull my eyebrows out/pick at my skin, but recently I've begun eating my hair follicles, my scabs, and whatever I can pick off my face. I am so embarrassed to even admit this.

I know this was rather long and perhaps hard to follow, but I needed to get this out. Does anyone have any comments in general about my situation? Do I seem to have GAD, OCD, depression, or perhaps all three? Is that even possible? What can I do for myself? I really cannot deal with this anymore. I feel like my life is a waste.

Thank you so much for reading and thank you in advance for any comments.","['Treatment', 'Thought', 'checking', 'disgust', 'guilt', 'rash', 'interest', 'depression', 'OCD', 'fear', 'anxiety', 'anxiety', 'symptom']",['rumination'],"['rumination', 'anxiety', 'depression', 'Treatment', 'interest', 'disgust', 'Thought', 'checking', 'rash', 'fear', 'symptom', 'OCD', 'guilt']",1.0,,,,
"I'm getting into a bit of a mess at the moment, and I'd just like to hear other people's thoughts on my problems.
Brief history: I was diagnosed with depression when I was 17 (I'm 23 now), and put on Seroxat. Hospitalised twice, due to circumstances in my life that I just couldn't cope with. Been on and off Seroxat for depression since then.
Now, here's the thing:
I'm pretty sure that I suffer from OCD, but I've never been able to talk to any of my doctors about it and as such, do not have an official diagnosis. I feel absolutely mortified by the strange things I feel compelled to do, and I have this habit of underplaying my problems and not asking for help. When I was hospitalised with depression, I had to be dragged kicking and screaming, even though I knew I was ill - I only went because they threatened to section me otherwise. So, I've never actually gone to a mental health professional and said 'look, I think I have OCD'.
I can think of a couple of reasons for this reluctance - 1) because I find it next to impossible to open my mouth and actually talk about this to someone; it makes me want to run and hide my face, I just feel so ashamed and embarrassed. And 2) I'm convinced that a therapist would tell me that I'm wasting their time, and that someone more deserving could have that time instead. There are other things too…I think a lot of it comes down to me being scared, to be honest.
I'd just like to know if what I do sounds like OCD - for the past few years, I've thought of it in that way, but recently, I just feel so unsure of everything and I'm wondering if I should just shut up and get on with it. I'm currently trying to come off the Seroxat (got sick of sleepwalking through my life, and my depression appears to be under control), but I feel awful, and my partner thinks I should go to see a therapist. However, because of my fears (see above), I just don't know if I could / should.
Well, anyway, here's a rundown of my little 'rituals' and the reasons I do them. I've been doing some of them (in particular the checking of things to make sure they are safe) for years now, I can't even remember how far back this goes.
I am constantly tapping my fingers 9 times (3 with my right hand, 3 with my left and 3 with both hands together) on various objects, to make them feel 'safe'. For example, lightswitches, plug sockets, electrical appliances, the oven and hob, door knobs, locks, taps, etc etc, and sometimes, any object that I touch in a room. If I don't do this, the room feels 'unsafe', and I start to fear something disastrous happening, like a house fire, or a break in. I can't walk away and leave it, I have to go back and touch things. I also often make my boyfriend check things with me, to 'witness' that things are switched off or safe. I know that I'll start to feel anxious when I get into bed, so it helps when he can say 'it's all fine'.
The same goes for objects in my bedroom, before I go to sleep. I have a set routine of objects that I MUST touch 9 times before I get into bed. Otherwise, I'll lie awake and eventually, I'll have to get up and do it. I also have a big cushion on the bed that I lean on when I'm reading or watching tv - when I put this away to go to sleep, it must have the zip facing upwards, or I feel anxious. I think this is because I worry that the metal part of the zip will start a fire, by being close to a plug socket (I know that makes no sense).
Whenever I'm in the bathroom, I have to read the text on product packaging (bleach bottles, shower gel bottles etc) in a certain way. I'll read 9 different pieces of text 3 times each (most of my rituals involve the number 9). Again, if I don't do this, I have to go back and do it.
If I'm the last person out of the house / my office, I stand by the door pushing it (again, 9 times, 3 times on each hand and 3 together) to make sure it's shut and locked properly. I tap the keys on the locks (x 9). If I feel that I haven't done it properly, I have to go back and do it again. I've walked all the way up the road on my way home from work before, only to have to turn around and go back and check the door.
My partner works in central London, and a few years ago, I found myself developing a fear of him being killed on his way to or from work, so I then developed rituals to deal with this. First of all, I have to write my boyfriend a note, telling him to be careful and that I love him etc. I put this in his bag. Then, I walk in front of him out of the house, kiss him three times, and make him recite a list of 'things to look out for' (I'm cringing as I type this, because I know how thoroughly ridiculous this all sounds). This list is basically anything I can think of that might harm him, and he has to recite it to me and promise to be careful and watch out for the 'bad things'. I then kiss him 3 more times on the doorstep, and 3 more times outside the front gate. I wait until he's disappeared from sight, then I go back into the house. I keep my shoes on, go to find my mobile phone, and send him a text message to tell him to be careful again. Only then can I take my shoes off and start to relax. If I miss ANY part of this, I start to become anxious and worry that, because I've missed something, he will die. I also have this with other loved ones, where, if I'm thinking of them and I'm worried about them, if I don't do a ritual, I fear that something will happen to them.
Since lowering my Seroxat dose, I've noticed some horrible thoughts popping into my head as if from nowhere. I can be doing something perfectly normal, and a thought like 'you're going to go mad' will just pop into my head. I then get this feeling of losing control, like I really am going mad. It's hard to explain…it's like I can feel what it would be like to lose control of my thoughts and my life. And I start to panic, my heart starts pounding, and I have to go and sit down and try to calm myself.
I sometimes get another thought, similar in the way it just pops into my head, when I'm waiting for the train home from work. As it comes through the tunnel, I sometimes get this thought of 'go on, jump in front of the train'. And it's not like a suicidal thought, because as soon as I think it, I'm horrified. It's more like my mind is threatening to make me do it - does that make sense? And I have to move back from the edge of the platform and sit there thinking 'stay still' until the train has pulled up. I feel scared that this thought could one day overrule my conscious thoughts and make me do these things.
I also get a feeling sometimes that I'm going to say something inappropriate out loud, and it feels like I could do it at any moment. I try to control this thought, but it feels like it could still happen, like I don't have any control over it.
There's lots of other things I do that I feel could be related. Things like, If I'm writing an email to someone, I have to check it over and over and over again, to make sure that I haven't written anything that might offend them or make them think less of me.
I'm so sorry for writing such a horrendously long post, but I just want to know what other people think. Does this sound like OCD? Should I try to see someone, or would they think I was just wasting their time?","['shame', 'serving', 'checking', 'electrical appliance', 'bedroom', 'bathroom', 'office', 'outside', 'Suicidal', 'email', 'wasting', 'writing', 'Rituals', 'depression', 'OCD', 'fear', 'object', 'Thought']",[],"['outside', 'OCD', 'electrical appliance', 'bedroom', 'depression', 'office', 'email', 'wasting', 'checking', 'writing', 'Rituals', 'fear', 'object', 'shame', 'serving', 'Thought', 'bathroom', 'Suicidal']",,1.0,,,
"I just firstly want to say a big “hello!” to everyone, as I’m new here
I was wondering whether you could really help me out with something.
This is really hard for me to explain, and sorry if it’s long winded, but this is the first time I’ve really let it all spill out. For the last 6 or so years, since I was about 10, I’ve experienced these strong urges to carry out “rituals” in order to relieve myself of the feeling that if I do not carry out the ritual, something very bad will happen.
Some of the things I have to do are:
When I’m highlighting text on the computer, it must be highlighted in equal rows of 3 or 5.
If I make one mistake with a letter when I am writing, I have to correct that mistake and then go on to find and correct 2 more errors in that sentence.
I have eczema and can also get spots, and even though I’m really ashamed of it, I can spend up to an hour in the evening in the bathroom in a trance-like state just itching and picking, even if there wasn’t much wrong with my skin in the first place. At the time I can’t pull myself out of it, but afterwards I always feel terrible as my skin looks a mess and goes on to take a couple of days to fully heal.
I always have to check the door is locked 3 times whenever I enter or leave the house.
Occasionally, when I feel I have to blink to make these feelings go away, I have to do it 10 times.
If I make a point of touching something, I have to touch it 3 times.
I always have to check when I leave that I haven’t left anything behind in classrooms at school or public places, but I have to look back 3 times, so I have 3 separate pictures of the place in my mind.
When I’m playing sports I sometimes have to step between certain lines a certain number of times or do the blinking “for luck”. Although, I have tested this by not doing it, and have found that it does not affect my luck, so this isn’t much of an issue anymore.
I do a lot of counting in my head when I am doing some of these “rituals”, and it goes like this: 123 123 123 1 (adds to 10) and tends to make whatever the problem is “feel right”. Although this can sometimes increase up to 3 x 10 , 5 x 10, or very occasionally 10 x 10.
I am very conscious of myself and my appearance, which means that I have to check my appearance in 3 or 5 different mirrors.
I think the kids on my bus must think I’m weird, as I always have to brush the seat 3 sets of times before I can become comfortable and relax.
Occasionally, if I deliberately do a 360 degree turn in one direction, I then have to do the same in the opposite direction to “even it out”.
Sometimes when I get an undesired thought or image in my head, I have to point the palms of my hands away from my body and other objects and do the 123 123 123 1 thing in my head, as though I’m pushing the thoughts out of myself and away.
The final thing I can think of at the moment, is when I make a mistake when writing, first I must scribble it out, then put a single cross through it, and the a single line (with a pencil if possible).
I also have to check that my alarms are on 3 times, although this is one of the things I have really succeeded in reducing, as I used to have to check them 10 times or more, occasionally repeatedly for several minutes, which used to be very tiring.
You may have also noticed that everything has to be done in groups of 3s, 5s, (possibly 7s), and 10s, and then these numbers can also be added, but only to make certain numbers.
Another thing I have basically eliminated is a crucifix sign I used to make with my fingers when I was younger.
Whoa, that was a long list!
I am very secretive and discrete whenever I do these “rituals” (for lack of a better word), so doubt that anyone has really noticed, even though it can be very embarrassing and irritating.
So does anyone know what this is? Do I actually have OCD or is this just me being weird?
Some days it is really mild and I am hardly affected by these things. It is also much better than it used to be a few years back, as some rituals have disappeared and the frequency of others has decreased, although there are also new ones. So does that mean it (whatever it is) will go away by itself? Or do I need therapy? But I’m worried that it isn’t worth it. Do I actually have a problem? If I saw a professional they might think I’m being pathetic, over concerned, overreacting or making it up. Or is it so mild that it’s really not worth worrying about?
I told a friend about this approximately two years ago and she was supportive and tried to help me, but I haven’t spoken to her about it since. Apart from her, no one else knows. I’m afraid to tell my parents and relatives as I feel like I’d be letting them down, and I don’t want them to think of me differently or as some kind of mental-case (-no offence!). I’d just feel so stupid and embarrassed. I’m also worried about how my family would react and cope if I told them. One other little thing, would having ocd on my medical record mean that I couldn’t go into certain careers?
So there ya go! My big rambling speech is finally over!
I would really really appreciate it if you could give me some advice! Thank you so much.

"First, hi all! I've been lurking on these boards for a while and have found them very helpful and informative.
Apologies for the long post!
For quite a while I've been struggling with what I think might be some kind of mental illness or disorder. I remember being fairly young - probably 8 or 9 - and not wanting to go out or go to friend's houses because I was worried about family members dying.
I'm now 23. I've had a few strange behaviour patterns for years now (washing hands repeatedly, checking things, obsessing over order etc.) but things feel like they've escalated quite a bit in the last year or so.
I live about 120 miles from the rest of my family and I'm constantly worried that a certain family member is going to take ill or die. To try and """"""""prevent"""""""" this, I have to perform a certain action 7 times. This started out as touching or knocking on wood but over time I've started slapping myself in the face or knocking on my head with my knuckles.
I'm also a member of a professional body which requires a clean criminal record, which I have currently, but I'm terrified that I commit some offence. It worries me that this could happen so easily e.g. by being involved in a road traffic accident or having something wrong with my car which I don't know about which means that it is unroadworthy. Its now gotten to the point where I'm paranoid whenever I see the police as I think they're coming to arrest me. Again, the only way I can """"""""prevent"""""""" this is by knocking on wood or hitting myself. I'm convinced that this will happen sooner or later because I'm convinced that I'm basically a bad person deep down.
Does this sound like OCD, or something else? I've reached the stage where I can't stand things as they are any more.","['washing hands', 'checking', 'OCD']",[],"['checking', 'OCD', 'washing hands']",,1.0,,,
"I had unprotected sex with my girlfriend of 10 months for the first time last week and now Im scared I have aids. She is quite respectable (I know that doesnt matter) and told me she had unprotected sex with only her past steady boyfriends which is 2 or 3 guys. Now Im scared I have gotten aids but cant tell her that.
I have been struggling with homosexual themed ocd (hopefully that what it is) and last night I had a weird dream. This gay guy I know from high school was in the dream. I was being sexual in the in the dream with some kind of person. I couldnt make out if it was a man or a woman. I think it had the body of a woman but the gay guys face. I sometimes have these types of dreams where my brain fools me into thinking Im being with a woman and then I find out its a guy and I wake up with an erection and freak out.

"This is my first post, and my first time of describing my symptoms to other people. But anyway I think I have OCD.
It started when I was younger (early teens, whilst I am now 20). I started becoming obsessed with checking everything. I had to check applicianes were turned off 4 or 5 times. It steadily got worse, and nowadays I have to check everything is off in every single room in my flat before I can leave my flat. If I don't do it, I get so, so anxious that something will happen (there will be a fire, a flood etc). I can't physically leave my flat until I've done that.
I have to check things are in the correct place too, else I feel something bad will happen (I don't know what though). I constantly worry that if something's not in the correct place, something will happen.
I have to constantly think good thoughts whilst doing everything too, else I worry and get anxious that something bad will happen. I don't know how to describe it. If a bad thought pops into my mind, I have to re-do whatever I was doing replacing it with a good thought.
I'm finding it really hard to describe my symptoms, I don't know how to word them. I have a few more symptoms too, but those are the main ones.

"Good morning everyone, this is my first time on here.

So ive now decided to join this forum and explain my behaviours and see if anyone can shed a light on this.
1, If i walk down a path and one of my feet steps on a crack, then ive somehow got to step on another crack with my other foot, lots of silly things like this, if i bang my elbow i have to do it with the other.
2, if im thinking about something and a couple of words jump out at me ie. boy racer, then i try and say it in my head in different ways altering either the first 2 letters or the last 2, or saying it backwards, i know all my car registrations, but i also know them backwards as well, once i get one in to my head, i say it over n over again in different ways, but only for a short time.
3, Im a bit of a perfectionist
4, I eat my food in a certain way which has been noticed by otheres.
5, As for the cleansing and washing hands, i do kinda do that at times especially if ive touched something and i dont know what it is.
6, If i wash my hair and it doesnt go right after ive brushed it, ill go wash it again until it is right, im quite bad with that, it has to be perfect.
I hope i havnt bored you with the details but this is basic examples of what i do, somethings i do daily and others i dont.

-rubbing or shaking of hands when something """"""""dirty"""""""" is seen to stop contamination
-thinking that objects can be """"""""hurt"""""""" when they are bumped into and having to go back to """"""""kiss them better"""""""" or say things that would stop them hurting

-having to react to show respect when hearing about people dying (this even has to happen when hearing about it on the news or on the radio, so that the radio or TV has to be switched off during the news so that the actions can be avoided)
other things that are done that i didn't really think of as being significantly illogical before i read anything on this site include hoarding, excessive washing of hands, checking to see if hair-straightners are switched off even though it is KNOWN that they are...
that's all the symptoms i can think of right now.

"Hi everyone,
I've been struggling with what I think is OCD for the past few years now, maybe around 6/7 actually.
It began when I was about 12 and on holiday. It was the last night and I'd got out of bed for a drink, when I looked out of the window and saw these fancy lights on a building outside that I hadn't noticed before. I didn't really think anything of it and went back to bed. But then out of nowhere I started thinking 'that will be the last time I ever see those lights' (due to it being the last night of the holiday) and suddenly thought if I didn't go to the kitchen again and look at the lights someone I know would die. I tried to resist but then thought 'think how guilty you would feel if that person did die and it would be all your fault'. It felt really strange and I got out of bed and looked at the lights. I went back to bed with these same recurring thoughts and eventually went to sleep and the next day didn't really think anything of it.
Months later whenever I did anything such as put something in the bin (like a biscuit wrapper) I got these strange feelings that I had to go back and touch it again. I can't quite remember if it was to stop someone dying or for another related reason. One time I tried to resist it but failed but the binliner had already been taken outside so I went out to do it. :blushing:
I kept on having these strange habits and it was like I couldn't tell the difference between a normal habit that people have or an OCD habit.
The first time I thought it might be OCD was when in the news it was about David Beckham suffering from it. Although I had different symptoms, the article described typical OCD symptoms and they described what I had been going through.
It was at its' worst when I was about 16 and for some reason I had got it in my head that if I didn't do these little rituals (such as going up and down the stairs a certain number of times, or switching lights on or off) I would have a heart-attack. It felt so real as though it was certain to happen. I Got over the worry of dying though but now it has changed slightly.
I've got this thing where I don't like a certain number (don't wanna type it for obvious reasons ) where literally everything I do (such as turn the TV on) is the 1 number before my bad number, which means the next time I do the same thing, it is the bad number. So I have turn the TV off and on again to get past it. So for example if the number was 5 I would turn the TV on and think '4' but the fear of '5' being next means I turn it off and on twice more to get to '6'. But then the cycle just starts again so it's an ongoing thing. If I try to resist it I just feel awful. Although I find it much easier to cope with during the day when I just try and forget about it. Also I do this strange thing where almost everyone I know is given a number near my bad number and I've gotta think of the right person because of the right number when I'm doing it, if that makes sense. It is like I have forgotten how to think normally, like I used to before all this happened.
It is really bad at night time though. I keep on doing the number thing with my light switch but because I am just going to bed I struggle to keep my mind of it to the point where at some nights I'm in and out of bed about 20 times trying to get it right.
My brother knows and kinda helps and my dad knows aswell. But the amount of times one of them says 'just try not to do it' gets me pretty annoyed. But they don't know the true extent of it all, they just think I like to turn things on and off alot.
I'm 18 and going to Uni in a few weeks and I'm abit worried about how I will cope with all this. Of course, it may not be OCD. I'm pretty sure it is though. Do you guys think it is?
Sorry for the long post but I've just wanted to get it off my chest.

"Hi guys. I broke up with my boyfriend of nearly 2 years recently and im having trouble coming to terms with it - having relationship based ocd which confuses me to no end and i think was a massive reason in us breaking up. I have been feeling so incredibly sad since then, i have a very tight feeling in my chest like someone is squeezing my heart and all i can think about is how much i love him and how much i have lost and that i know it was the right reason to break up because we were under so much stress, but i still have this hope that we will get back together in the future at some point. Anyway, another massive part of my ocd focuses on this guy i met on holiday and basically my ocd telling me to be with him and that we had a better connection that me and my boyfriend... So i was just thinking about my breakup and thinking about how it was a nice breakup and we still cared for each other and i then i had the sensation that 'ok this relationship has been brough nicely to an end, now i have the freedom to go and find this other man that is right for me and that i should be with'
But i know that i dont want to be with this man!!! But it honestly feels like i do and i have no real anxiety around it because im on medication, i just feel like the thoughts are much less easy to distinguish and are more like feelings and urges and are a part of me rather than thoughts that spike my anxiety and leave, they seem to linger there not causing much anxiety. Anyway i dont like this thought that 'now i have the chance to grow and be the person i should be with this other man' it sucks!!

"Hi all,

I know ive been visiting the forums a lot lately, and i know i have OCD etc.

But one of my ocd themes or at least the most worst one i have is real event ocd. And now this has latched itself onto another thing from the past. I guess about 6 -7 years ago when i was like 23 -24 ish years old i used to go to this bodybuilding forum because i was very actively working out and stuff. 

On this forum they had a 18+ section with topics where people would post pictures of naked and semi naked woman, at the time i had a high sex dive and i would just go trough all those topics while masturbating (i feel ashamed saying this btw). But some or at least on or 2 of those topics also had what they called 'barely legal or jailbait' pics in them, at the time i did not think much of it since i did not really had any ocd or so... so when going trough these topics while i was masturbating i also did that when those 'barely legal or jailbait' pics came by.

As far as i can remember i never went looking for pics or vids from younger woman specifically at the time, and i never have and still not felt really attracted to younger woman or girls if you would like to call it that way. But the fact remains that i did masturbate to a series of pics where also those pics im talking about here were in between and i revisited those topics a couple of times as well... knowing what kind of pics were there.

All this flared up this morning after seeing a tv series where i man gets caught webcamming with an underaged girl. this suddenly made me go into panic mode and convincing me im a pedophile.

In reaction to that i looked up some pics of adult woman to see if i could get aroused, and  id did just to reassure myself. But im not convinced yet!

Oh and btw, i searched the forums for 'jailbait' and could not find anything except a post i posted o nthe forums myself i nthe past, which makes me think im really a pedofhile since noone with ocd has ever seen that before.

How do i deal with this? i could really need some advise please. im so anxious right now!


PS: At this moment im looking up the forums again and trying to search for the topics i found all those years back if the pics really were that bad.. i just need to know!!

"I've had OCD about my sexuality for so many years. I'm a 23 year old female and this started five years ago, when I was 18. I always considered myself straight and was always into boys, but a friend told me he was gay and it got me questioning myself for some reason. At first I thought it would be cool to be bi because it seemed so fashionable and I was curious what it would be like to kiss a girl. I started going from thinking it would be cool to be bi, to what if I'm a lesbian and I started questioning myself and worrying about it. I got my first boyfriend and I started thinking what if I'm a lesbian, but then I really grew to like him and it kind of went away. We didn't date for long and I took the break up really hard.
A few months after the break up I was drunk and I got with this girl. This was 4 years ago when I was 19. Ever since then I became so depressed and worried about my sexuality. I freaked out afterwards and was upset, but I wrote on yahoo that I enjoyed getting with the girl, but I can't remember. I was really drunk and confused. I remember the day after I was really upset and confused and scared I was a lesbian? I feel so anxious and depressed thinking about what happened with the girl; the greatest anxiety is thinking that I """"""""enjoyed"""""""" that incident. I keep analysing what happened in my head. I'll post the link I posted on yahoo after the thing with the girl happened.

Sorry for all the links. Ever since I've obsessed about my sexuality and it's made me so depressed and anxious. The idea of being with or getting with a girl makes me feel anxious, depressed and makes me want to kill myself. I know that there's nothing wrong with being with a girl and that my family and friends and others around me would accept me, but the idea of being with a girl fills me with dread. I keep thinking what if I'm denial and I really enjoyed that experience and am not interested in men?
I've always had crushes on guys growing up but I keep analysing my past and doubting if my crushes on guys were ever real. I've always wanted a boyfriend, but unfortunately I've never had much luck with guys as they only want one thing and they don't take me seriously. I get really upset and low when I get rejected by a guy.
What makes me think I'm a lesbian is that the times I've had sex have been one nights stands or when I have had sex sober I wasn't really into the guy that much and didn't enjoy it much. When I've had one night stands I don't remember much, but I have gotten with guys who I don't find attractive sober, but I'm all over them when drunk because I get horny. I don't have one night stands anymore, very rarely because I want a guy to treat me properly. I think going to an all girls school also has contributed to my ocd about sexuality, because I craved the company of boys and my school was very strict and didn't like us being around boys. Plus I didn't have any friends and didn't get a chance to meet any boys.
I keep mentally testing sexual scenarios with a female in my mind and this causes me a lot of distress and anxiety. I feel helpless and I feel like I want to die especially when it seems like I could enjoy doing stuff with a female when I test it in my mind. I spend so long mentally testing that it takes over my life and it wastes so much time. I'm so scared that I could want to do stuff with a girl again and worse, enjoy it. I don't think I'd be able to go through with doing stuff with a girl again, even if very drunk.
Do I sound like I have ocd? I hope I'm not bi either. Do I sound bi?
I also have had other ocd themes like ocd about being a paedo and fears about my health. I also go through phases where I feel a lot better and phases where my OCD really flares up and I feel so distressed and on edge, like I can't stop analysing about that thing with the girl and I keep mentally testing and it seems like I could enjoy doing stuff with a girl!","['Thought', 'interest', 'hope', 'fear', 'anxiety', 'anxiety', 'OCD', 'joy']",['theme'],"['anxiety', 'OCD', 'interest', 'fear', 'Thought', 'joy', 'theme', 'hope']",1.0,,,,
"Morning everyone, I just need a bit of outside advice really.
I had a spike this morning, I knew what it was and as the usual ruminating began I applied all the stuff I've been learning and it waned to about 50%. I'm a bit worried though because it only properly went (though not 100% as it's still lingering a tiny bit) when I came on the internet.
Does this mean I'm now using the net and all the OCD information as reassurance? I know I get relief from doing it and it cuts the anxiety down, but I'm not sure if it's because I'm taking the information in while it's happening and applying the techniques as I'm reading. It could be a distraction I spose, albeit a very connected distraction.
Does this sound like reassurance to you? Am I reassuring myself that these thoughts mean nothing?
I know it can be easier to spot something in someone elses situation when you're viewing it from the outside so any replies are more that welcome.

"Hi.
I'm seeing my CBT person tonight for the second time. I was a bit annoyed that she didn't give me any measures last week to tackle this. What she asked me to do was think of what ways I try to rid myself of the thoughts or provide relief?
Alot of the time I try to allow them to be there as awful as they are, but other times I tell myself I'm being silly and of course Id never hurt my kids. I look at the fact I haven't always felt this way. I tell myself I know I'm not a paedophile. When I see my kids undressed for bed or bath I question how this is making me feel. I tell myself that if I did do it, I would kill myself because its so awful.
Can anyone tell me if these are mental rituals or if this is a normal way to neutralise the crazy thoughts??

"Yeah so sometimes I'll get OCD thoughts that keep popping up and won't go away so I'll try to make a list of reasons or search for a good reason why the thought isn't true and when I find it, it usually calms me down but sometimes I'll get more OCD thoughts trying to dissprove my truth.
This is probably rumination so how should I stop when the thoughts keep coming and making me feel anxious?","['OCD', 'Thought']",['rumination'],"['rumination', 'Thought', 'OCD']",1.0,,,,
"Hello Friends..
I'm Naval from country India. having ocd for the last 15 years,and now pure o(from 2 years) with some form of rituals.
I'm passing with one critical problem at night.Since 2-3 month I feel restless at night.Unlimited meaningless thoughts come in mind,when i make sleep.this process runs in my mind throughout the night..only i get free when left my bed.
Even same unlimited dreams thoughts come in day if i make sleep.
As a result i not feel freshness and i'm sure i'm lossing my memory too.
Is this common or a deep sleep?
Is there any need to worry it?
or
this is why i have ocd for a long time?
one more things i would like to say.. i am not taking any kind of medicine since 1 year.
also i don't want to take any medication.i really hate it.
is this possible to come out this problem without taking any medication like diazapam etc..?
treatments is most welcome..& sorry for my English.

"just a warning, this is a bit of """"""""gross"""""""" habit that i have.
i've been diagnosed with OCD and am taking medication, but before i realised i suffered from it (when my rituals and contamination fears started to get really bad) i used to mess around with my skin a lot. i wouldn't necessarily call it skin picking, but what i would do is have a shower/bath, and then i would scratch a certain part of my body where i would pick up dead skin cells. this is all i would do, but a short while after i began to eat the skin cells too. later when it got really bad, like in public, i would quickly lick my finger (i learned to do it super fast so no one noticed) and rub my skin where i would try and get the same result when my skin was totally wet. i stopped for a while but then it came back out of no where. whenever i had baths i noticed how the dirt/dead skin cells would accumulate and create rings around the bath. i would then scratch at it, picking up the dirt in my nails, and later eating it as well. now i'm back to rubbing my skin to get dead skin cells as well as eating my skin cells from my bath. does this count as skin picking? sometimes i scratch myself and bleed, like on my back and stuff, but i'm not trying to achieve a scar, i just want my skin cells.
ugh, i don't know what this is or how to stop it. i enjoy it so much that i really don't want a cure. thanks in advance to anyone who can give me some advice.","['OCD', 'Medication', 'Rituals', 'fear', 'joy']",[],"['fear', 'Rituals', 'joy', 'Medication', 'OCD']",,1.0,,,
"When I was younger I suffered from OCD and while it was mild I still got very little sleep from panicking about rituals and if I did them correctly. Over time I managed to control it and it seemed i grew out of it.
However, now when it comes up to exam times when I am stressed. I get the same 'feeling' as I did when I was young. Its almost a sense of impending doom and it terrifies me and and although I dont do any rituals like I did when I was young only becuase now that I am older its easier to be a bit more rational. Im worried it could get worse.
Iv heard about Stress related OCD, is this what it could be? If so what can I do. I thought this was all behind me and it seems like it isnt. I really need some advice.

"I have very servere ocd and and my rituals take up more than 7 hours a day. For example i always take a screenshot every second minute on my computer and phone. And i take a screenshot whenever i finish a sentence. And when i take the screenshot with my phone i always have to stand up and eat some of my hair and then do a movement that takes 20 seconds and the i have to say certain stuff. I sometimes have to wait 2 hours for the bus, like if my buss comes in 20 minutes then i have to stand and clap for 30 minutes without moving so i miss the buss, and then i have to wait for some hours. I always have to close my eyes if i walk over something, like if the ground is not completely flat.I have a glass in my room in a box, sometimes i have to go home from school and touch it 333 times, so it makes my grades worse, because i bank of school. And when i try to sleep i always have to lie in a special way, which is very uncomfortable, and when im about to sleep i get a thought that i must go down and do something, so i never fall asleep. Some days i have to pull all nighters and then go to school the next day. Sometimes i have to say very bad things or touch some random people. Is there any medication to atleast calm these symptoms down a little?

"Hello everyone I’m new to this forum but not to ocd forums in general, I’ve been scrolling through endless of them since last hear and I can’t seem to get better. Just a little background before I explain how I feel: I am a gay male, I’m 19 years old, and since I can remember I always liked being a guy but almost a year ago I watched a documentary about gender and I imagined myself as female; this led to my first panic attack, my head was dizzy my hands felt cold and I couldn’t even breathe because of how anxious I was and since then the “what if you are trans” though has been haunting me. There are days when I feel a bit better but days when I feel absolutely awful and I don’t know what to do. I always had a bit of an obsessive behavior but I’ve never been to therapy so I’m not diagnosed; for example I had and still have an irrational fear of diseases making me or my family members die, like someone close to me could have a sore throat and I would ruminate on what’s the chance of them having a deadly disease and I literally panic about it, or I had a fear of being kidnapped when I was a child, or that burglars would try to get into our house (I know it’s dumb but I was so worried). Since I had the trans thoughts it only switched themes once or twice: the first time I remember I obsessed for two weeks or so about being a psychopath and that I was doomed to hurt somebody and the second time I was really scared for one of My loved one’s health. What I’m saying is that I had other themes but the transgender one is far the worst; I can’t even look at myself after I take a shower without questioning if I genuinely like my body or if I like it because I don’t want to accept the fact that I would prefer being I woman, I question myself every time I see a girl  or whenever someone talks about gender, I wake up everyday with this worry I don’t know what to do. The problem is that I have found proofs in my childhood that I might be trans: I always preferred girls toys, I always connected more to female characters in movies and cartoons and often played as female in videogames, I always liked girly music and stuff and to this day I’m a bit feminine but I don’t want to wear female clothes or to have long hair, I like my body how it is. I just have this voice in my head constantly telling me that I would be happier I was a girl and it freaks me out, I had a really hard time accepting my sexuality what if this is all over again? I would rather be dead than to be trans, it would ruin my life, not because of what people would think but because I don’t like it, I’m repulsed by it and I just want to go back to how it was I don’t feel like I realized something I just feel like I’m doomed to be trans. Please anyone tell me I am not I really need this.
also I just want to point out that i have nothing against trans people and lgbtq people in general, I’m proud to be part of this awesome community but I’m just so worried and I’m sorry if I offended anyone","['dizziness', 'OCD', 'behavior', 'Thought', 'fear', 'disease', 'Employment']","['theme', 'irrational', 'obsessive']","['disease', 'obsessive', 'Employment', 'fear', 'Thought', 'irrational', 'behavior', 'dizziness', 'theme', 'OCD']",1.0,,,,

"I would like to note first that probably it would be better for anyone who has severe OCD or OCD not to read my post as I feel it may be dangerous.
Anyway,
Before, almost a year and half ago, I had the normal OCD problems that have to do with repetition and all and washing hands till they became like my Grandma's hands, closing doors several times ( mostly at number 5,10,15), not changing the channel until I read the whole subtitles and various of those. They were tiring but I never went to a doctor. I thought I was a psycho and I just kept it to myself. They eventually faded although it was kind of depressing because I got stressed trying to fight it with all these urges to do things. But after a while I got better.
Suddenly now it's much more severe. I don't know if it's related to OCD but here is the problem: I stop myself from thinking about everything. Whenever I put my head to think about something, even if it is very simple and needs no logic, the disorder kicks in and bang I'm back to the start. It happens every second so it's not like a random brain malfunction. It is """"""""organized"""""""" and annoying. Ever since six months and it has been happening.It's really killing me. I feel like a total idiot. Sometimes it kicks in when I'm talking to someone and I start the sentence then I remember to blank out so I blank out and can't even begin to put a sentence together. When I'm doing a test or quiz, I'm struggling. I can solve everything that is on the surface, but when it needs a couple of thoughts linked together even if something is very simple and I know I can solve it so easily, I go back to the start and have to think of it again. I told me mother about it but she thought I'm giving her an excuse so that she won't blame me when I don't get good grades. So I don't know what to do. However, my biggest question is : is it OCD or is it something else like a brain disease. This is my last year at school and I have important tests before I can go to college so I hope someone can help. If it is OCD I might be in deep trouble. If it's a brain disease, hopefully I can fix it.
I said my post was dangerous because people with OCD might actually do the same that I'm doing. I did'nt even want to tell anyone about it but I told my mother for some reason and she is still the same; she didn't suffer from this. So I felt it is safe to tell other people who can help.
It is really annoying that even writing this post I had a lot of those """"""""stops and rewinds"""""""".

I am struggling everyday o get up and shower and have constant negative thoughts which I try and fight. I struggle to see people as one experience recently has set me back. I went out with Uni friends for first time ever and had a fab night out but it resulted in the next day feeling guilty with panic attacks that I had been too flirty. I seeking reassurance ( I know bad) told my boyfriend who was amazing ( as he knows my illness). Anywho it set me back and just feel like a constant failure all the time.

"Hi,
I actually have wrote a message similar to this a bunch of times.But I've been a bit scared about approaching the subject with you because I've been afraid that you might judge me badly on it.
So you guys know I've got a thing about urine and excrement. I have mentioned this to you countless times, both my own and anyone else's including that of my brothers. One thing that I have mentioned less is something I feel slightly uncomfortable about broaching but I need to ask advice. It's a bit sex related so anyone who doesn't feel comfortable about this should probably go now.
So the issue revolves primarily around my genital area and semen. I am extremely uncomfortable with it essentially. To the point that I actually do not even """"""""do stuff"""""""" because I don't want the contaminant on my hands despite the fact that I've had doctors both say they are concerned that I don't do it and that I should.  The problem is I can't touch it. And the issue now is that I am getting aroused quite often because I am not doing anything and every time as much as my bits touch anything, I freak out. I also have this fear that when I am browsing on my phone, that if someone turns me on, then my phone may touch it and then I've got stuff on my phone so I am wiping my phone 20 odd times a day in worry that I have any fluid on that.  I am actually a loss of what to do because if I ever got anything on my hands like that, I couldn't even as much as open a door to go wash my hands because I couldn't touch anything with contaminated hands. So it's a bit of a non-starter. It's so awkward mentioning this to to a therapist because it's not something you can really do face to face with someone. I also worry about other people doing it (especially my brother) and then not washing his hands and touching stuff which obviously is distressing. 
I feel like the only way to get round this is to actually do exposure but that's going to mean potentially getting stuff on my door handle and the reaction to that would be to wipe it immediately a thousand times over because I'm grossed out by it. 
You know, I really feel at Christmas time my OCD is making me very low. I've already been off for a few days and OCD has dominated everything. It's ridiculous.","['fear', 'open door', 'washing hands', 'OCD']",[],"['fear', 'open door', 'OCD', 'washing hands']",,1.0,,,
"A couple weeks ago it looked like my OCD symptoms were finally starting to recede. I could actively avoid thinking about my recent theme (which basically involves immense guilt over an act that took place when I was a teen and a certainty that I am evil: http://www.ocdforums.org/index.php?showtopic=67426)and when I did think about it, I reasoned that it was a silly mistake that was not worth stressing over. This followed a recent increase of one of my meds to the highest dose, and I was optimistic that I was finally experiencing effective treatment. But a few days ago, my symptoms re-appeared just as bad as ever - this coincided with the arrival of the brutal PMS symptoms I have every month. My OCD is usually worse during this time, but could PMS have such an impact that it renders the drugs useless? Now I'm worried that it was all just a delusion that lasted a couple weeks and that I actually AM a horrible, disgusting human being. Some people are horrible and disgusting, and feeling bad now doesn't mean I'm not one of them. I have also been very depressed these past few days, finding no interest in anything. I've been unable to focus at all - even on half hour TV programs - and I have no motivation to do anything. Everything seems pointless, and when I consider activities that might help my depression, I remember that I am a horrible person who doesn't deserve to feel good. My life feels like a colossal waste. I have never had a romantic relationship (I'm in my 20s) because of how much I hate myself. I don't want to force that on someone else. Very few people know of my struggles, and those that do think it's a mere quirk - they don't know the hell I go through. But then, why am I complaining, if I deserve this? It still feels bad. But bad people can feel bad and guilty. I just wish I could have a new life and undo what I've done. I still have my period (sorry for the TMI) and at first I tried to tell myself """"""""it's just PMS, it's making you crazy"""""""" but now I think it won't go away and that this is how I truly should feel.

"Hi
I'm a 27 year old male from London and suffered with severe contamination OCD since 2010. I have realised through counciling that I have had other traits since my early teens. My mother died of Leukaemia when I was five and my father met a new partner less than a year after. I suffered mental and physical abuse from my step mother untill I left home at 16 and my father always blamed me for the problems which arose.
While on my own my rituals and routines became more important to me as a reassurance to keep me safe. In 2009 my father contracted a horrifying rare disease called Scleroderma in which the immune system attacks it's own body and eventually kills it thinking its a foreign invader.
Ironically my fathers partner left him when he became useless to her and I was left with a front row seat as my fathers body deteriorated by the day. We received no answers from any medical expert and no positive outlook for my fathers future. That's when my OCD began to spiral out of control.
I started to scrub my hands and body clean repeatedly any time I had to touch my father and any where he had been sitting as I became terrified of catching the desease. I had to do my own research on the causes of Scleroderma to try and find that reassurance and it was the worst thing I ever did to my self. I was informed that solvents, paints, varnishes, glues, hair dyes, etc could be causes of this or maybe some kind of infection or bacteria. This completely sent me off the rails and my mental Health started to deteriorate from then on.
My father passed away in 2010 about 9 months after contracting Scleroderma, he basically just gave up. I remember one of the last things that stuck in my head what he said to me was """"""""I'd rather be dying of cancer than this, at least Id know where I stand"""""""". Laterally 24 hours after my fathers death my fathers family sensed how ill I became from it and decided to demand money from me thinking my father had money and they was entitled to it. That's when I knew I had to just get away. After my dissaperance my fathers house was broken into and my mothers wedding and engagement ring was stolen. My father kept this in a safe place for me to have so I knew it was he's family who did this as they must have known the location.
The break in broke me completely and I was contemplating suicide for six months. This brings me up to now and I have to give up my carrier as an electrician because of the paints, chemicals etc associated with Scleroderma. I can't touch anything unfamiliar to me or anything anybody else has touched. I don't shake hands. If I smell anything like paints, solvents, harsh cleaning products I freak out! I shower up to 4 times a day. I brush my teeth up to 4 times a day. Here's what's keeping me in this revolving door, I'm staying in a run down council block where nobody cares for basic hygiene it literally makes me shudder and hold my breath when I have to step outside. I have to wrap my hands in kitchen towel to leave the block it's that bad! The latest incident is I see a mouse out of nowhere run under the couch I've been sleeping on untill recently! The pest control professional believed it had come through the pipes leading to next door as he could not see any evidence of a mouse. I normally would mop and hover everywhere daily but now I do not want to touch anything, my hands are cracked and bleeding from scrubbing, I can't use any cutlery, plates etc, and most importantly I do not want to sleep here!
So that's how it has been for me in the last few years, I received CBT but i didn't feel it made any difference. I don't know what my next move is. I can't get off this revolving door and escape this living nightmare, I feel completly alone and helpless.
I'm glad I'm able to discuss my situation openly on here and getting my issues of my chest. Any help/pointers in the right direction I would be very grateful.

I was doing decent for the past year and then suddenly two weeks ago I got sick. i said to myself, ok do not give into the ocd thoughts. But they were too strong and they got a hold of me. I obsess about the obsessing the most. So damm hard, I think to myself what if I get cancer. It is not the cancer I fear but the constant, agonizing obsessing I will do about it. I guess I fear the disease itself. Another spike that sent me off was fearing my parants turning 58 this summer. Never thought about them being older before and possibly loosing them, now it is killing me to and I cannot stop thinking about it. I guess my question is, how do I stop obsessing if the things i worry about the most could or may happen. How does one become comfortable with that.

"This week is OCD Awareness Week, and each day we will be publishing a different account of Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder.
Today Kirstie @ittywoof bravely shares her recent experiences of OCD and how it's currently imapcting on her.
So the past few weeks have been pretty unkind to my family. Our pet dog suddenly died after a routine medical procedure, we also went through a month long miscarriage and all whilst dealing with a poorly toddler (and our wedding happening 6 weeks later!). It was clear the OCD was going to rear its ugly head. Stress is a huge trigger for OCD.
The running theme through all this was grief and loss. Now for the OCD this is like a red rag to a bull. Especially, considering at the root of my OCD was the fear of losing loved ones. Having no control over any of these scenarios and trying to function on a day to day basis I admit has been a struggle for us a family. Each scenario on there own is something that is often not spoken about.
""""""""I think it's important that we speak up and share when we are struggling.""""""""
Often the feelings of shame, embarrassment, not wanting to admit that you're struggling or out of fear that you'll be viewed as a failure stops us from talking about our experiences. However, I think it's important that we speak up and share when we are struggling. It's equally as important as sharing the good times.
It's OCD Awareness Week from 9th -15th October 2016. OCD is often stigmatised and stereotyped by many and viewed as 'the cleaning condition' or the term is used to label someone who likes to be tidy! It's not often viewed as a serious and debilitating condition.
Obsessive Compulsive Disorder is so much more than the myths and stereotypes. The chaos and destruction it can cause in people's lives can be frankly devastating. However, the more we raise awareness and share our experiences of OCD it helps to reduce the stereotypes and stigma associated with the condition.
Whilst OCD can be a serious and debilitating mental health condition, its important to remember it is also something that can be recovered from with the right treatments such as Cognitive Behavioural Therapy.
Whilst the OCD has given me a tough time this month; through seeking support and sharing my experiences I know I'm going to overcome this.

"Hi all,
Yes me again! these thoughts and the physical anxiety I am experiencing are seriously me off and have REALLY gotten me down now!
I go to bed and wake up dreading each day that lays ahead, worrying what will pop into my head next! Trying to keep things in perspective, keep busy etc, but it just wont go away or leave me alone!
Every one keeps saying happy new year and I feel like replying, """"""""no, its just gonna be like the last one, and the one before that.... """"""""
I am worried not just about these thoughts and rumination etc but how I am gonna pay the mortage (the years insurance payment cover plan has just expired), if I got work could I cope?, will I still be able to the hobbies I enjoy so much? (don't want to give them up), would mum be ok?
I don't sleep well and have not for a long time now and am sick of worrying I don't have this condition when I have been told I do!
I worry if the thoughts are intrusive or if I actually thought them, am so lonely its untrue, but feel it would'nt be fair to 'burden' someone with me at the moment, plus some of the thoughts disturb me so much it unreal!
I never imagined when I was growing up things would end up like this! I get thoughts like 'just give you can't win' coming in now, its so frightening!
Please, don't think I am here for pity, I am NOT!, but as I read in a post the other day, its like being that film Groundhog Day, thats how it feels!
I hope some of your are fairing a bit better at the moment,

Im in desperate need of help, like a lot of us on here. I cope because i have to, but everyday is so low, unhappy and 'the same'. I suffer massively from false memory, and i do not get a break. Ive started to gain paranoria just to make things worse. Ive also noticed my health detetiorate excessively, my eye sight is hetting worse, i get extreme headaches and i feel i could sleep for days. I am also very worried at how i struggle to listen to people and how forgetful i am.
I have unhealthy relationships with family and friends, and terrible relationships with ex partners because of my problem. Going to work is becoming to hard to cope with. Getting out of bed in the morning is just awful. Im 22 years old and i wanna live. Its got to the point where i feel trapped in a box and im never getting out. I havent had a clear, happy, carefree mind in too long now.
I also know how selfish this whole issue is making me. I think everything is about me. Everyones problems i feel are linked to me. Im so paranoid.

Now it's just gone wrong.
Not only has a neighbours bin blown over leaving a used sanitary towel just lying in the road as detailed in my other post, but now I have another spike.
My brother, who I don't get on with at all, has had a fall during the night, and was taken to hospital, the police showed up at my parents door to tell them, and he was taken to hospital in an ambulance where my Mum then spent the night with him in a&e.
I'm supposed to be going to visit my parents today, but now don't want to as I don't want to be in the house where my Mum has obviously sat, walked etc after being in a&e (think of all the blood there)

"Well,yesterday was an especially triggering day.The number of the date 26 is my bad number.The worst ocd spikes happen on that date number.
Actually i came to my old house and everything went wrong. Driving the long distance to it i fell on many ocd spikes.The list is huge for a single day to refer them in this topic and it's not necessary since i managed to refuse to almost all the rituals ocd had to propose me.Even when using the laundry its door opened a bit and the rinsings started filling the floor of the bathroom,i didn't execute a ritual.
However when i went to fix my bed i noticed on the blanket something moving. It was three moths one big dark brown connected with a smaller white and another small white moving on them.It seemed as if they had group sex,something extremely triggering for my ocd.Searching the net for these insects i found this connection back to back could also be ecdysis (the one(white) gets out of its own skin(brown) like snake) but then what means the presence of the other white? Maybe one entomologist could give the answer.I know it looks like reassurance.....
Nevertheless it bothers me more because on this bed i had my first time on.....you know what i mean.....Anyway even if until then i didn't execute a ritual i gave in and got off the blanket and washed my hands after shooting away the insects with a handkerchief.
I didnt have a shower (as i would on my early ocd stages) and i managed to sleep to this bed even if i got cold without the blanket.
Didn't post immediately to see how will turn my feelings.Yesterday i was in big distress while today i feel better but i'm in discomfort too.
A bit confused as it'd be a kind of relief knowing it was ecdysis it'd be important for the picture i had shaped for this room On the other side looking for it maybe fuels this condition.","['Rituals', 'bathroom', 'OCD']",['spike'],"['bathroom', 'Rituals', 'spike', 'OCD']",1.0,1.0,,,

"Hello,
I have recently developed a severe OCD and rumination combination over anything I can find to stop myself being happy. It's almost a self destruct mechanism, I have fought it hard with some success but at great mental effort causing exhaustion. So I have been reading up and now realise that it's the thought of the thought occurring that's my issue and the actual perceived relevance of the thought which is rediculous. I am now working hard to do nothing not to find a mental solution but try accept the thoughts as insignificant. But this is a hard trait to learn. Things that bounce into my head to stop enjoyment I confront religiously and sometimes I actually forget to think the thought. I have previously used mertazapine to try to sleep which did actually seem to help with the OCD but it actually kept me awake and alert so I stopped using it. Sleep is an issue as sometimes the thoughts are so prevalent its impossible to sleep without something. Some literature actually suggests spiking the thoughts and deliberately invoking them to desensitise the brain.

"Hi All,
my OCD has been ok for a while now,until I found out I have a serious illness,which has brought back my OCD with full force,due to the stress of having the illness.I have got the OCD back under a bit of control now (I even started to wash my hands and had loads of disturbing thoughts).But the latest thing is that the OCD is like causing me to think that some thing bad is going to happen to my mum and I caused it by not doing a ritual.I have stopped washing my hands plus other small rituals,but I cannot get this thought about my mum out of my head.I decided to face my OCD full on.cause life was getting really bad (I was unable to buy things,pay bills etc).I am using the four steps.I am really scared then something bad is going to happen to my mum and that I caused it.I know this is my OCD talking and that I should just walk around the thought.It wants me to do a ritual but I am fed up of my OCD and living like this.I cannot take anymore of this pain.So I am not doing any more rituals.Its really hard to get through the day and to think what is going to happen next week.And that something bad is going to happen to my mum.Do not know what else to say.

"Sorry guys, I need to put this out there and try and relieve some pressure of myself. You'll have read plenty like this before.
I'm plagued by the distrust of myself and the constant ruminations of terrible things that I may have done. I catastrophise the littlest thing so that it feels like all my hopes and dreams for happiness in the future are compromised.
My biggest fear is that I've cheated on my partner or committed a terrible act. These predominantly centre around having been out for a pint with my pals and worrying that alcohol has made me forget something huge.
I should point out that I'm not referring to extreme drunkeness and memory less when i refer to alcohol. I don't drink to excess so as not to be faced by these issues. Unfortunately, OCD now makes me believe that if I have a sniff of a pint and can't remember every second of a day or evening then I'm at risk.
I know the answer is CBT and I've written to a number of practioners today to request a consultation. I've already had success from CBT sessions in the past.
I don't want re-assurance that 'I haven't done anything' guys, but I'd love to interact with you on here if you suffer with the same form of obsessive thinking and rumination as this. I feel isolated at the moment, with my friends and family unable to make sense of my intense worries.
I fear panic attacks and reclusiveness returning as it once did. I did so much to beat this off - CBT and meds, reduction to stopping of CBT and eventually meds and a relatively good life for the past 12 months. The thought of this all unwinding again is chronic.
Please get in touch if you can,
Thank you

hope all is well, i havnt been here for a while.
All has been good over the last week, my partner was here for a week and we had an amazing time.
Had a few spikes but dealt with them
Only problem is, is that he mentioned that i have put on a few pounds in weight. He didnt mean it nastily and said i looked great. But this stuck in my head. When he went i was thinking about it alot and was seeing things about being overweight leads to diabetes. And then my old fear cameback (2 people in my family have it)
I have self tested before and got a result each time of 4. My mum said i should test out of curiostiy if i was worried and the result cameback as 5.2 then 5.0 few hours later
I know this is in the safe bracket but i am positive that i have it and cant shake it. It always seems to be worse when i am alone.

I am throwing everything I have learnt at it but It’s so difficult because it’s telling me I’m just making excuses and deep down I know I am a P. It’s doing it’s very best to make me fall – I’ve just eaten tea with my partner who is the loveliest man I have ever met and I’m thinking you need to know I am a P. He knows what is going on and is extremely supportive, I feel like he would be better with someone else.
I’ve said to myself I am a P and the anxiety is there but I can’t seem to distract, I then need to start working it all out and thinking over old thoughts and groinal responses etc. to check but I know that won’t help in the long run and it’s not helping now.

"Hi guys, 
Been a long long time since I used this forum, mainly due to finally after years of pain and mental torture, being able to see the wood for the trees with OCD. 
(Drum Roll) 
  However.. I had a spike recently which has managed to worm its way into my thinking. I have suffered with OCD for over 20 years and it's mainly been around the topic of harming others.. I always have the constant mind chatter about innocent actions I'm performing being simultaneously to bring harm to others. So the other day I used oven cleaner to clean the oven, one of those highly toxic sodium peroxide based products with warnings over the tin - I didn't wear gloves or goggles and just got on with it without a care in the world, I used a sponge to clean the stuff off which i left in the sink. Obviously during this process, the constant nagging is in the back of my mind that traces of the stuff have come into contact with tea towels etc but I carried on without performing any over cautious measures to """"""""make safe"""""""" the environment 
A day or so later, my house mate did something that incensed me to the point where I felt super stressed and angry and whilst I was cleaning up dishes, I purposely used the sponge or tea towel that had come into contact with the oven cleaner to clean / dry the plates whilst thinking that I did want to poison my flatmate and that I wanted her to die as result.. now obviously in the moment, I was 100% angry and in my mind I was acting to cause harm, and agreeing with the usual """"""""i'm doing this to harm.."""""""" thought processes, so much so that I purposely used the contaminated cloth but then... I just carried on with my night. 
  Now a week later I'm riddled with guilt that it was """"""""attempted murder"""""""" blah blah however I'm trying to rationalise the situation in order to accept it as ridiculous. 
so I'm thinking: 
No evidence that the toxic substance was still on the cloth that I used
No evidence that she would have been harmed as a result of my actions
No expectation that real harm would come to her, as I wasn't expecting any outcome from my actions.. 
  just wondering if this is something to be worked up about as I'm out of touch with OCD  coping strategies

The last day or two has been rough though. 
Cant seem to get out of the rut and I feel like it's falling on top of me again. 
With the one burning question (s) - 
Does testing yourself in ocd happen and can it leave you feeling as though in that moment you were able to take a risk or get close to acting out your fear? 
I keep going back to one point in my rumination and worry, a point where I found myself testing a second time weather I could speak under a breath, I found myself mouthing and freaked out a little because I heard the slightest sound. 
I'm fed up of it coming back to make me feel guilty. 
I don't remember why or choosing to do it, I just remember it happening and at the time thinking woah what am I doing. 
Whatever was happening at the time it didn't spike me up and I was able to work out that nothing had happened, but now it's like """"""""are you sure? What if you did something"""""""" 
I am fed up with false memory and just feeling so much doubt and guilt. 
Please can anyone help me out, can you feel like you need to test your fear? 
I read about someone picking up a knife to see if they would harm themself and then without thinking they brought the knife up towards themself and freaked out once they realised what they were doing. 
I feel like that's what I did, I realised I was mouthing again (my fear is to say something under my breath that I don't want to say to god) 
I feel like I found myself mouthing and panicked when I realised it was happening, like they did with the movements with a knife.

"Hi everyone. I have been having a terrible time lately with my OCD thoughts and have also got to the point where I struggle to see the sense in keeping going at times. I spend so much of my time beleiving the thoughts and it is only rarely (when I get on here) that I can begin to albeit marginally see and understand that maybe this is OCD and not me! I hate myself for these thoughts and I am scared of them. I feel I am a terrible person for having them and dont deserve to be alive for it.
My OCD is all about the devil and how I choose the devil over Jesus. The thing I dont understand is sometimes this is more than just a thought it is also a feeling........and then a belief! I try to fight them at times with rituals but it just ends up making it so much more worse and I end up losing the battle. I have so much go wrong in my life and I am scared that it is the devil doing it to me. I think it is the devil making these things happen and that is because of the thoughts that I have about the devil. It is such a big part of my life now that I feel i am in to deep to get out of this. That it has all become so complex and complicated that I feel there is no way out of this. I am almost 40 and have nothing! I just wish life would change for me and good / great things would happen to me.
I also am continually exhausted. Does anyone else feel like this? All I want to do at times is sleep which i guess is part of the depression.

I just wanted to start off by saying, thank-you all so much for reading and replying to my topic last night. It means so much to know that I am not alone and that I can talk to people that are going through the same things as me. You know, I used to feel so weird and embarrassed talking about OCD now I know it's so common, it kind of helps. Thank-you all again.
How is everyone today? I hope people are feeling better and I just wish that this forum had more coverage because it is so helpful! :original:
Anyway, the point of my topic is to tell you that I am starting to 'get rid' (sorry, couldn't think of anything better) of my OCD's. I have spoken to my mum about it and she has been really helpful in telling me that by me doing (or not doing) these rituals, nothing is going to happen. I am always worrying that if I don't do them, harm will come to her or someone else that I love. Does anyone else have this? Anyway, she has told me that it won't... I still worry but I am trying to stop.
Just asking if anyone else is struggling and whether after time, they do go away?
I know this is a silly question but has anyone ever had a thought (ie. that your family member would be in harm) and then they didn't do the ritual and the thought came true? I worry so much...

"I need help. So far this week everything has gone from slowly becoming calmer and in control again to chaotic OCD hell.
Last week whilst I was getting ready for school I had the thought that the kitchen cupboard door was dirty and I'd get ill because of the germs but managed to ignore it and put it to one side but then a bit later I suddenly thought 'You're just ignoring it because you want to keep the germs on you so that when you see your girlfriend she'll touch your hands and get the germs then die'. I couldn't stand it and went crazy washing my hands and opening all doors, turning taps etc with tissue in my hand so I wouldn't get dirty. I couldn't cope with just that though because I knew I had touched my clothes and all sorts of other stuff before I cleaned my hands so I had to get rid of the germs another way. In the end I managed to transfer them all to this spare button thing I had in my room (the first thing I could get hold of) by touching the button to all the things I had touched eleven times so that they were clean but the button had collected all the germs. (Oh god even I can see how ridiculous that sounds) I then had to put it in a resealable plastic bag and put it in my pocket so that I would be able to keep an eye on it and make sure no one accidentally touched it.
I was then fine until the afternoon when I was looking for something in my pocket and got the button out and my girlfriend then ended up picking it up before I could stop her. And yeah at first I managed to get over it when she didn't automatically drop dead. But recently she’s been getting really ill and has had really bad headaches and a temperature and just generally feeling not very well. I can't stand talking to her because I'm always thinking about how she's dying and it’s all my fault and she doesn't even know it and how I should tell her so that she can make the most of her last few days and stuff. I just feel so guilty and sad and angry and I haven't been able to concentrate on anything else at all this week.
But I can't keep going like this I'm obsessing over everything and analysing everything my girlfriend says to make sure she hasn't got anymore symptoms and I've syarted going crazy even when she says stuff like I love you. I can’t help thinking """"""""How dare you even think about saying it back to her?! She’s dying and it’s all your fault!"""""""" then I decide not to say it and I'll think """"""""It’s her last few days alive! They should be full of love and happiness and you can't even tell her you love her and now she’s going to waste her time worrying about whether or not you love her"""""""". And it just keeps going on and on and on and won't stop!

"Hey guys
I just wanted to say I hope you don't get fed up of me coming and going. Sometimes I go through phases of not wanting to speak to anyone, then I realise the importance of having people you can talk to.
I feel incredibly lonely and isolated with my OCD at the moment. I started a new job not long ago. At first they were dissapointed in me cos when I told them I had OCD in the interview, they thought I would be writing lists all the time, and in control of everything right down to the last detail, and were upset when I wasn't. Anyway, I informed them that that sort of action wasn't positive and they did more research into OCD. But I feel like my OCD has become a bigger deal than I wanted it to.
Anyway, my OCD is pretty bad at the moment. I can't help but think about when I was undiagnosed and how awful I was to people, through no fault of my own. This has turned into endless rumination, and it is making me think people must really hate me and never be able to forgive me. It is making me hate myself and I am currently seeing the staff counsellor in the hope that I can learn to forgive myself.

"My ocd has blown up so bad the last days and by depression is slowly sneaking up on me. Maybe I just have to accept the fact that I need to be sad? i NEED TO GO THROUGH THE DEPRESSION?

My story is the same old. Yesterday I met a guy friend and we hugged.
When I got home my ocd blew up and I really dont remember now if it was cheeck against cheeck, or did I purposley put my head a certain way for his lips to come near my lips? I remember the situasion but details are all blurry. I told my BF I dont remember what I did and how unsure I am about everything.

My boyfriend replied saying """"""""If you dont remember than you have nothing to worry about""""""""


SPIKE!!!!!!

MY ocd replied telling me, """"""""now Emma you can go out and cheat. Kiss a guy you think is hot and the same thing will happend like before. Your ocd will spike and details wil be blurry. Than you tell your boyfriend and he says dont worry if you cant remember anything.""""""""

Im TERRIFIED to be around any guy, as I am scared I will kiss or do something, knowing I can get away with it because my ocd will spike and than make things blurry and hard to remember. Then my boyfriend will just say...if u cant remember then dont worry about it.

Haveing ocd is real tough. day today liveing is a nightmare its torture its pain , its misery, yet we survive dont we if we do it in secret and we do all the silly rituals the traits the times we stop and think what the filp am i doing what an earth do i look like i am sweating like a runner and all over putting things back in a drawer neat. easy for some, for us a rollercoaster ride of emotions!! GOT TO GET IT RIGHT, NEARLEY, THERE.OH ****** IT!!! the day today frustrations.

Unwanted thoughts oh dear here we go the biggie lets watch where we step ...........actually who cares what ever is on your mind visualise it then try and make it fade to dust you can you can you know !!
i have been trying the four steps and do you know what is good about it?? the fact that its all ocd well thats what they say and i take comfort in that .......say it its all ocd .its not you at all you are a pretty little boy or girl its just you have reached a point where an uninvited guest has brought you to the wrong party and you are forced to dance with the ugly fella :crybaby:
yep the four steps are working for me actually there are 5 steps but they banned my suggestion of a booze up at the end.
well so whats the point of this post then chris ..er kirk?........well
its just to meet people on a level so they read and identify and say hey thats me !!! well job done hope you sleep better at night. also its to say when you fight ocd and you feel the hurt this means well done you have made the step !!!

"I'm at the end of therapy with one session left in a months time and I've basically overcome my OCD, with only a few small rituals remaining that don't really bug me too much.
But now was soon as i seem to have managed to get my life back it's started to attack me from a different angle, relationship OCD is not something that has ever really bothered me before but now all of a sudden its really attacking me. I've been with my boyfriend for just over a month and a half now and its just gradually got worse, me wondering whether he's getting sick of me, wondering whether what i feel is completely real even though I know that I really do love him etc etc.
I try and rationalise, telling myself that I do love him and the fact that he tells me he loves me too means that he does, but its the 'what ifs' that are making it so difficult.
I'm going round and round in circles and im so scared of losing him, just no idea how to tackle this.

Doing my best to keep it in control. But... it seems so much that some coincidences were like a sign from God that a certain thing that I am afraid of is true...
Does any one else have this? Do we ever get to rest? I have lost the way I believed in God. I am afraid of the idea of God... I am afraid of any religion to be honest.

"Recently started the Exposure part of CBT, 
For months ive been fine, barely even noticing the intrusions and just letting them sit lke background noise which is a huge step! i could finally see light at the end of the tunnel, i felt ready to tackle the last hurdle, i told my therapist if i could overcome this particular theme like i had the others then i would be set for life because the latest theme has been by far the hardest to deal with. 
Our first session of ERP we had to read out an article about the passing of Robin Williams over and over, yes it was upsetting because i felt so bad for him and his family. but it hadnt triggered me, or so i thought. 
this week she said she didnt know if id actually reached a point that id overcome the intrusions and worry already and she was unsure of which way to proceed because i have been so proactive in understanding ocd and recovery that all that was needed was a relapse prevention plan OR to be more hard hitting with the exposure work, she suggested maybe watching 13 reasons why. Now on first thought this had me worried and hesitant, then to seeing some videos on suicide shared on facebook and BOOM i got triggered i think. feel horribly tearful all weekend, to feeling helpless / hopeless to sleeping 14hrs straight because i couldnt face the day, to the old habit of ruminating if it was all ocd playing tricks on me
on putting laundry away came across a box of sharps on top of  cuboard that id forgotten about to the intrusions of they could be used so that spiked my anxiety, to taking my medication and seeing the box thinking it would be so easy to take them all which futher increased the uneasy feeling to thoughts of how awful my kid future would be without me in it.  just feel like ive taken a huge step backards and got stuck in the whole ruminating wether its ocd or not :'( 
so tired of it all really. i wanna live my life and have things i want to accomplish but not if  have to keep fighting like this. ive ended up back in other ocd support groups, posting in here and sat wondering if im dispaying or feeling things that are associated with someone who has ego syntonic suicidal thoughts or if what im feeling or thinking is ego dystonic urgh so ready to overcome this","['hope', 'anxiety', 'anxiety', 'Medication', 'Suicidal', 'OCD', 'Suicidal thoughts', 'Thought']","['intrusion', 'spike', 'theme']","['intrusion', 'Suicidal thoughts', 'anxiety', 'hope', 'OCD', 'Thought', 'spike', 'theme', 'Medication', 'Suicidal']",1.0,,,,
"Hi all,
I would just like to apoligise for the many spelling mistakes that you will find but laugh away...i don't mind. The reason i came on here is bacase i suffered really bad OCD a while ago and now im 99% cured and wanted to give people an insite on how i did it. I did register on this site a while ago but i read too many bloggs about how people will have to live with OCD for the rest of their lives and i really couldn't see myself having OCD forever.... so i stopped reading OCD blogs..... until today when im on here to write my own and to say it is very possible to get rid of your OCD.
I won't tell you why i got OCD as it is some what personal, but the rusult was verry bad..... i stayed in my bedroom for 8 months constantly, i wouldnt touch anything or anyone due to contamination.... i didn't want to touch the mail as someone else touched it.... i didnt want to sit anywhere in the house as everyone else sat on the same places... id wash my clothes and make sure the clothes didnt touch anything except me when wearing them. i would wash my hands before and after going to the toilet, eating, slepping.... i ended up getting lots of cracks on my hands from washing them too much. The list goes on and on.... and i honestly thought how can i do all these ritualls for the rest of my life??? I need a change fast... so i decided to do CBT though i would have to carry out the CBT myself with no help.... I was finding it very hard at first, then i decided to chage my tacktic after someone gave me a present.
I was given a book called THE SECRET, after reading it.... i bought the DVD.... and in a nut shell...its about positive thinking. Then after i started reading books by Donald Trump, and books about having NO FEAR... called THE 50TH LAW.... i then understood how the sucessfull people all think alike and have the same thought.... ie the positive thinking, really believing in what you want from life...and going out and getting it..... i started to train my self to think like they did....and it worked.... it took 6 months but now.... i can eat with my hands when i go to restraunts, i can shake peoples hands, i can touch door handles, i stopped washing my hands so much, now they are back to normal.... i feel no anxiety at all, and my dreams are comming true one by one.... ive started my own business, ive been going out to bars....its brilliant.
So, what i suggest 1st to anyone with OCD....is dont give up.... it can end for you.... you just have to be positive and train yourself to be strong and motivated. Look for a dream you want, and go for it.... start small...and slowly take it further the next day, and even further the next day. But most important... don't ever be negative in anything you say or do..... be positive and happy, no matter what.... read Positive thinking books, they really tought me how to be strong and deal with my fears in life. Everything is in your mind...and YOU are in control of your mind. Practice controlling your thoughts, and if its a bad thought, stop the thought and do something to distract that thought like watching a comedy film.
There is a lot more to my story but id be here all day typing.... im already getting hungry.... i think ill go out and eat kfc with my hands... love that kfc.","['bedroom', 'toilet', 'washing hands', 'anxiety', 'anxiety', 'fear', 'Thought', 'OCD', 'site']",[],"['anxiety', 'washing hands', 'site', 'bedroom', 'fear', 'Thought', 'toilet', 'OCD']",,1.0,,,

"Hi, I don't discuss my bad thoughts with anyone and only recently after watching a documentary and then read more realised it was OCD, before that i would never have thought that was OCD, as its not talked about openly, its more about putting things in order or germs that i knew about before coming on here, so I felt incredible alone and that I was really disturbed. I would wish for a brain tumour as then the bad part of my brain could be cut out and this would stop. Horrible thoughts have had a real impact on me and relationships throughout my life, only now at 28 do I know what it is, always afraid to go to the doctors in case they locked me up or thought I was sick, now I know it's not that. I've approached the subject with my boyfriend, but he's shrugged it off and I don't know how to tell him I really need help as this is affecting me too much. I wondered why it's spiked up so much recently and I read somewhere that change can be a trigger and I've recently moved in with him and started a PGCE course, I have so much doubt I can do this course and that I'm not good enough as a photographer to teach it (and heariing how good and seeing the images of people around me is compounded this in my head and struggling as I'm dyslexic), which is rendering me useless as I physically don't want to do anything, just disappear as i can't keep feeling like this, it's too hard and lonely.
I want to tell my boyfriend so he can understand why I am the way I am and help if possible, but it's so hard to physically say the words, I lose the ability to speak and I love him so much and never met someone who is so perfect for me, but i don't want to lose him because of this and I don't know if he can deal with me being like I truly am. He's currently out biking with friends for the day, as I sit here with tears streaming down my face and I'm glad he's out as all last night I barely spoke (I'm always talking) and slept on the couch as I don't want to feel like this and be around anyone. It's his birthday weekend and I feel so horrible as I'm ruining it, but I don't know how to stop and get my energy back and do things.
It's not just the thoughts that consume me, it's also I need to do things in a certain way sometimes and for instance when I've set something up for myself and someone without asking just takes over without any regard for me I get so frustrated, it can be something so simple but when it happens I can't concentrate on anything else. When I use to miss the bus I would go insane in my head, I'm fine with that now, but if a make a mistake which someone else immediately picks up on, I feel so stupid and I obsess on why I didn't see it and call myself useless and stupid and feel really bad for quite awhile, being dyslexic with this doesn't help! I've learnt to except some mistakes I make, like missing the bus, but not of a lot of others, it's like I've got to except each and every mistake instead of mistakes as a whole. If I feel I've said something wrong or someone has got hurt by what I've said (never intentionally hurt someones feelings) I get so worried about it and how I'm going to face them again.
I look for reassurance especially from loved ones, but people usually just give platitudes and then I feel stupid for asking and that I really am the way I think I am, which makes me shrink more into myself and not talk. I don't want to burden anyone with any of this and in the past when I had depression people walked away from me, as they didn't know how to deal with me and so I was left on my own. It wasn't for them to deal with just to hold my hand and let me know I wasn't alone, but that didn't happen. This makes me so afraid to tell my boyfriend now as I don't want him to walk away, he said he's had a nice life and not had anything really bad happen to him or anyone he's close to, he has his issues of course, but he's successful and well liked and generally says he's happy. This makes me so envious as I feel sometimes like a failure in my life and the only good thing is I have him, which isn't good as I need to feel I'm good because of me and no one else, but he makes me be a better person. He gets so uncomfortable when he's out of his comfort zone and worried and backs off, he does like that i get him out of routine and gets him to relax (as I said he does have his issues) sometimes, but when it comes to difficult stuff it's swept under the carpet. Fairness to him I am his first relationship (been together 17 months now) and so he's new at this and what a dive in at the deep end being with me, lol. It took him a year to say I love you and one time he said he doesn't know if I'll ever be happy so it holds him back in the relationship. This made me feel so horrible and still worries me now as if I'm not happy I don't want him to go. The why he didn't say I love you thing, after 6 months didn't bother me so much as he showed it all the time and he's not good at communicating his feelings and he says it a lot now.
I'm grappling with a few things at the moment and when it gets this bad I distract myself and get on with it, that's never really worked, only a quick fix, but I need to get this sorted as I want a good life and to be happy and not just when I'm distracting myself from these feelings. I know I want to be with my boyfriend and I know he wants children in the future, hopefully in the future he'll want them with me, but I need to get to grips with myself and not be scared to have them.
I've only ever said this stuff in my head, hopefully it doesn't just end here.
If anyone did manage to get through this mammoth post, thank you for your time in reading this.

"Hi guys,
Today I made the decision to quite CBT therapy. It wasn't an easy decision and it's taken weeks of consideration, I realise for many of you, you are perhaps waiting for therapy. Whether it's low-intensity or perhaps more intense. I realise you probably think I've given up an opportunity to heal and recover from OCD, but please read on.
To start with, I've felt as though my therapist is not attuned to life. I've seen her every week (compared to most therapists who only see you once a fortnight) and most times she's set me exposures of 3-4 times for that week. The main one has been going to ASDA and looking at knives with my husband, and touching one if I feel like it. Sounds simple enough, right? Now let's break it down. I don't drive, so I depend on a bus. It takes 15 minutes to get from mine to ASDA by bus, buses are never at the stop, so let's say 25 minutes all inclusive. My husband works Monday-Friday 9-5 plus overtime then gets a bus from work for 10 minutes, so let's say he arrives at ASDA nearer to 5:30. I'd then have to meet him, go do therapy (let's add 20 minutes for that), come home (remember 25 minutes) and cook. If you said on average it takes 30 minutes to cook a meal, depending. We're not talking about eating until about 7pm. I don't know about for many of you but most people, including us, like to eat by about 6pm. I'm also expected to do forms and sheets to record my progress, so say two hours a day, that's about 8 hours a week I'm dedicating to therapy. Plus an hour to and from the centre and an hour in therapy on a Friday, that's 11 hours. I've also got to eat and sleep, exercise, clean the home, walk the dog, spend time with my husband..and RELAX! I know it doesn't sound like a lot, but it's surprising how much housework could get done with those 11 hours!
I was also told that I have to not worry about other peoples problems last week. Well, my Dad is disabled, my father-in-law has early onset dementia, my best mate is currently in Scotland for a family bereavement and asked me to look after her house, sure, so that one is a choice I made, but my wedding would have fallen apart without her, it's a fair trade, really!
And what about all the other little things? Like people laughing at me in the street because I'm a larger lady? I'm supposed to not listen to my music and ignore them. What about me? What about how I'd internalise those insults? How about if I listen to my music, I won't actually hear them to start with?! And STRESS. Oh my god, ever noticed that little gem? I was bitten by a dog this week, how do you think that's made me feel? Upset? In pain? Shaken? Yep. Felt like doing some therapy? Uhhh...nope! But she still expects me to!
The actual therapy place itself, for a start, is an old office building that has been hired out on a whim to save it from demolition, There are pictures hung on the wall which in no shape or form match or tie into any theme. There is no TV, radio, not even a magazine to read while you wait! The therapists are never on time, and the treatment rooms themselves are slathered in magnolia paint with a coffee table, two chairs and a bedside lamp. Chunky pipes run from corner to corner in the ceiling which grunt and gurgle through therapy. Hardly very relaxing, after all!
As for communication, well, there have been a few times I've had to call in for various reasons, once I had the flu, once I had a major panic attack and called to ask if I could have my session over the phone (which I was told she could do if I had a problem). Most of the time there was nobody at reception so I'd leave a voicemail thinking somebody would call me back, guess what? Nobody picks up the bloody message. I get a call saying that my therapist wondered what was going on because I hadn't attended therapy and it was a strike against me if I did not attend without communicating, I had to call 48 hours ahead (again, who knows 48 hours ahead if they're going to have flu or a panic attack?!).and when I do, still the message sits on the machine and goes nowhere! She also gave me a number to call which was supposed to be her own...guess what? It doesn't bloody work!! Oh...add to all this, the one time she DOES get my message, it was about my Mum not being able to attend my therapy (no idea what that was about, by the way) she says she thought I said my Mum could attend therapy, but I could not, and that I have a very bad phone line. Isn't it amazing how many other people can hear me as clear as a bell?!
Well, last time was the final straw. She looked me up and down and said that diet and exercise would help my OCD. I have genetic lymphodema. I can eat every superstore out of apples and carrots and greens and still not lose any weight. It's not what I eat, it's not what I do (ok, some maybe, but we all have a little something now and then!) it's the fact that because of the lymphodema, I'm a bit bigger than I should be for how much I do and how much junk I eat. It's not my fault and she's there to deal with my head, not my BMI! I know that minerals and vitamins can help mental health and I know sleep and exercise can improve things, I don't eat takeaway or microwave meals and I do stay reasonably active. Maybe it's just me, but I thought it was quite unprofessional of her to play dietician!
So that's my story...needless to say, from now on I will be depending on the support of people who aren't professionally trained!
Rant over folks...I just had to get my experience off of my chest!

"I hope you are all battling this awful condition today and beating it!!!
I've had an awful day today because of this horrible condition. I have been very stressed, agitated and tearful.
Luckily I have the most wonderful Girlfriend who supports me.
All I've done, all day is to keep saying sorry (for having OCD) and how much I wish I could just flick a switch and be rid of it for good.
I know that can't happen, and I know how silly it is to think like that as I know I am lettling the bully get one over on me today.
I am usually very strong and I fight off inrtusive thoughts every minute of every day (by fighting them off, I mean I allow them to be there and don't get upset or anxious by them) it's just that today I just couldn't fight them off. I sat and sobbed and my Girlfriend comforted me. I also seeked out and received reassurance. Sorry everyone, I'm usually so strong offering advice to everyone on here, although admittedly, I don't come on the forum so much now as I find I do ok from day to day. I know I should still visit the forum to offer you all help and support wherever I can.
My spike or anxiety attack today was the usual, thinking I could be accused of doing something I hadn't done. You can all imagine where the thoughts lead to. It beat me today, my SUDS (subjective units of distress) are lowering now, as the major upsetment was earlier in the afternoon, but i still feel very sorry that I gave in today. I must have apologied to my Girlfriend two dozen times today for having OCD. She understands my condition but I do feel that sometimes she must be pretty fed up of it when i have """"""""off days""""""""
I don't really need to expand on my particular strain of OCD, I'm sure you can all understand. I think I covered it in more detail in one of my first posts when I joined the forum.
So there you are, a pretty awful day really, I just felt that I needed to come on here and try to reduce my anxiety by posting.

"Thought I would give a little update about me. Some here have gotten to know me pretty well.
I struggle with alot of different themes with OCD. Even my therapist says I change themes pretty fast. But I have had ROCD for a good while, 4 months and it got so bad I started prozac again without really talking to my therapist about it. I feel much better in the sense of being able to go on with my day with out the attacks, I just have the thoughts.
My OCD seems bored with ROCD and changed over to POCD, which I felt was dealt and managed a year ago, but now it's back and harder than ever.
Ignore your thoughts? I know, I know.
But I can't stop the feeling of feeling like a bad person. I mean I get groinal responses because of OCD and still I go on with my day with my newphews and do not care about the """"""""nice little feelings"""""""" I get. I let them sit on me, I let them cuddle me, I let them cuddle and snuggle with me no matter what of the groinals....AND this makes me feel like an awful person.
Who in the world would let kids sit on them, cuddle them, change their nappies when they know they will get groinals? I feel like a monster.
Thank you OCD for another round of OCD.","['talking', 'Thought', 'OCD']",['theme'],"['Thought', 'talking', 'theme', 'OCD']",1.0,,,,
"I have had some unpleasant experiences over the years, due to confiding in people, but if everyone was like Jane, what a very different world this would be. I just wanted to share this story with you.
I was on-line looking up some details of an author. I noticed a book, I was very interested in, for sale on e-bay. I don't normally buy things on e-bay, because of my very extreme contamination fears. The book is out of print and the copy was 20 years old. That in itself posed a problem, but as I don't even view new books as clean any more, and those I do read, I read in the garden, I decided to place a bid for it. When I received notification that my bid was the highest, I panicked, because I noticed the seller stressed that she used recycled packaging. To me that meant the packaging had possibly been on someone's door mat. One of my most feared areas! I wrote to the seller, a lady called Jane. I said I had OCD and contamination fears and could she use new packaging if I paid extra for it. This is Jane's reply:
Hello Tricia,
Cheque arrived this morning - thank you.
I have been unable to get """"""""New"""""""" cardboard, that I normally use to protect books. So I am hoping a new large padded """"""""Jiffy Bag"""""""" will be OK with extra bubble wrap from a new roll.
I shall open the Jiffy bag after washing hands using Alcohol gel cleanser. I shall wipe dust cover with antiseptic wipes and leave to dry, before putting it in bag.
I cannot think of any way to sterilise book pages though.
If it helps you to know about my household - I have to be exceptionally aware of germs - due to heavy medication - I have no immune system and have to avoid as much possibility of germs from other people. I spend most of my life on antibiotics, although this is always chest infections that """"""""Get"""""""" me.
Consequently my house is a bit on the weird side medically and no-one is allowed in without stringent precautions.
Sorry to make this email so long, but just wanted to tell you that I understand.
Regards Jane
I hadn't even requested that she clean the book, I merely asked if she could use new packaging!
My daughter wondered what was wrong with me, the morning I read Jane's e-mail. I stood by the computer (I can't sit down) and I couldn't hold back a few tears.
The people who have had the most empathy for my condition have always had quite severe physical problems. This wonderful lady, who doesn't even know me, went to all this trouble for me.
The book arrived yesterday, the packaging so clean and the book so carefully wrapped.
I stood in the garden reading the first chapter and a strong smell of antiseptic wafted from it!
God bless you, Jane.
Love,
Trish.","['interest', 'OCD', 'washing hands', 'Medication', 'email', 'fear']",[],"['washing hands', 'interest', 'email', 'fear', 'Medication', 'OCD']",,1.0,,,
"Hi, don't know if any of you saw coronation st tonight. Just a comment from the character Janice Battersby on OCD.
I suppose it's like her character to say it but I don't see why the script writers had to put it in there in this way.
- It was, aparantly regarding the recent death of one of the polish women who worked in the factory, I only saw the comment. My dad said it was that they were meant to have washed their hands of putting the case to rest if you will.
She said, """"""""I think I got that OCD. I keep washin me hands""""""""
Now one it doesn't really relate to the 'washing of the hands' :dry: - har har.
and it doesn't help the stereotypical view of people with OCD. It again reinforces that view, and while the handwashing can be a part of OCD, I don't see why they had to put it in that way..

"Hi
I was wondering how many of you think that jealousy can be worsened by OCD. I do no end of rituals and when I had the harming others thoughts I used to get really jealous of even the slightest thing, which encouraged more harming others thoughts such as someone being friendly with another person more than me etc? I am not as bad as I used to be but can still get bouts of unwanted jealousy over things such as relationships. That can really get me down at times.
How does jealousy affect your OCD?

"Hi there.
Now, in short.
Acute leukemia over two years ago, heavy treatment no real chances of survival, bone marrow transplant with all the funny package, miracle of some sort and Im still here. Of course with heavy OCD (bacteria everywhere, washing hands, safe zones, fear of people being disease carriers, different sets of clothes for different things. Learned to live with all this.) Been treated by our shrink teams, with very little success.
Been employed all that time, being off sick, then working for over a year as a IT tech/driver. Recent changes in the company (including new, less forgiving boss) led to making my position redundant (among others, not health related). Previous boss helped me with job organisation, new one didnt even want to hear about it.
Now. Got redudnancy pay, that may keep me going for few months. Tried to find some jobs, but it's very hard to find something that would keep me far from locked tight enviroments (like warehouse/office buildings), tried to be honest and mentioned my health history - always same answer: Okay, we'll call you as soon as something comes up.
Contacted job centre. Due to still weak immunity system cant take all the jobs. Open spaces/not crowded areas are recommended by doctors. In that case I'm not really entitled to JSA benefit as I cant take all the jobs they may offer. I'm not entitled to ESA either, as I'm capable of doing some types of works, as this is kinda partial disability. OCD is never treated seriously by people who never experienced it - more like manner of lazy individuals. Job center reffered me to some sort of disability assistant, which have never contacted me. Tried various organisations (incl. McMillan) and non of them is capable of providing any assistance in matter of finding jobs with condition like that. I wanna work, I'm skilled hardware IT tech, experienced dirver, done a lot of various jobs in my life... just really dont know where to go now, and whom to ask for help.
Maybe some of you been through similar thing, I'd gladly use some advice

"Hey gang,
First things first. I think I'm beating back my OCD again - I guess it's because I have more things to do now. I have my grades back so am not worried anymore and I'm looking forward to uni, where I can hopefully wipe the slate clean.
I keep beating myself up for some ruminations because I keep wondering if I want to be worried and depressed. I don't want to be - it's just it's become all I know on occasions when I've been feeling really down. I don't have to stay worried and unhappy because it's not right - I have a right to a good life, I just haven't been very kind to myself this summer, emotionally beating myself up repeatedly.
I just wonder sometimes if I'm to blame for my own problem. I feel that God's not angry with me and it's just the OCD kicking off. But it's like a constant circle - me worrying about worrying because I wonder if that means I want something to be wrong so that I might have something to worry about to fill my head up. It's complex but difficult and I think all it means is that I'm used to worrying too much and need to loosen up. Like my brain can't get by without worrying. Every time I try to stop the emotions feel like they want to burst out like a big bottle of champagne and it makes me want to cry.
I think I think too much and that sometimes my train of thought goes off-course and falls down where I can't reach it. I really ought to take it easy before I go off to uni otherwise I'll get stressed out.","['hope', 'Thought', 'fall', 'OCD']",['rumination'],"['rumination', 'OCD', 'fall', 'Thought', 'hope']",1.0,,,,

"Since I was a child, I've had this fear of spiders. This is normal, right? Most girls I've ever met have been afraid of spiders. Only recently, I've started to go a bit overboard. There was one in the room, and even now, a week later, I get really stressed sitting here in case it crawls near me. When I go to bed at night, I get images of it crawling on me and have this very irrational, but very real fear that it is going to crawl into my ear.
I've always suffered from arachnophobia, but this seems worse. My question is, is it OCD related? Fueled by OCD? I had a really bad spike lately, and the night the spider crawled up the wall I literally sat in the chair in a ball for two hours, too terrified to move, even crying once when I got myself into a state about what kind of spider it was. I've never been like this before about them, not to this degree. Which I suppose answers my own question, but...

"Been a little while since I was last here. I got a new job which I love and look forward to, I actually don't like it when I'm given a day off. My ocd was getting better, it was like I was gaining some control over my life and it felt easier to walk away. I stopped my hand-washing ritual, but my cpn was worried that I was compensating for it by doing another one more so. I've cut down on the other one but the hand washing one is creeping in.
Maybe its hormones but today has been strange. Earlier I was so happy, as I generally have been recently. This morning I was in a bad mood, and now I'm upset. I feel like I'm trapped in my mind and its scaring me so much. I've been kidding myself and my cpn, sometimes I don't think I have the strength to fight because I'm so scared of what will happen. People around me are assuming I'm getting better and I don't seem able to tell them the truth.
My mom has mentioned her worry that I'll become obsessed with exercise, I tell her I won't. If I don't exercise I feel so guilty, my brain tells me I'll put the weight back on and so I end up doing it. But today a couple of hours after I'd finished, I realised I hadn't done one of the exercises, I told the person I was on the phone to that I had to go. I did it quickly in jeans, and then my brain said it had to be in my workout clothes, so I got changed, and I went through the routine of things like folding the clothes a certain way. I phoned my friend back, but my mind was preccupied, and while on the phone I did it another 8 times. I felt like I had to. For the first time that I've noticed, my brain said if I didn't do it then something would or would not happen. I had to get out of my bedroom and away from it.
I can't escape to daydreaming because things have to be done a certain way in that too, I repeat scenes in my head. At work if I look at someone or something I have to do this little thing of looking back and forth. I can't get away from it, I do it all day. Its like my movements have become rituals, and I'm so terrified of having an effect on specific things. My ocd has targeted something that I've always wanted and is telling me that if I don't do the ritual then it won't happen. I'm still not confident enough to take the risk.
I'm so scared that I'm getting worse and I haven't told anyone because they're under the illusion that I'm ok. None of my family understand.
Sorry I just had to get that out, I don't see my cpn until May and I'm having a bad day with it. I hope everyone else is doing good and fighting the ocd hard,

"I have just been diagnosed by an nhs Principal Psychologist as having moderate to severe ocd(it's severe!!!!!) I was open about my 2 themes, despite being worried about the risk assessment element. 
  Anyway, I self referred and had an initial assessment over the phone with a psychiatric nurse way back in March when my ocd returned with a vengeance. I was barely able to take that call as I am currently so debilitated by my ocd. I neglected to tell the nurse on the phone that I had ocd, and he neglected to ask, so I was referred to the Primary Mental Health Team, which I was told today could only offer me 6 sessions, which the psychologist said would be insufficient, considering the severity of my ocd. Today, the psychologist told me that I should have been referred to the Community Mental Health Team, so she will have to write to them and it will take a few weeks. I neglected to ask her if that will involve me being placed on another waiting list. In the interim, I am being offered NO sessions.
  The psychologist also told me today that she can't guarantee that the Community Mental Health Team will take my case on, and if not, she will have to review my situation.
  I had waited 5 months for today's appointment, during which time I have been unable to function due to the horrors of my mind.
  I feel badly let down by the nhs.
  However, at this moment(reassurance, I know), I do feel slightly better, as I now have an official diagnosis, but like any form of reassurance, I wonder how long the feeling slightly better will last, considering how reassurance is usually short-lived.

"In a false feeling of security, I came off Clomipramine about three months ago. I had been on it on and off since the age of 25 (I am 40 now). Then I had a massive spike just before Christmas, spiralled and have been deteriorating fast until now.
I phoned the GP tonight in a state, realising that everything was imploding around me. She rang me for a phone appointment - it's not a GP I've had before, but apparently she has a special interest in mental health issues including OCD. I thought she'd put me back on the Clomipramine, but she said she wanted to put me on something faster acting and prescribed me Olanzapine (probably didn't help that I was in a state of high anxiety when we spoke - approaching panic attack)
I've had a look at the medication lists on both the OCD UK and OCD Action websites, and it is not mentioned - I'm wondering why she has prescribed this instead of an SSRI or the Clomipramine. I have another phone appointment scheduled on Wednesday to discuss how I'm doing.
Not sure that I'm that confident that she's prescribed the right thing. She told me it works very well with people who have OCD. Wondering if anyone has any thoughts?

I've had this fear of developing schizophrenia or phycosis since I was diagnosed 6 years ago. When I was being assessed they were asking me questions like do you hear voices? Are you getting messages from the TV...etc..this got me thinking am I hearing voices..am I getting messages from the TV..and so I began to obsess over developing something like that. So I read a few books about post natal depression and was triggered by lots of things about psychosis and if I read anything about schizophrenia it also set me off..I read about command hallucinations and ever since it has been my biggest problem. I get the word kill in my head and think oh god I'm having a command hallucination. My ocd started off with a theme of harm based around my children in the form of images. It then kind of morphed into words and getting the word murder or kill would set my anxiety right off. I would get terms like just do it going round in my head. I was so scared that my mind could be telling me to do these horrible things but all along I knew the thoughts were a product of my own anxiety based on fear of developing these illnesses. Anyway I practice mindfulness now and I'm doing quite well but I just still really struggle with this. Last night I couldn't sleep and lay thinking..what is actually stopping me from acting out on these thoughts. Just thinking that had me sweating and feeling so nauseaus.

"I have contamination fear in order to understand I have to label my theme of ocd even though I know its all the same. I am pretty much house bound except for going out for a daily walk which is needed for some exercise as well to push through so I don't become completely hiding in my house. This morning instead of taking the safer route that I prefer I decided to take a route where there is more chance to come in to danger, I was in a good mood this morning and thought I could handle it. As I walked I began to rule out routes home, cant go this way because I have to walk under an overpass and might get road grime dripping on me, cant go that way cause that isolated overpass might have had drug users hanging out last night, cant go the way I came because there was a dumpster parked that might have hazardous waste in it so I picked the last way home and as I am walking I see a discarded condom on the ground. I stop and think but this time I running out of ways to get home and decide I have to face my fears and stop letting ocd push me all over town so I walk a wide circle around it feeling that should be good enough but as I kept walking I start to worry that the rain had spread the contamination out wider than I anticipated then I think my shoes are contaminated then I think the bottom of my pants might have been and I should have taken a wider area soon the only way I would have felt safe is with a 6 block radius had been established. I started to panic and my head was spinning I didn't know what to do I was still a ways from home and when I did get home I had no idea how I was going to get in the house without spreading the contamination further.
long story but I am home its been about an hour and a half and I feel a somewhat better but I am still feeling short of breath like I had run a marathon.
The point I am wondering is how do I continue facing this world? I live in a big city so there will be lots of things that are yucky out there and I have to be alright with it but I don't know how I can be ok with this world.

"Hi all,
I just need to get this out of a my system I'm not looking for reassurance which used to be my every reason for posting on ocd bulletin board but just to get whats going on out of my head and maybe get some clarity from typing it out.
I have been battling with ocd for the past 12 years and I'm finding it increasingly difficult to get by my daily life with the amount of rituals I have to do.
I get up and have to get out of bed on a certain thought ,
then once up I will go over in my head wether or not I have hurt one of my children in the night while I slept.
once i have thought of these horrible things then I am reassured that I haven't done these things because no memories have come
I will then get dressed but only into certain clothes , no under-ware or socks are aloud.
because of this my feet sweat and cut and people can smell them it's so embarrassing.
I will then go in the garden and try and do some weights in the hope that this will burn off some of the nervous energy... hoping that my ocd will edge off. These exercises will take twice as long because of stopping and starting doing rituals.
Then I will get in the car and go out to my girlfriends mums house with my girlfriend and are two kids here I will stay till about 2:30 then I will leave for work.
I arrive at work and sit at my pc doing rituals but trying to hide it from colleagues e.g I have to look at certain icons on the computer wihthout having certain thoughts when I look at them, my colleagues can see my head shaking and eyes moving fast but don't say anything.
I then start my shift and will get stuck repeating and clicking on things again and again slowing my work down colleagues will be waiting for the work i am doing adding to the pressure and worsening my o.c.d. this carry's on until 12:00 am when my shift finishes
I get through the shift only just... leaving mistakes in my work and having done half of what I am capable of . I am scared that my colleagues will ask about these mistakes .
I come home watch some tv do some rituals and then go to bed do some rituls and then go to sleep.
I am worried I will loose my job I am the main bread winner and haver to keep the money coming in. as my girlfriend is off work with ptsd after having are second child where she nearly died.
Since last week people have left my work leaving me in charge of the shift I have to manage everything we have clients in singapore and america I have to deel with and I can't do it wiith my o.c.d or hide my o.c.d now because i have added responsibilities.
I ended up in A+E on friday because I was so upset I made it through the whole week with my o.c.d and then had argument with an in-law because they thought I was,nt doing enough for my family they thought that because sometimes I get up and don't say hello to my son or don't say thanks for things or am just generally distant it angers them and they where very mad at me. This made me start crying and I couldn't stop I had to go and get a taxi to A+E sobbing in the taxi like a baby and crying in A+E waiting room for 2 hours it was so embarrassing.
I have now started resisting rituals and am trying to live without ritualizing I hope I can keep it because I feel I can't get through next week doing rituals.
I have a sore tooth Maybe if I get toothache really bad it will take the focus of my o.c.d that would be good.
I'm sorry to be so negative I know o.c.d can be managed I have been in a place before after cbt where I was just agreeing with o.c.d when it came up and not getting worked up about It I was doing exposure and living my life without doing any rituals .
I should have kept it up but the pressures of modern life made it hard to matian an exposure programme.
I hope I can stick with this new approach I hope i can be with the pain and letting it naturally end without stepping in with temporally releif..The rain before the rainbow...

"Hello all,
First of all, allow me to send out my love and support to you. I really mean that.
I just needed to post again. Having another spike - same old OCD junk blah blah blah. I just hate it and it exhausts me. I can't even be bothered to write it down anymore. If you're interested please refer to my previous posts.
I know it will pass (it's important I write that down even though, despite all evidence to the contrary, at times like these I get fears that it won't pass), as it has always passed before. But I mjst post in an effort to externalise these fears.

"I'm having a very bad day. OCD is being a total at the moment and I can't handle it anymore.
I had my friend stay over last night, and everything was fine. OCD was a pain in the bum, but I got through it, tried to ignore it as much as I could. She knows I have OCD and she knows what I'm like, but I just think in the back of my mind that she doesn't like me and that she thinks I'm some kind of freak. I always have to ask for re-assurance from her, everyone really. I try my hardest not to do rituals around people, but it's hard-ish. [if that made sense] It makes it alot easier to resist doing them when I have someone to keep me occupied on something else. I usually do a before bed ritual, kinda like a prayer, and I didn't do it. So now I'm thinking to myself that I have to do it twice tonight. And I've done this for a while now, and it's like a routine. I just want it to go, but it re-assures me about everything.
But back to today, my friend didn't realise what she did but She sat on my duvet, and I automatically thought, shes got different germs, smells all that stuff and I want to change my duvet right away, it didnt feel right. So I told her I don't like people on my duvet anymore, she got off it and I really wanted to change my cover, it was all well.. germed up. I waited a little while and then changed it. I put my duvet in my mums room because I know my friend wouldn't go in there. It was well... safe. I don't mind my mum or the people that live with me to touch my things, but sometimes I get abit funny with them. Anyone else, its not right, I don't like it.
Another thing that happened was my friend had her feet up on the table and her foot touched my new mug. And when I got this mug, I didn't want it to be washed , because the water would have other things put in it and so germs from other things would be in the water and therefore on the washcloth. But I made it really obvious that it was OCD, because I picked up the mug and went straight to the kitchen to wash it. And then I wanted to cry because I didn't want that to happen. I had to wash out the sink, and then get a new washcloth and then fill the sink with boiling hot water, and then washed the mug for a good 5-10 minutes, then I had to put the mug on a bit of kitchen towel and leave it there. I now feel better, but I went to my mums room and burst into tears saying that I didn't want to have OCD anymore. Im having a really hard time with it at the moment, I just want it gone. But some good news, I had a letter come through and I start therapy again at the end of this month, I'm really happy about that. But I'm abit worried too because Ive been to therapy before and it didn't help me, so if it doensn't what do I do next? Go on medication? Would it be good to go on medication while Im having therapy?
And, I don't know, but could I have contamination OCD?
I'm sorry, Ive just rambled on and on. But I needed to vent.

"I am just curious about this. People who have OCD themes as a child. Sexual ones. How is it that children can have sexual OCD without anything sexual happening to them how do they get sexual ideations in their heads without them being through something. To me that is like saying I learned to drive a car at 8 without anyone teaching me. Or I learned to bake a cake, granted there are bright children but they are not born to know these things. Now when I was little I replayed events over and over again that were not necessarily abusive many if not all people would agree that children experiment. Why is it that I replayed my experiencess over and over again in a highly anxious state.

"Hi,
I am off work sick as my contamination OCD is out of control. I have spent all day, every day during this time of absence reading about my OCD as I've learned that knowledge is power to beat this evil bully that I have had with me for 40 years! I don't know what adult life is like without it!
As I'm not well at all, my doctor has prescribed Sertralin - I've never taken any medication for OCD before. I'm so reluctant to take it. I'm not depressed and can at times feel happy although the anxiety my OCD is causing me is crippling and I'm rarely leaving the house. Obviously, my OCD bully is telling me not to take the medication because if it works, I'll not do all of my obsessive cleaning rituals and myself and my family will get really ill and my elderly parents will die - all my fault.
I start CBT tomorrow with NHS (on Phone) but has anyone got any advice about Sertraline? I like a glass or two of wine in the evening as it helps me switch off but will I really need to stop this? I only went to my doctors a few weeks ago about OCD as I'd never mentioned to them before but work could see I was not well and said I needed help.

"Hi all,
As you can see i'm new to this forum.
I have just had a psychriatric assesment positive for OCD and I have some questions to ask.
I was surprised at the diagnosis, esspecially after looking at much of the information that is posted on the internet pertaining to OCD.
Behaviours like repretitive hand washing to the point where my skin is flaking etc is not experienced by me. I do think about cleanliness quite often but not in such a severe case as I see on the internet. My problem lies more in excessive perfectionism. I can't enjoy activities because I see them as mechanical or ritualistic, but they range across the board and are not extreamely specific (washing hands, germs etc) that seems to be more like my conception of what OCD is. I am extreamely self-concious of how I act and behave in public and am extreamely concious of how my parter behaves too. I wont stop working of projects until I get it 100% perfect and will take no breaks and as a result produce things very very slowly. It takes ages for me to do the simplest things. Has anyone experienced these kinds of things, because the internet gives the impression that OCD is very black and white and mainly focuses on cleaning rituals.
Thanks!","['surprise', 'joy', 'washing hands', 'Rituals', 'OCD']",['excessive'],"['surprise', 'washing hands', 'Rituals', 'joy', 'excessive', 'OCD']",,1.0,,,
"This is what works for me in response to a spike. Engaging with spike in any way like accepting possibilities, applying logic etc just make me stuck in OCD loop. Is it because my OCD is bad at the moment and later I would be able to accept possibilities etc? That means I should calm me a little for some time and then work on cognitive side. Or it is just ok and I should stick with refusing to engage with the thought at all and refocusing away? Please suggest me.

"I was out today with a few members of my family, having a really nice day at a local fete.
We sat down to eat, and my little baby was grabbing at things on the table, as babys do. I picked up a serviette off the plate, and did as all mums do - wet it (with spit! eugh) a little and went to wipe the babys face. After I wiped him, I turned over the tissue and found it to be covered in blood!!!!!!!!!!!! There was blood on the table, and the plate.
Well I had touched it, licked it and slopped it over my cute little defenceless babys face! AARRRGGGHHHH
As you can imagine, within seconds the OCD played out in my head, oh its blood, its certainly got hiv, I licked, touched and touched my baby with it - we all have hiv now and are a danger to my other child, and my sister has taken the baby off me and the blood is on her - now she has hiv.................... and so on and so forth - I can't begin to tell you how spiked I was.
Well to cut a long story shorter my sister noticed (I was too far gone!) my sister saw that my baby had cut his hand! (or bit it - he is just getting teeth) and the blood was from him, he had been batting things around the table, and got blood on a few things - and it was all quite innocent.
BUT the stupid stupid stupid ocd got to me first. - lesson learned, deep breath don't bite - now ocd is telling me there could have been something on the table which got to my baby - am trying not to engage, its been a long hard day!","['anger', 'OCD']",['spike'],"['anger', 'spike', 'OCD']",1.0,,,,

"That OCD is a bully, that preys on our insecurities and fears and phobias,
That's why it always helps to codify the way our OCD operates - what is the underlying fear underpinning it - e.g. fear our children will be taken into care, fear we will be arrested for a crime OCD tells us we committed (but of course we didn't) , fear we have inappropriate sexual attraction, fear something bad is going to happen to a loved one, fear we will be contaminated and be made ill/make someone else ill.
Building up a picture of what sustains and feeds our OCD is the start of working out a plan to tackle it - weaning ourselves off unhelpful compulsive rituals, exposing ourself to our fears and experiencing anxiety then feeling it fade as we work our way up a graded hierarchy, challenging the OCD by doing the opposite of what it tries to tell us; letting intrusions be without ruminating on them or trying not to think of them or not deliberately passing a neutralising thought through our brain.
It's important to discover the right approach, and those struggling will find plenty of guidance and help here, from the guidelines on the main OCD-Uk website or from self-help books a\vailable form the OVD-UK shop, maybe recommended by the community members.
Whatever your type of OCD or anxiety caused by it, it is most likely that someone here has knowledge of it . so keep calm everyone, take your time, be patient if you have to wait for therapy - and you will hopefully find solace friendship and fellowship here.
Have a lovely weekend

"Had ocd since childhood, I'm now 42 with a loving wife and 2 lovely kids.
I came off meds in December and had a rough time at work. I carried on but started to get worse in Jan and then gave up the gym. In Feb I started to drink more and then started to obsess. Pocd is my thing but lately its been trying to break into under age too.
I then had an operation and have been off for two weeks with another two likely.
I have actively fuelled my ocd with time to burn. I've gone back on meds.
I've been google mad, got bothered about diagnostic material, phallometric testing, ego dynastic or systonic, whether I like things and just use ocd as an excuse and sometimes spike on each word any person uses in a forum post.
I'm freaking today as to whether I'm using ocd after really liking stuff or vice versa. My clear ocd brain knows its all anxiety driven, all of it and thereafter comes whatever.
This is how quick it'll grab you and I just needed to connect with others who know.

"erm hello
i'm feeling really down at the moment. i just wanted to talk to someone who understands this ocd stuff. i tried explaining to my friend and i think ive scared him off, he doesn't get it. i just feel really lonely. i have nothing to do on my days off and yet im miserable at work, which makes me feel ungrateful for what i have. there are all the bad things happening in the news (i can't mention what they are) and i feel responsible for them and i can't do anything that i did before they happened in case that makes them happen again and as i heard about them while i was at work, it now makes me associate them with work so i have to be extra careful when im at work.
i always, without meaning to, notice the number of things, from how many biscuits i eat to how many possible tops i could put on in the morning. and i then, without meaning to, associate the number of things with representing the number of times something bad has happened. the thing that i most fear has happened twice so if i do things three times it would be like they would represent the feared thing happening twice and then a third time, which would be representative of the feared thing happening in the future and so i would worry that this would make it happen. so at work (i work in a clothes shop) i would carry two armfuls of clothes, not three; and if there are two size 10's out and i have to put out another, then i have to put it in between the two, because then it is less like i am adding one in front of the other two which would make it like the feared thing happening twice in the past and then being added to in the future....... this is so hard to explain and i am mentally tying myself in knots trying to make it make sense
i also have thought rituals (wishing for certain bad things not to happen, in a certain pattern, that has to feel right and not be interrupted otherwise i have to start again) that i have to do every day when i wake up, which is making me dread mornings, especially when i have to get up extra early so i can get them done before work.
i'm not really sure why im telling you all this, other than that no one else knows and i have no one else to tell. sorry for the length. if you read it all, pat yourself on the back; if you understood it, wow!

"Okay so when I was first diagnosed with OCD when I was 15 I went through the lot , thinking I was gay, thinking I was a bad person, thoughts and pictures not going from my head as it happened on a horror film etc. 
Now once them stages kinda passed 15 years on I came to a new thing, I could only do things in even numbers so if I walked 3 steps it had to be 4 etc. Now how common is this and is that a rumination or giving in to OCD as I'm trying to write down things in my diary about things I need to work on and finding it hard. I don't want reassurance though as I know that's bad. I haven't had a bath or shower for 6 weeks now and hate water going over my head due to bullies who tried to drown me and I was a inch from my life before someone helped as they kept my head under every time I surfaced. 
I had a bad past and did things I'm not proud of and I get guilty over them a lot and I stop eating and try to concentrate on something else but it's still there and it affects my feelings as I cry and have panic attacks and flashbacks and always on edge when the door goes, thinking People are after me or looking at me etc. I had to drop uni etc as it's getting too much and I stay in most of the time now. Will this ever end. 
I keep having these weird sweats and shaking below my knees and round the back, like little tingles and when my mind goes they go as well. 
I constantly feel spaced out and the thoughts just sourround me and keep getting stronger and even days or weeks later they are still about. I want to sleep all the time and usually have 12 hours plus but can't sleep till about 2 or 3am

"When we have too much time to think, OCD will seek to fill that vacuum. 
We then get sucked into unhelpful rituals and overthinking, trying to analyse and pigeonhole our thoughts into what is and what isn't OCD, reality conundrums and all sorts - all bad mental activity. 
So the simplest, cheapest therapeutic task in the world is this: get, and keep, busy. 
My wife and I, in retirement, are very active, and keep a joint diary, plus activity worksheets week per view. 
We take a siesta in the afternoon, and switch to dinner cooking and relaxation by chatting, TV radio reading music or writing (in my case)  around dinner. 
Generally this keeps us happy and very involved in quality activities, and limits the occasions we could be prone to the illness.

"i recieved this story in a forwarded email the other day. I was feeling quite negative earlier on about my OCD (i suffer prom perfectionist thoughts and excessive doubt about everyday things), but when I read this it made me feel a bit better. It won't take long to read, just a few minutes.
John is the kind of guy you love to hate. He is always in a good mood and always has something positive to say. When someone would ask him how he was doing, he would reply, """"""""If I were any better, I would be twins!""""""""
He was a natural motivator.
If an employee was having a bad day, John was there telling the employee how to look on the positive side of the situation.
Seeing this style really made me curious, so one day I went up and asked him, """"""""I don't get it!
You can't be a positive person all of the time. How do you do it?""""""""
He replied, """"""""Each morning I wake up and say to myself, you have two choices today. You can choose to be in a good mood or ... you can choose to be in a bad mood.
I choose to be in a good mood.""""""""
Each time something bad happens, I can choose to be a victim or...I can choose to learn from it. I choose to learn from it.
Every time someone comes to me complaining, I can choose to accept their complaining or... I can point out the positive side of life. I choose the positive side of life.
""""""""Yeah, right, it's not that easy,"""""""" I protested.
""""""""Yes, it is,"""""""" he said. """"""""Life is all about choices. When you cut away all the junk, every situation is a choice. You choose how you react to situations. You choose how people affect your mood.
You choose to be in a good mood or bad mood. The bottom line: It's your choice how you live your life.""""""""
I reflected on what he said. Soon hereafter, I left the Tower Industry to start my own business. We lost touch, but I often thought about him when I made a choice about life instead of reacting to it.
Several years later, I heard that he was involved in a serious accident, falling some 60 feet from a communications tower.
After 18 hours of surgery and weeks of intensive care, he was released from the hospital with rods placed in his back.
I saw him about six months after the accident.
When I asked him how he was, he replied, """"""""If I were any better, I'd be twins...Wanna see my scars?""""""""
I declined to see his wounds, but I did ask him what had gone through his mind as the accident took place.
""""""""The first thing that went through my mind was the well-being of my soon-to-be born daughter,"""""""" he replied. """"""""Then, as I lay on the ground, I remembered that I had two choices: I could choose to live or...I could choose to die. I chose to live.""""""""
""""""""Weren't you scared? Did you lose consciousness?"""""""" I asked.
He continued, """"""""..the paramedics were great.
They kept telling me I was going to be fine. But when they wheeled me into the ER and I saw the expressions on the faces of the doctors and nurses, I got really scared. In their eyes, I read 'he's a dead man'. I knew I needed to take action.""""""""
""""""""What did you do?"""""""" I asked.
""""""""Well, there was a big burly nurse shouting questions at me,"""""""" said John. """"""""She asked if I was allergic to anything. 'Yes, I replied.' The doctors and nurses stopped working as they waited for my reply. I took a deep breath and yelled, 'Gravity'.""""""""
Over their laughter, I told them, """"""""I am choosing to live. Operate on me as if I am alive, not dead.""""""""
He lived, thanks to the skill of his doctors, but also because of his amazing attitude... I learned from him that every day we have the choice to live fully.
Attitude, after all, is everything.
Therefore do not worry about tomorrow, for tomorrow will worry about itself. Each day has enough trouble of its own."""""""" Matthew 6:34.
After all today is the tomorrow you worried about yesterday.
after reading this, i thought, """"""""the way i respond to my ocd will affect the kind of day i have. If i wake up and myself be consumed by my ocd, my day will most likely be negative. but if i apply a positive attitude to the bad thoughts, and use my behavioural techniques as much as possible, things might not be so bad. and if this doesn't work, i can always try again tomorrow.
with ocd, we need to get on with things and have a positive outlook on each new day that we've been given. everyone has problems, ocd is the one we've been dealt. but look at people in 3rd world countries with no clean water, no good food, no good house. they must feel like giving up too.
so instead of letting our ocd consume us, lets try our hardest to fight positively against it. even if we still feel rubbish, at least we've made an effort.

"To provide some context. I have always been an obsessive thinker and have not helped myself with excessive drinking of alcohol. Currently I am in a long-term relationship, and live with, my girlfriend. She is the best thing that has ever happened to me after a life of messy and toxic relationships.
A few months ago, I was leaving my job and at my leaving party. I was drinking way too much, and got into that mode of feeling out of control. As I was leaving the final pub I ended up alone for a former colleague and for some reason decided it was ok to say I had always fancied her. The details of the rest of the night are very fuzzy in my head but we ended up at a bus stop kissing for a while and then I was on a bus going back to her place. At some point even in the state I was in, I knew it was was wrong and I got off the bus and got a taxi home.
The next morning, I had to wake up and get to the airport as I was flying to LA for my new role. I felt terrible but didn't want to say anything because I was going away for a week, I didn't want to leave her with that news. I spent a whole weekend by myself and became overwhelmed with guilt. I spoke to friends, family and a therapist and the majority said I should not tell her and move on. The main reason being there was a very slim chance she would find out as she doesn't know anyone from that side of my life. I felt I was getting there but then a few weeks ago the former colleague messaged me on LinkedIn, it was all nonsense and sent in the early hours of morning, nothing suggestive but it sent me spiralling. 
What I would like to clearly say is I know I have done wrong and I am not asking for sympathy in that regard, I also know I need to control my drinking and I am being proactive in that regard. My challenge is that I cannot decide on whether to give into my urges and tell my girlfriend, or keep it to myself and learn to accept it and move on.  No matter how I try (using techniques from therapist) its pretty much all I debate in my head. Its the first thing that I think about when I wake up and the last thing I think about before going to sleep. When I watch stuff with her and I hear the words """"""""Cheating"""""""" """"""""Trust"""""""" etc. I automatically launch into the classic beat myself up approach. I know if I tell her its going to really hurt her and she may not ever trust me again, or worse, break up with me, it could be very selfish to pass on my guilt to her as a coping mechanism. Another aspect to this is whether its always about respecting her by telling the truth.
I would really appreciate some advice and guidance, I know its not an easy one and there is not a right or wrong approach, but I can feel myself getting more stressed and depressed by the day.

"Hopefully I can ask this here.
I am just hoping for some advice on what to do (or what a therapist might advise) if you have a complete lack of sex drive. Some of my OCD themes are indirectly tied into a sexual nature I suppose, so that is also maybe exacerbating the issue. It's not just a lack of drive, but almost more of a fear and something that causes great anxiety to even think about. I just don't want to do it. It's not just that I don't have a sex drive. I don't want one, either.
I guess I am wondering whether a therapist might advise just doing what you fear as somewhat of an ERP therapy? However, this doesn't quite sit right with me in this particular context.

"Hello
Ladies.....
Does anyone notice an increase in OCD symptoms when they're a few days off their monthly thing...? :-)
I've been monitoring it...and find OCD symptoms increase around that time. Not massively....but I find OCD gives me a few niggles.
I spoke to GP a few months ago who said the spikes and drops in hormones might have something to do with it. She recommended a hormonal pill that I could take to regulate the hormones.
I'm not sure I like the idea of taking something like that....has anyone found anything that works? :-)
At the moment, I try watch what I eat around that time and increase exercise which does put up a good fight against the nigglies.
Be interested to hear what others might do to manage these spikes and other experiences :-)

"Hello everybody. It seems like I view and observe myself from the outside a lot. Time to time it's like I'm monitoring my actions and evaluating them and analyzing them. It scares me and I get this feeling like things are too real or something. Then I start wondering what we are as humans and I start thinking about energy and how my energy affects others visa versa.
In the past I've taken an interest in such things and thought that they were interesting, but it feels like such a struggle to think about that type of stuff all the time. Because instead of just having a conversation or working or doing something I enjoy, I'm thinking about what it means and why I'm there and why it's happening. This may also be due to being a pretty artistic person, but what's the point of being artistic and creative if your thoughts and actions only make you anxious.
But back to viewing myself from the outside, I find it hard to say what I mean or just have fun or do things without hovering over myself and having some sort of excessive control over myself. I'm sure that some of these things may be positive for self-improvement and evaluation but isn't it a little obsessive to think about everything all the time.
Also, I've been attempting to explore my true feelings and emotions which is a scary place, but I find it easier to think too much about that too and never really know when the right time is. Then I wonder if perhaps I don't have as many problems as I think and that I'm just making them up because I'm not occupied with and absorbed in other things.

"Lately I've been dealing with my OCD pretty well over the past few weeks but there's something that sent me back into a worry. I overheard someone at my school say that anybody who thinks homosexuality is wrong, is a homosexual themselves and hasn't come out of the closet yet. Now at first I dismissed that comment as an arrogant, hateful remark, but since I've been struggling with HOCD, I started to spike. I started to once again get that pain in my head when I get anxious and then while I was anxious I started to worry that because I got anxious in the first place that I was in denial. It was very frighting to me because OCD can cause you to have """"""""feelings"""""""" and thoughts that seem real and I got scared. Now I don't know how some people will feel after they read this, but I am a Christian and I honestly think that homosexuality is wrong. But to have someone say that anyone who thinks the way that I think is merely a closeted homosexual is just sad.

"Sorry for this long post.
I have hocd but there is one issue that makes me completely doubt it. For my whole life I have wanted to be with a man and get married. I am extremly romantic in my thoughts and my wishes, yet have never truely been in love. I have one ex-bf who I loved for his intelligence and kindness but was never physically attracted to him. I was 18 when I started to see him and I was never interested in the physical sides of things. I also had a huge sense of religious guilt about the sexual side and so I could never really enjoy it. At the same time I felt too young for intimacy and despite being on the pill I felt extreme panic that I would get pregnant.
At 22, I am no longer religious or carry the burden of that guilt but I guess you could say I am extremely spiritual and still have high morals. Just as a note I have gay friends and am totally open with that.
I would assume that I have a low libido but when I occassionaly do get an urge it is always for a man. At the same time I find that I am not that physically attracted to many 'real' guys. I also don't get to meet many - aside from the club setting (which I don't particularly enjoy as I feel like it's a competition to attract a guy). This all leads me to question and obsess over my sexuality and I get the usual ocd cycles and rituals.
The one thing that still makes me doubt whether it actually is ocd is the fact that I unwantingly get aroused when I see 2 women kissing etc on tv and it is more than just an ocd groinal response. I don't get aroused like this watching 2 straight people being intimate. I also occassionally have gay dreams and they are usually more intense than the straight ones. I wake up feeling fear and guilt as I don't want them. I don't get an urge to watch lesbians on tv but when I do stumble across something I can't help but feel aroused. I can't even admit this to my therapist.
I don't want to be gay or bi but does this mean I am?
I can't imagine being in a relationship with a female and I am never attracted in that way to any actual woman but I am terrified that in the future I'll end up falling in love with one.
All I want is to have a boyfriend and I now feel like I'm ready to be physically intimate but I am struggling to cope with the ocd.
Is this even ocd or am I in denial? When I accept that I am bi, it still doesn't feel right and I still can't stop obsessing.","['Thought', 'interest', 'Rituals', 'fear', 'fall', 'joy', 'urge', 'guilt', 'OCD']",[],"['urge', 'interest', 'fall', 'fear', 'Thought', 'Rituals', 'joy', 'OCD', 'guilt']",,1.0,,,

"Wow, I've never started a topic thread here before...hope I don't screw it up.
I was diagnosed with OCD about a year ago. I've had plenty of predictable triggers, like a news story about rape triggering fears that I'm a violent predator. But I've also had some plain nutty ones that absolutely spiked my worst fears, but in retrospect seemed so far-fetched (even to me!) that I just had to laugh at myself. These moments were kind of therapeutic, cause they reminded me of what a mind-twister OCD can be, and that I truly have OCD. I started writing some of these down, cause laughing at the thoughts seemed to take away a bit of their power.
Here are some of the triggers that initially scared me to death, but later made me laugh hysterically. Anyone else experience this kind of thing?? Feel free to add some of yours
1) When I was reading Lord of the Rings, the description Bilbo (a 55-year-old man) managed to freak me out that I'm a pedophile. Don't ask how I made THAT connection, I couldn't even tell you. But it made perfect sense at the time.
2) I spend - literally - an entire afternoon reading online psychoanalyses of a fictional Freddie Krueger (probably written by 14-year-olds who have time for such things), trying to see if I had any similarities that would confirm my fear that I'm a psycho killer. I mean, Freddie Krueger personality profiles? Not only is he fictional, he's supernatural. It was like comparing myself to spiderman.
3) My friend's cat triggered me into fearing I'm gay. No, seriously. I was thinking about how cute the cat was. The cat was female, and it suddenly occurred to me that I thought it was cute because it was channeling some kind of female voodoo vibes. Hence I was gay.","['hope', 'writing', 'Thought', 'OCD', 'fear']",['spike'],"['OCD', 'fear', 'writing', 'Thought', 'spike', 'hope']",1.0,,,,
"So I used to come on here quite a bit and it's been a long time since I've been on, i noticed a lot of people do that on OCD forums, and I think we all maybe do it for the same reasons? We feel like reading these posts sometimes are maybe too much, or you won't find anyone to relate to what you are saying, etc etc and so rather than go through the painful and exhausting process we avoid it? Atleast that's what my problem is! but after several long months I'm here hoping someone can relate. I have harm based ocd, where i worry i will hurt people etc, before that I had problems with thinking people would spike my drinks or food with drugs and before that I had major problems with vommiting based illnesses. I was diagnosed with OCD almost two years ago, and it was because my thoughts went from fear of drugs to fear i might hurt someone, which made me so scared and so upset I had to see someone about it! It turned out that I've had ocd since I was a little kid, and it never made sense to me then. I always thought i was just scared of getting sick and overly cautious, but after seeing my doctors and psychiatrists and having them explain what ocd is, I can totally see how badly my ocd behavioirs were! Dealing with this for years, I fully understand now how OCD waxes and wanes, so now my ocd circulates around karma and religion and the law of attraction, but no hope of losing the violent images I look back on how silly it was to worry about things like drugs and if i had to choose, I'd go back to that! but unfortunately with ocd, it doesn't seem to matter, anything your ocd decides to maginify, silly or scary, is all horrible and hard to deal with in the end. Anyways, my problem now, is that I worry about my actions or decisions having consequences, or I worry if what I'm doing is good karma etc. In terms of religion, and magical thinking, I for instance will be watching tv and want to go to a channel but then right before I click on it, my mind CONVINCES me that if I do, it will have something to do with religion, but the bad side of religion (i really don't feel comfortable enough to type specifically what im talking about, but it's the opposite of god) and what is freaking me out is that sometimes it is about something like that, whether it's mentioned on the show or there's pictures of bad religious things, or the number of the volume or channel adds up to a bad number (i forgot to mnention ive been stressed about numbers lately!) so this makes it hard for me to feel like i have any chance of being ok! even writing this is hard! This is the most difficult for me because i feel like everything i do or say is going to have religious or magical consequences! like the people who reply to this will have a bad number in their name or a name that means something bad etc. I feel like im trapped in this depressed and ****** world and it's hard to escape! The other thing is something i will think of a show or movie and then sometime in the week or month it shows up on tv, my sister said that this happens to her all the time (she's not ocd) and it's just the law of attraction (which i dont believe in and no one else in here should) which freaks me out! but i tell myself that theres no such thing and that it's stupid because if the law of attraction existed then every ocd suffering person in the world would be in trouble! but it's difficult to feel like you're safe when you worry about religious magical things and then things happen that make you think bad things are really happening, please tell me im not the only one going through this!!","['Food', 'hope', 'talking', 'site', 'writing', 'Thought', 'fear', 'OCD', 'process']",['spike'],"['talking', 'process', 'OCD', 'site', 'fear', 'writing', 'Thought', 'spike', 'Food', 'hope']",1.0,,,,

"Hi my names Lisa, I have been a sufferer of OCD since childhood. Several years ago my washing rituals were so severe that I had to spend 3 hours each morning getting ready for work. I used to start work at 2pm but only just get there on time, often without full make-up (which I used to apply as soon as I could after starting work). I used to get through a whole bar of soap a day. Basically a few years ago I started treatment by going on Prozac and attending therapy with an OCD specialist in London. My rituals improved 75% but I never made the 100% recovery I was hoping for. I am secretive about this illness as the few people who know about it think it is very serious indeed and think less of me I'm sure. I am still much better than I used to be but my rituals have worsened a bit since the treatment ended. Under stress I am worse and if someone talks to me whilst I am washing my hands and I lose concentration or if I drop the bar of soap then I have to start all over again.
I have just seen the Aviator on DVD tonight and seeing that made me look to see if there was a forum out there for like minded people. I could understand the scene in the bathroom where having just washed his hands, Howard wondered how he could open the bathroom door without contaminating his hands again. That is so me.

"Guys I thought of a different attitude to our problem....I am personally overwhelmed by my OCD but I don't know if my idea here, can be of any use for us...
What if we decide, that from now on we work for our intrusive thought?
Here is what I suggest in detail....
We all struggle to set goals, dreams, harmonic relationships, and it seems that always, our OCD comes into our way and destroys everything in the process. In other words OCD is an ego-dystonic disorder. The thoughts are always against our Ego (goals, dreams, needs, etc)...
So I mean lets try to bring our Ego closer to our OCD and make a deal....So that all of our actions deal directly with our Ego which in return is going to indirectly satisfy all of our OCD needs.
IN other words, from now on We work directly only for our Ego and Indirectly for our OCD.... Meaning that we will never Directly act upon it and perform the rituals. That's it, we perform for our Ego but indirectly our Intrusive OCD thoughts benefit too....
Here is a list of some examples of how our Intrusive OCD Thoughts indirecly benefit from a stronger Ego
Example 1.
Intrusive OCD Thought.
Your OCD insists on Reordering Furniture in your House/Bedroom etc...While you try to do your Job or Socialise etc.
The need to socialise and setting of goals is part of our Ego... So we deal....
List of indirect OCD benefits when we directly act upon Ego...
A stronger Healthy Ego can justify the best order idea for me.
A stronger Healthy Ego can earn the money in order to replace some of my old furniture
A stronger Healthy Ego can attract potential buyers in your life so you sell the Junk furniture,
A stronger Healthy Ego can find the way of how to deal with that delema. Your OCD NOT.....
any OCD worry you have is seriously taken care by a stronger Ego
Example 2.
Intrusive OCD Thought.
Your OCD wants to distruct you from focusing on your exams....He Asks for extensive house cleaning....
You can not focus. You feel like you get an Attention Deficit Disorder
But your exams is a part of a goal which is a part of your Ego...So you deal....
List of indirect OCD benefits when we directly act upon Ego.
A stronger Healthy Ego can motivate me to effortlessly maintain a simple, tidy. clean household
A stronger Healthy Ego can help me financially get stronger so I can buy all betst detergents and a Hover for my carpets...
A stronger Healthy Ego can make my friends give me sincere friendly feedback on cleaning
any OCD worry you have is seriously taken care by a stronger Ego
Etc guys...
So from """"""""Ego Dystonic"""""""" we move towards an """"""""Ego Syntonic"""""""" behaviour.....
Just this,,,Before I feel down again...

"Hi -
I am suddenly really really panicking - sorry for posting so much but I've been having a difficult couple of days.
About an hour ago I posted about some marks on my chin which I think are due to picking at my skin when I'm stressed. However, I (stupidly) looked it up and to cut a long story short I'm pretty sure I have leukemia.
I mean - I have basically all the symptoms. But the symptoms are unfortunately also related to anxiety (excessive sweating, feeling tired/weak, aching bones).
What do I do?
I have had problems with aching legs (which I think is anxiety related) for ages - does this mean it could be leukemia or not? Maybe if I have had it for so long I would know by now.......how long does cancer last before I would know for sure that I had it?? Plus I have been feeling so lethargic and feverish and shaky lately, which I thought was anxiety, but what if it's not? I honestly don't know if I can deal with this. :/
Urgh sorry I just need reassurance. Usually I would ask my mum but she's in Poland right now and won't be back until tonight.

"Hi there,
I've been diagnosed with severe ocd since September but have probably had it all my life and as a result truely believe I am a messed up person who needs to be fixed. I have constant rumination as if I am trying to solve the problem of why I think the way I do - exhausting and an extremely unnecessary way to spend my life - but sure I can't seem to break the cycle.
I'm in the process of doing an anxiety programme but am confident in the fact that I will benefit moreso from individual CBT which starts in the New Year.
Anyway, the reason for my post is that I am on a dosage of 20mg Lexapro and I feel that it's not working for OCD and depression.
The OCD has really affected me this weekend - moreso because of that awful shooting in the school in America last week. I have been feeling really down and aggitated again and can't avoid the constant rumination in my head and am so worried that I cannot cope with OCD and will eventually crack up.
I need advice around going back to my doctor regarding the meds. Should I go to see if I am on the right medication or if I should change it. The psychiatrist on the course advised that it wasn't the best idea to change meds when on the anxiety programme, but I feel that the lexapro is having no affect whatsoever and I know am depressed and exhausted at this stage.
However, if I do go to the doctor, I'm worried that it could be just for reassurance to get rid of OCD thoughts or on the otherhand I could be going for the right reason which is that I think the meds are not working.
Any advice would be great because I do want to work on the OCD in the most effective way. Until I start the individual CBT I feel like I am in limbo and don't really know when I am looking for reassurance or not!!

Just finding life quite hard at the moment . It's so hard living in a house with non-ocd people. I know they're very kind and caring and do put up with a lot of the stuff I do, but sometimes I wish they just cared and understood more about germs.
I've just been sitting around the past couple of days trying to do as little washing/cleaning as possible but it's just resulted in me hardly being able to do anything, like going outside, etc. I've just been feeling really tired as well - even though I haven't done that much!
And then today I went out with my mum and dad on a nice walk, but there was this bit we walked past which was quite narrow and had loads of rubbish on the ground. Then we went to a pub afterwards, we sat outside (I sat on a bin-liner!) and they had stuff to eat, but I've got a big problem with eating out so I just sat there and they kept offering to get me something to eat and I kept refusing and I just feel really bad.
Then when we got home I changed my clothes, but they're just going to sit all over the place. Aaaargh!
Also, the second topic I wanted to talk about was handwashing. I've managed to cut mine down a bit, but the thing is it takes ages for me to wash my hands even just once. I'm not sure if other 'contamination' people do this, but for me it's not just handwashing, it's the thoughts I get while I'm washing my hands - like counting a certain number of times - until it feels 'right.' And then there's this thing I do once I've washed them, I spend a while checking them for any lather or bubbles left on them - and if I see any it means I haven't washed them properly and I have to rinse them again. Eventually, when there aren't any left I usually shake my hands dry because I don't like touching the towels that other people have used. This whole process can take up to 10 minutes and it's very inconveinient especially when I need the loo, as I usually wash my hands before going as well as after .Well, actually it's inconveinient all of the time because it takes so long to do anything.

As soon as I get up in the morning, my rituals kick in. I have to do up my bed in a certain (near perfect) way. Which takes me 30 minutes at least. Then I brush my teeth which takes me 20 minutes. Only then can I get on with other things while still being affected by OCD symptoms.
A few years back I got a brand new motorcycle. But I was so obsessed about keeping it clean that, I eventually just covered it with bike-cover and bought another one. But the same thing happened again. I eventually ended up selling both because I was unable to ride them because it would take me so long to bring them back to clean state and align it so perfectly in the garage, that it was just overwhelming.
The same goes for laptops. I have 5 laptops now. The other 4 are brand new and have been brought to clean and safe condition  if you know what I mean. I don't consider myself a hoarder, I just can't use some of my items, because it is so hard to keep them perfectly clean, that I end up going and getting new ones which I think I will be using without OCD but it never happens. so that is how I end up with 2 bikes, 5 laptops,  and a lot of other things in multiple quantities.
When it comes to social behaving, I'm horrible. I don't like being around small kids, because they carry a lot of sticky stuff that is usually food or other things that they eath on couch or on bed, which I don't like. Because of this, In the entire house, I can only sit on a dedicated chair which I guard and keep clean at all times. This is so horrible. It is like living in hell. I mean, I often think, I'm a grown man, I should know what is going on in my head, but it is useless. You can't resist. You just can't do or think of anything else unless you carry out the rituals.

"Its just over a year since my latest OCD theme emerged and just over three months since I made the connection between it and that I have OCD... or think I do at least.
I initially self-diagnosed and have since been assessed for CBT, now on waiting list after assessor said I seem to be suffering with instrusive thoughts.
The latest spike emerged back in May and has been fairly constant since. As I said, in June made the possible OCD discovery and since then done what I can to self-educate about OCD and follow all the advice I’ve been given/read on here. One of the biggest things Ive done too is to stop confessing/putting my boyfriend in the position of reassurance.
Ive started to feel better, having many more good days than bad recently but all thay is starting to happen is now questioning that I actually do have OCD and that I’ve just latched onto this.
Rational part of my brain can identify themes and spikes since being about eight years old - many of a sexual nature - but I can shake this underlying fear that I have latched onto this and I don’t have OCD and never did.

When I go for cbt with core mental health team a Wednesday. I was telled to make a list of all my ocd rituals. But I don’t really like writing down my ocd rituals because I might after do rituals and tear up the paper and through it away what should I do. I find easy to talk to cbt therapist about my problems than make a list for when I go. They telled me to make the list so i can stop each rituals. if anybody understands what i mean.,"['writing', 'OCD', 'Rituals']",[],"['writing', 'Rituals', 'OCD']",,1.0,,,

"Hello guys.
I hope you don't mind but in order to ensure I don't become a 'new person' I'm going to post my thoughts here on why I would want to do my OCD rituals.
I'm only going to do this for a short period of time as I know it could turn into re-assurance but for the time being I think it would be really beneficial to get some support from others.
Again, please tell me if you think this is in-appropriate!
So today I want to become a new person because:
- I missed the bowl when I went to the loo yesterday and I felt silly, (just being honest, I would have never said this so I'm surprised I'm putting this but I know I can't lie or hide my problems)
- On an iPad game called Bubble Witch I said to my mum as a joke she was the larger witch and she got annoyed and this therefore means I'm mean
- I was a bit snappy for about three minutes tonight because I was hot and I have a pain in my arm
- I've been making mistakes when typing- (putting the wrong letters)
Thanks guys!","['hope', 'Thought', 'OCD', 'Rituals', 'surprise']",[],"['surprise', 'OCD', 'Thought', 'Rituals', 'hope']",,1.0,,,
