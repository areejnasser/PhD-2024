I have had a noticeable increase in checking compulsions, but they don't seem to fit a particular theme. Some are clearly related to contamination (my usual OCD theme) but others don't seem to have a root at all. For example, I find it difficult to leave my office to go home. I check the windows, plug sockets, drawers etc., but it's more of a general unease that's driving it rather than a fear of something in particular.\\nWhen I get home, I find it really difficult to relax and forget about the day. Again, it's a general feeling of unease more than anything. I worry about how I come across to people, whether I'm meeting their expectations, do I really deserve to be in that job? I spend all evening running the days events through my mind to try and find answers to these questions, but of course it just winds me up even further.\\nI have a doctor's appointment on Monday to discuss my OCD symptoms but I'm not even sure what is OCD and what's not any more. Am I just wasting his time too? Everyone gets anxious when they start a new job. Is it just a normal response that I'm experiencing?\\nI've got the week off work next week when my son starts school. My brain is telling me that it'll be do me good to have a break but I really don't want to. I feel compelled to plough on until I feel at ease. It's making me anxious just thinking about taking time off because my brain is so desparately trying to find certainty, when to be honest it probably doesn't exist. It's just a matter of time, waiting until I settle in.\\nI suppose my problem is, I don't know what I'm dealing with. Is this all part of the OCD, does it fit a more GAD-type picture, or is it just a normal response to the stress of starting a new job? I really don't know any more!\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"prefLabel\",\n      \"properties\": {\n
