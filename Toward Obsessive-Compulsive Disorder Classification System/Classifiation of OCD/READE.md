For demo how to use the obsession model downdload 'Use_BioBERT_model_obsession_expert_tested.ipynb' and run from Colab prefereblly (as it require cuda). 

The repository 'Classification of OCD' contain four subrepository. The description of each folder is as follows
############# BERT########################################
The BERT repo has two python scripts used to create Obsession and Compulsion model trained based on the BERT pre trained model.
The link to the model is found here: 
The dataset to train the model is found in the folder named data.

############# BioBERT########################################
The BioBERT repo has two python scripts used to create Obsession and Compulsion model trained based on the BioBERT pre trained model.
The link to the model is found here: 
The dataset to train the model is found in the folder named data. This model use a separate expert reviwed data to test the model which is also found in the folder data.
