"I grew up with obsessive thoughts, or more aptly, intrusive thoughts. I believed they were a reflection of who I am, but recently I have learned the very opposite. They are exactly who I am not. It is not real. There is a dark honesty about the next few paragraphs, but I feel it needs to be told.
My intrusive thoughts (intrusions) have always been violent. From as young as 4, I remember thinking about death. A little older, about killing, rape, murder. Under the age of 10, I would constantly be haunted by thoughts of torturing people around me. Inappropriate acts of violence. And even though I didn’t understand it, acts of sexual violence. These thoughts came in fast and in succession. They become constant, repulsive, extremely distressing. When I was little, I recognised intrusions as bad thoughts. I knew I shouldn’t be having them but I didn’t know how to communicate them to others. They could be so frightening, it almost felt like my own mind was blackmailing me. To make matters worse, obsessive thoughts ugly brother, consequence stepped in. Consequence took my compulsions and mixed them up with my obsessions. It reared its head in the voice that speaks, “If you don’t match all of the spoons up together, your mum will die today”. “If don’t you cross your toes when your legs are crossed, you will crash your car into those school children.” “If you don’t wash your hands 3 times in the 12 step process, your house will be robbed while you are at work”.","['site', 'compulsion', 'obsession', 'rash', 'process', 'Intrusive thoughts', 'Thought']",1,1,1,1,1,1.0,"['rape', 'violent', 'distressing', ‘repulsive','intrusion', 'obsessive thought', 'obsession', 'hand', 'intrusive thought']","['rape', 'violent', 'hand', 'distressing', 'obsessive', 'repulsive', 'site', 'rash', 'thought', 'intrusive thoughts', 'obsession', 'obsessive thought', 'process', 'compulsion', 'intrusion', 'intrusive thought']",1,1

"There is a risk, however small, that tomorrow I will walk under a bus. There is a risk that I may get Ebola (can you guess what my OCD might be especially keen on at the moment?), that I might cause an accident, that I might hurt someone unintentionally, that I might leave my cooker on and burn down the entire student residenceâ¦ the list goes on. Every day we take a million tiny decisions and a million tiny risks.
Worse than all of that though is the risk that I choose not to take. There is also the risk that I donât face up to my OCD and that it ends up consuming my life, my dreams and my future.
You see, life is dangerous. There is scary stuff out there. And yet we have to make that choice â do we accept the uncertain, the unknowns and live with it (as those without OCD seem to do), or do we allow OCD to try to reduce those risks and spiral into isolation and fear, anxiety and terror. You see, in the face of uncertainty, I will (like most humans) leap to the worst possible conclusion. Instead of accepting uncertainty I will do everything I can to strive for the impossible, 100% certainty.
A huge part of facing my OCD has been about accepting uncertainty. I might get Ebola, but I might not, but those extra hours I spend washing my hands are definitely hours that I won’t get back. Because if I live continuously on edge, fearful that something terrible might happen, then Iâm not really living, am I?

"Hey guys
Hope everyone is still fighting the good fight!
I posted a few days ago with some suggestions my therapist had but it was during the bizarre forum deleting time period.
I was saying that I have bad anxiety in the mornings and my therapist made (in my opinion) a pretty valuable point regarding not eating in the morning increasing anxiety. She basically suggested that as humans we are still programmed to run on adrenaline as soon as we wake up in order to hunt and gather food. I never ate breakfast, just a coffee until midday. I'm forcing myself to eat breakfast and id like to report a definite decrease in morning anxiety! I know that caffeine can effect your mood so I'm trying (and failing) to cut down, although I've been looking Into it quite a bit and some studies seem to suggest that consuming high levels of sugar can be detrimental to your mental health. For me personally, when I have too much sugar I get shaky and my mind seems to jump about the place even more. So I'm thinking about trying to eliminate sugar from my diet for a while and seeing if it has any impact on my anxiety. I was wondering, has anyone else found reducing certain food groups/additives etc has improved your overall mood? Don't get me wrong I'm in no way saying cutting out sugar will definitely help, I don't know if it would and that's why I'm asking you guys what you think definitely becoming a believer in the idea that looking after yourself in every way you can can give you that little push in the OCD battle.

"Hello all
Ive just posted a topic on the BDD part as I feel As though I might have that, so I wont talk about my body issue and thoughts on this part.
I'm twenty two with Dyspraxia (dignose at 20) and I have a brother who suffers from Pure O (and is aspergers ) and my dad has OCD (also aspergers) so I have grown up around OCD, but because of my brother who is very serve with his mental illness I have been pushed to the back towards mine and have only recently started to address my problems.
I don't know if I have OCD and please dont be insulted if you think I dont and that i'm making a mole hill out of a ant hill, I have never dare to say or even post before as I have see my brothers torture he goes threw every day.
Lets get into then.When I wake up in the morning my thoughts are just so negative and if I'm honest there always negative. My mind constantly flashes back to a horrible moment in my life and when i snap myself out, my thoughts will run over and over and over this until i feel as it resolved or if it cant be resolved i will try and distract myself (one distraction I bite the sides of my fingers till the point it bleeds)it like im always in my mind and never in the real worlds because of this, the way I get out is that I seem to realise and snap myself out of it but if people are talking to me I can go complty in my head even if i dont want to and start to fantiszie (usually about me sorting problems out or a problem being resolved) the thoughts can be about people, Like if someone is hurtful towards be my mind will constantly go over this and i start to get really bad anixity and feel quite embarrassed like im real living it, I get to the point with people that they could do one mean thing but in my mind because i keep relving it and then I start to see other """"""""mean"""""""" things they do, that I just cut them out of my life and become really bitter towards them even if they done nothing else wrong. this has affected my jobs and education (ive quite many jobs and droped out of education often) and ive just started back at universtiy and i felt happy for 2 weeks but it all started up again to the point i hardly am in lesson and i just want to keep to myself

Okay, this one's a little bit embarrassing. And before I go any further, I apologise if this causes offence to anyone.
As some of you know I'm a fan of Hollyoaks and during my last term at Uni, I became... eh... slightly obsessed with it, you could say and began to watch old clips on Youtube. :lol: I got some ideas for a """"""""McDean"""""""" fanfiction (ie, the relationship between Craig Dean and John-Paul McQueen) one night and I desperately wanted to write it down. However, some of you also know that I was reluctant to write it because of the whole thing with Father Kieron - viewers of the show will know that he gave up the priesthood to go into a relationship with JP and while all that was going on on telly last year I was reluctant to watch the show because I was still suffering badly from OCD; I thought it """"""""wasn't allowed"""""""" but hey, it's a teen soap on mainstream television that shows after school before the watershed! Something tells me it'll be okay! :lol:
Yet despite all this, as I became more confident and began to get watch more and more clips, I eventually decided to watch a few with Father Kieron and just became more confident. But all the same I guess you could say I felt guilty about it and I asked my Mum about it. She's a Catholic and she said that she believed that priests could go into relationships if it was what their hearts told them. I think I was going through a reassurance stage.

Was I doing it on purpose, just so I could have something to worry about? Did I go after it only because I thought it was wrong?

I'm NightFire, I'm Female, 21, & I'm from Wiltshire [in England].
I found this forum as I was searching for people to talk to about my O.C.D-as nobody I know has it, or can understand it, & it's really difficult for me. :down:
I've had O.C.D for about 10 years [it's not been diagnosed, but I know that I have it]. I think that it was triggered when I was 11, & my family & I moved to a different area [& a house instead of a flat], & I had to go to a new Primary School . I think that it was a way for me to try & control my life more.
To give you an idea of some of the things I do/experience I'll write some below;
*Hoarding [mainly mags, & books].
*Checking [my room, my bag, myself, etc].
*Timetables [of what I should do every day, week, & month]
*Daily routine [certain things in a certain order].
*Routine cleaning.
*Negative, paranoid thoughts [about myself & others].
*Checking things online [like forum posts, my myspace page, etc].
*Trying to do everything 'perfectly'.
*Trying to give myself a 'life makeover' every now & again.
*Getting panic attacks, & depressed when things in my life 'don't feel right'.
I used to go to a Pychiatrist when I was alot younger [when I found out that my Dad was actually my Step-Dad], & I've been to a Counceller a few years ago after self harming a little [not much though]-but it didn't really help.
But I've never been to the Doctor about O.C.D [although I've thought about it], or been on any medication for it. I hate the thought of going on medication-as I'm Vegan, & I only take The Pill, & Paracetemol [which I only take at that time of the month!]. Other than that I take B-Vitamins, & Multi-Vitamins & Minerals. I hardly ever get ill, & [physically] I'm really healthy.
I also suffer from Depression [again, undiagnosed]-which I think is linked to my O.C.D.
Anyway...that's some background info about me I thought that I'd share-sorry for the essay!. :lol:

I don't think that I've posted on here since my intro-but my life has been a bit manic lately.
Anyway; I just feel like everything is getting on top of me again...
I have so many thoughts going around in my mind, so many things that I want to do in my life that seem impossible, & so many things about myself, & my life that I constantly find fault in, that it's driving me mad. I just feel like life is totally overwhelming me at the moment.
The past 2 days have been really good; I went out with a School friend that I hadn't seen in ages on Sat eve, & it was ace-we had a great heart to heart about our lives. Then last night my 2 Best Friends came round, & we all had a laugh. But today I had one of those; 'I have to totally make-over my life because it's ****' feelings, & it's ruined it all.
I have a Dr's appointment today [which isn't related to OCD-as I don't *quite* feel ready for that yet], & a Psychology lesson later [which I'm freaking out about as I only have a week in which to do my Coursework, & I haven't even started it yet]-but I'm considering boycotting Psychology [again] as I feel like I can't handle it, as I'm losing my mind at the moment. :eek:
Here are some of the things that are getting me down;
Work: I work Part-Time, & I love my job & everyone that I work with-but I *really* need to get a Full-Time job asap as I'm not making nearly enough money to get by.
College: There's the Psychology Coursework issue, & the fact that I'm most likely going to fail GCSE Maths [again].
Career: I have dreams of studying Hollistic Therapies, & moving to Southern Ireland-but it seems impossible for me to ever do.
Family: All we seem to do is argue :argue:, & they can't seem to understand how I feel about anything [especially concerning my OCD]. I feel like I need to escape from living with them.
Friends: I always feel really insecure about my relationship with my friends, & what they really think of me, etc.
Love Life: It's non-existant! I have issues with trusting people, & I feel lke I'm going to be a Virgin, & alone forever at this rate.
General: The facts that I'm 22 this year, still living at home, not at Uni yet, not driving yet, don't have hardly any money, & generally aren't very independant at the moment are always on my mind.
I'm trying not to cry as I'm writing this-but I just feel like a complete loser...
I just don't know where to start on improving my situation & my life. I always put loads of pressure on myself, & give myself high standards to live up to-so therefore I tend to fail. So any advice that anyone can give me would be *greatly* appreciated.
Also; I am planning on going to the Dr's about my OCD/Depression very soon-I'm just plucking up the courage!
Peace & Love;

"Hi,
My name's Rebecca and I'm new here!
I haven't ever been medically diagnosed with OCD but I am definitely sure I have it, I can't talk to my parents about it and it doesn't bother me enough that I feel I need help desperately, it's just there for me.
Anyway, I decided to join this forum because although all my friends think they know loads about OCD (some still think it stands for overly cleanliness disorder- they will never learn) it's very frustrating to try to explain it to them as they enjoy making me skwerm akwardly when they move my things (I went on a trip to London with the drama department at school for three days and one boy spent every moment we were in the coach undoing my seat belt, something that is fair enough to be irritated by, and moving my arm rest slightly to the left).
I write a lot. I am currently writing a glee fanfiction (stories using characters already created and posting them online) about a guy who has OCD and it becomes worse as he is bullied and teased and has to move schools.

"Hi all,
Had a good time at the McFly concert (Dude! I did it; I went to a concert and like, didn't have a breakdown! :clapping: ) and now I'm back home again. But suddenly, I feel a bit down and out...
My friends are arranging to go out tonight and asked if I'd like to come; I wanted to, but I can't drive, none of my friends could come and pick me up, I don't know the town they're meeting in massively well and don't know the bus-times and my Mum and Dad couldn't give me a lift for various reasons.
And suddenly I got this big ol' wave of sadness and just had to go and sit on the swing for a bit. I suddenly felt mildly depressed and upset; didn't want to talk to anyone, didn't want to do anything, just wanted to be left alone.
And the OCD took the opportunity to kick in. I just got that whole """"""""My life sucks"""""""" kinda thing and had to take some deep breaths. I just felt all """"""""Blah"""""""" and although I know God knows how I feel inside and that most of my OCD is simply in my imagination; it ain't real. But sometimes I'm scared of just ruining my life for good although I know it'll never happen. Which is brill because I know I can live my life my way. It's just a 'what if...' I pick up the phone and I'm scared I might say the wrong thing, then.
But I won't. Not today, not tomorrow, not the day after that, or the day after that, or the day after that...

"Hi gang,
Hope you're all okay this morning, I for one am feeling a little peculiar. Nothing new there than.
I think my OCD is using my thoughts against me. The other night I was getting ready for bed and I normally tend to think about sex a lot when I'm waiting to go to sleep. Anyway, this particular night I had a couple of naughty thoughts that are taboo in my religion and I was praying for help. My therapist had affirmed it was wrong, I knew it was wrong. I only remember one or two brief flashes of thought and of course you can't remember every little thing you thought. Heck, you can't remember everything you did the night before, can you?
Anyway, I was lying on one side and I remember looking at the white desk that's next to my bed and having a big jumbled thought about forgiveness - thinking deeply and I remember having an image of me walking around feeling sad - and then I rolled over and looked the other way. My OCD kicked in and I began to think that I was sinning by just having that one thought. It's not the first time I've had a feeling like that - I have a harmless thought and it's bombs away for the OCD! I do remember before I drifted off asking God to help me, to deliver me. Then in the morning it came back.
Now I think my OCD's got me thinking that I indulged in these thoughts with the intention to ask forgiveness in the morning and also that I'd have something to worry about. But the fact is, I think it's just pure OCD. I seem to be thinking now that I don't deserve anything but the truth is I just feel loved so much. I feel like the Big Guy is rooting for me.
But I don't understnad why I think I've done wrong. I was feeling better last night. I just can't comprehend why I think I've done something wrong. I wanted to know if OCD uses anyone else's thoughts against them like this. It feels like OCD now I've written it down. It was just this niggling, this feeling of being undeserving.","['hope', 'serving', 'OCD', 'Thought']",1,1,1,0,0,0.0,"['image', 'thought']","['ocd', 'image', 'thought', 'serving', 'hope']",,

I get out of bed to find one of the cats managed to get locked behind a door so she pood so I had to clear that up.
I keep forgetting things to put in a bag to take to work and then I am 15 minutes late.
The car feels like it's driving on jelly or super glue depending on where Saturn is in the sky over Cassiopeia apparently........
Then I am in work and I am trying to focus on things but I keep yawning and I feel sick - nauseous - like every morning for the past 2 weeks (I swear I'm pregnant!!!).
So my colleague is talking to me about really important stuff and I am assaulted by unwelcome visions of accidents or fighting or situations where I am being hurt or attacked by people - which triggers my defensive side and the OCD throws visions of excessive violence into the mix against my detractors.............and at the same time I am supposed to be taking a brief for an important conversation.
I send a friend a couple of sms messages from my mobile - but I cannot do that too often as it's expensive...........and I cannot call her cos I am surrounded by people who understand enough English to know that it's not about work!!!
She asks me, """"""""What do you need right now to make you feel a bit better?"""""""" - well, what I need is impossible right now to get - that's the hardest part to accept - the fact that at this precise moment in time, I am all alone (there isn't even anyone else logged into the board right now) fighting this and it's ripping my mind apart - I just want to scream and cry and cry scream and cry some more then sleep for a week.............
The self-destructive aspect of my OCD/ADHD wants to rip my head open and spread my brains on the keyboard so I can smash the thoughts to a pulp. It makes me want to drive my car at 160km/h into the nearest river bridge and flush my low self-esteem into the Bottnian Gulf.
So I call my mother (some of you may recall her profession - she's forgotten more about OCD than I think I will ever learn!) - voicemail.

It was like my OCD was supplying the guilt without any actual sin and I just don't think I've done anything wrong. I know I'm better than that. Anyway, everytime I have a thought that I'm supposed to have indulged in, I physically recoil.
I think I accepted that I'd done something wrong because my OCD made me believe that I had sin in a just-so thought. It's like I say something harmless and in my head it becomes harmful, you know and before long I think I've said wrong. It's not the first time something like this has happened and got me in such a state.
So I think the OCD has been hurting me because of this thought I had about forgiveness and worry and because of a few naughty thoughts. I can't even remember it now.

I'm sorry I haven't been around much, but, it's back. For some reason everything I watch is triggering me, it doesn't help that half the shows i've been watching seem to have paedophiles in them at the moment. I want to go back to avoiding it, but it's pretty much too late now anyway! I have exams coming up, I went on antidepressants in January, my dog nearly died, my step-dad's father died, everything has been pretty tough. I thought I was making progress, in fact I was doing really well, then I had exams in March, and everything with my dog and my family happened, and now I have more exams, and just, eurgh.
It definitely hasn't been a good few months, and I guess it's starting to take it's toll. I'm going to make an appointment with my doctor for the 11th, that's the next time I'm back in Birmingham, and I'm running out of tablets. Unsure whether or not to ask him to up the dose, I'm also getting therapy at the moment, but with revision and trying to juggle everything else I haven't been able to go for a while, and it's for the depression, not my OCD. My doctor has been amazing about my depression, really understanding and helpful, he got me therapy in a week on the NHS (!) and we discussed tablets a lot before I went on them, and I really felt that it was my decision and was very comfortable with it.
Although my doctor is great, i've always been hesitant about seeing anybody in the NHS about my paedophile thoughts (gahhh, that is NOT getting easier to say! lol). I've always seen a private counsellor back at home for CBT, but i'm rarely home now, so it's very inpractical for me to see her on a regular basis again. I want to be a clinical psychologist, i'm headed in the right direction at the moment, and I don't want this to go down on any records or anything. I've only ever wanted to work in the care proffession, I don't know what I'd do if that was taken away from me.
My boyfriend (who knows everything) has been on shift since Friday night pretty much, which hasn't helped, too much time to think and as he's doing shifts it's ended up mucking up my sleep as well. I guess I should talk to him about it, but it's difficult to say 'Hey honey, how was work? By the way, I couldn't revise today because I think I might be a paedophile again' :dry: Also, saying it out loud makes it real, and I don't want to have to fight this again.

I constantly question my motives for doing or saying something before I even get to say/do it, I """"""""feel the fear and do it anyway"""""""", and just end up feeling horrible in the end. I thought overcoming OCD involved learning to deal with your fears, but it's horrible every time I try to do that. And I do expose myself to my fears a lot!

"Hey Guys,
I dunno what im really trying to achieve here, just venting really i suppose.
I went to the doctors last night, and am now regretting it. My mum doesnt want anythnig to do with OCD, and she doesnt want me to go to doctors, its got to such a point that i get really nervous when even thinking of the subject. So i told her i was at a meeting with the headteacher. On the way to doctors after school, i saw her picking my sister up, and said the meeting was cancelled and i was gonig to my friend (alex)'s house. So she drove off. Anyways i was walking with my other friend matthew past the doctors, and she was parked outside it, getting a prescription.
So i came up with another excuse that Alex's mum didn't want me there, so i was dropping something off at Matthews house. Anyways she sat in the car for about 5 or 10 minutes, and then left, in which i proceeded to the doctors.
Not only was there my mums friends in there, but relatives aswell. So i just walked past, signed in and went upstairs. When i was with the doctor, he said there was nothing he could do, and its too dificult to diagnose me, and i need to see a psychiatrist. He also wants a chat with my parents before we continue.
So how am i supposed to do that? He then made me re-live my violent and sexual thoughts, and speak about them. That made me really upset, it was awful.
Then he said next time he sees me he wants a list of all the Obsesions i have had, written down every time i get one. So ive started doing that.
---- * ----
Yesterday lunch i went outside, to find that people were spreading rumours about me, but i wont say what they are. But now lots of people think stuff about me and its awful. I was walking to school this morning and i could see people staring at me, saying """"""""Thats Him!"""""""" etc. (The rumours ARENT true!).
At break today, withing about 30 seconds of stepping onto the playground, and apple was thrown at my head. And everything is just getting worse for me.
Last night, i thought i had about 5 friends being:
- Alex
- Cat
- Rachel
- Matthew
- Nat
Anyways today, after getting more greif i was in a bit of a mood on the way home walknig with the top four. So when i was walking down Alex's street, he was saying he bet i couldnt carry a few sand bags. Now im not the strongest of people, but i managed 1 (Yes lets all laugh at Adam). Then this little girl - about 3 years younger then me, managed to pick one up, and throw it at my Waist, and it wasnt the most delightful experience i have ever had, it kind of stung ALOT.
So i was kind of stupid, and thought i dont need greif from ANYBODY else. So i thew her PE bag onto the road. In which Alex had a go at me, and told me to leave his property, Cat and Rachel called me Pathetic, and the little girl, Kicked Me as hard as she could. There that removes the top three friends, now i have two.
I accidently fell on matthew after tripping up and he had a huge go at me, and smacked me accross the shoulder, so i hit him back, and stormed off.
Now we are down to one friend. Nat. Who today had a huge go at me over nothing and told me to """"""""**** off"""""""". I have no clue what i have done, but she seems to dislike me, so i now have No Friends.
Yay me - im a loner.

The self harm has been getting bad again recently, and my upper arms are covered in cuts. I feel like i cant commit suicide, because somebody wants to make me suffer. I feel like i should be punished for everythnig i do and i cant take it any more.
Im starting to feel that somebody has made my friends go away from me, so that if i do commit suicide, they won't miss me.
Pressure at school is starting to become unbearable, i really cant stand any of this, and i have nobody to talk to. Because my non-existant friends dont want to listen, my parents arent going to listen etc.

"Nobody knew how their mental health would handle the Covid-19 crisis- myself included. I sort of felt like I was treading on eggshells, waiting for the relapse. I struggled at first with intrusive mental images of the virus living on human skin, this make me have fear all the time as well as trying not to let the OCD snatch hold of the hand-washing (for a second there I was singing Amazing Grace twice through rather than Happy Birthday) but strangely after a month or so my brain fell quiet. 
The OCD didn’t disappear completely, but it became waaaay more manageable. I know there is no reason for believing in thoughts. physical checking behaviours halted, the mental checking ceased, and the preoccupation with pathogens retreated.

"OK I don't know where talking about this will get me, but my news phobia is...worse than ever, I don't sleep, I don't rest, I don't eat and I'am constantly anxious.
I feel as though I'm living in a very sureal world, like I'm trapped inside a nightmare. I wont say what it is on the news that is bothering me, because talking about the subject will only further highten my nerves.
I do have a trouble facing my fears and find i only very briefly read a story, if i read it at all, but talking about the actual subject on the news would be too much for me right now.
It is not the actual subject that is bothering me so much, but, there is somebody who lives far away and that somebody means the world to me and right now I feel and I am completly helpless to protect them if anything happened.
I have not slept, or eaten or rested properly in over three months, my OCD that was getting a little better is worse than ever. I have given myself ulcers and migranes and toothache from nerves and yet i feel that worrying is the only thing i can do.
Worry and Pray and I feel that if i suffer in some way that might protect this person, as worry and suffer is the only thing i can do.
I really do not talk about my nerves anymore, I don't think anybody can help me with them and I don't know why I'm writing about this either.

"Today I saw a girl who looked between the ages of maybe 11-16, its hard to tell as she was very well endowed. However, her face looked quite young and she was with her mum and a younger sister, which led me to believe she was quite young. She was also wearing quite childish clothes. I have a fetish for large breasts and so I found myself quite turned on and I couldn't stop thinking about her breasts and imagined myself having sex with her. What disturbs me is whilst I was imagining having sex with her, I imagined myself saying to her 'did mummy buy that bra for you?' and it really turned me on. Obviously this worries me as, why would I have had this thought if I hadn't had the idea of her being a child in the back of my mind.
I kept feeling aroused, and later on I gave in to my arousal and masturbated over her. What is worse, is whilst I was masturbating, I believed her to be around 11 or 12 and in my fantasy, I say to her, 'you're a little overdeveloped for your age aren't you?' and she replies 'I know I am do you want to **** me?'. This for some reason really turned me on. I was mainly attracted to her breasts and not her age, but I don't know why I would incorporate her age into the fantasy? I don't seek out young girls. I have only ever masturbated over girls from at least 14 and up. I'm 19 myself. Maybe its the taboo of having sex with a young girl who is overly developed and so is physically appealing, but is morally off-limits. The idea of having sex with a prepubescent child sickens me, so why does this turn me on? Why does the idea that she is young turn me on? It's confusing and distressing and I just need some guidance and advice.

"Alot of OCD is put in a category such as the excessive hand washing thing or the hoarding thing or the self-harm thing but .... I have such an extensive mixed bag of OCD it is very hard to pin it down to one thing. When I went to the OCD conference in London a few years ago, I had severe difficulty deciding which 'class' to go to as i have a bit of everything. I will give you a brief account of a typical day - now this may go on so i'll keep it brief.
I will get up - get to the bathroom : first thing. I have a thing with taps. If I turn a tap on it will takes me aaaaaaaaaaaaaaages to turn it off. I will turn it on, off, on off for ages so I have taken to fill a bucket of water (2-3 times a weeK) and jug it out into the basin and use that (cold).
Getting dressed can take up to 20 minutes to half hour. We're not talking figuring out what to wear - we are talking putting on a pair of trousers and a top. Im that bad at putting my bra on with the clasp business (on, off, on, off), I end up sleeping in it and end up having one on 24/7 (obviously when I change it, it is when I get in from work so its not last thing at night or first thing so I can take time).
Then when I am about to leave the house I hve a ritual thing and I have to look at my light in the mirror and then my lamp on the floor and say bye to them???? about so many times (madness). Then I say bye to my pets in a sort of way and say a little prayer thing (like Ashley, I am not religious at all but I have to do it).
Then outside my door, again, I say bye to my pets for another say, 5 minutes. I have to make sure they look at me before I go to shut the door. I will swing the door back and forth countless times until im satisfied before locking it.
Just to do a simple wash, dress, say bye to the animals and lock the door takes me nearly 2 hours every morning.
When I use a squeezy bottle for anything: washing up liquid, shampoo, bubblebath, I squeeze nearly all the stuff out before I use it. Costs me a fortune.
Wow.. right. cards .......... table... completely out for everyone to see! Please please someone please tell me you endure the same things. Is this pure O or is this a bit of everything?

"Hi all
For some while now I have been feeling really down about lack of friends / living alone and lack of big family Christmas. December the 6th I was diagnosed with diabetes which was a bit of a blow. The not so obvious problem was that with diabetes, the medication I am on (olanzapine) is having to be changed over to aripiprozole as olanzapine can cause diabetes as well as worsen it.
4 days into the transition I am starting to get ruminating thoughts, which delve into the depths of my brain trying to find reason in everything that goes wrong in my life. Thoughts that are trying to explain why I have only 1 friend who lives 200 miles away, why I have lived alone for nearly 4 years and have not ever had a girlfriend that has lasted more than 10 minutes, thoughts like I am not meant for all of these things as I am meant for something else, as if I am destined to be alone for a supernatural reason.

Having a REALLY bad day. It's probably a mixture of my ocd and anxiety....
I have panics about getting ill, catching things, etc....mainly because when I feel unwell I go into a sheer panic - feeling like i'm going to die....it seems unlike other people i really cannot stand the feeling of being unwell, that is anything that involves nausea, faintness.....and unfortunately I witnessed someone die suddenly and I keep having that image going around and thinking that could happen too if i'm ill.
I'm particularly like this when I travel....
Today I returned from an event that is only 100 miles away because I was finding the whole thing 'too much.' Just everything from the numbers of people there, the queue for food....I kept having thoughts 'i don't have the energy for this,' and also i didn't sleep a wink so I was convinced that I would be feeling faint or sick by the end of the day ......so i left before that even had a chance to happen. :-(
I should go back tomorrow....I want to - it's just that as soon as I get there (it's a busy event) I feel like i'm in another world.....
My panic got so bad today that the wrist tag that they give you - i ripped it off because i felt claustrophobic with it around my wrist!
I thought once I got home I would feel differently, calm down a bit - I have a bit but not enough - nowhere near what I usually am.....and I have to go back tomorrow, I want to i've spent a lot of money on this event and I know it's good for me to push a bit harder.....tonight is my respite but to stay home is avoidance.
Can anyone help? Right now I could cry all night. It'sw not specific to ocd - although there's a bit of 'if i could only guaratee 100% that i don't get ill, then I could enjoy the event...' So i'm trying to get the certainty that Dr Grayson talks about...
thanks for listening :-( :-( :-( :-( (by the way i live alone - and I can't even call anyone because people are so judgemental about it - they just get more and more into the label and they are not helpful - so I don't want anyone to know....but it means i feel so alone)","['anxiety', 'anxiety', 'nausea', 'Food', 'joy', 'syncope', 'OCD', 'Thought']",1,1,0,0,0,0.0,"['image', 'thought']","['ocd', 'food', 'syncope', 'image', 'joy', 'thought', 'anxiety', 'nausea']",,

"All my worries are about saying or implying bad about dad, especially in terms of saying he's done or said anything untoward to me.
Earlier with friend who got in my car I said how r u? and she said 'I've been pi££ed off today' and i started to say something because i think i thought she was referring to when we were bickering earlier on but quickly realised she meant with work. I'm worried tho that for a second i thought she meant something sinister or i ahd it in my head that it was something sinister and spoke based on that, simply because all i think about is sinister stuff.
She also said 'I can't believe its end of march already, time flies' and i said 'i know its creepy' and have panicked like 'why did i use the word creepy?'
My main concern is I was telling friends a story i read about a man trying to kill this woman in her own room and I said something like 'u wouldn't be able to scream tho, its like when u...' and i changed it to 'like i read that if you are that scared, u can't even scream'. now I'm petrified thinking what did i actually say, what did it imply and what the hell did i mean? for some reason i think i had like a faint memory of being young and trying to cry out and couldn't but I'm petrified that I've made it up and am remembering it as my dad being untoward with me when i best not be cos that will not be true at all and i will be distraught if iv mentioned it based on thinking that!! I kind of feel i remember dreaming something like that where i was trying to call out for whatever reason and couldn't, and kind of feel i remember being younger and just scared at night, NOTHING TO DO WITH DAD! just like house noises or id watched something horrible on tv or just scared like kids get in the dark at night occasionally. But what if I'm remember thinking at the time 'is that dad?' hearing a noise and not being able to scream? Maybe thinking it was him in a bad way or hoping it was him i could hear and not some stranger in our house. Ah I'm so scared of myself and my mind. My dad is such a lovely man.
Even driving this evening with my friends, twice i was like 'ah' as I went to interrupt my friend speaking to say something else, like once was cos i thought i missed turning to other friends house and can't remember other but i think did i do it intentionally because she said something sinister or about dads being pervy or something'
Also at bar i was saying a man was fit. Im 24 and i said lets hope he's 40. I like older men when not that old i guess and i don't know why i said it. I knew my friend would be like 'ew thats like your dads age' and she did, and i laughed and said 'oh yeah, oh yeah maybe not'. But I'm so worried whether i raised eyebrows or pulled a face as if to say 'i know, and?'. Is that like I'm saying i like my dad in a fanciable way or so what if he's like a dad age? Was i saying it like kind of a joke? DiD I just not care or think about what it would imply, did i think she wouldn't be sure what i meant so doesn't matter. Did i said 'i know, and?' or 'and?' or 'so' or 'i know' cos i know ports sounds like I'm saying i like that fact but 'i know, and?' would more mean 'so what, its only an age'. But i think id say it to test myself, to see what it implied and what she thought? please help me. Do i fancy dad? for a second when speaking do i just not know what i think or mean because I'm so up in my head that i end up saying and implicating all this weird stuff because i don't know what I'm about anymore?

"Hello everyone
i had my second therapy session the other day, after hvg missed last week's one due to feeling awful and we talked about the self perpetuating cycle of anxiety, punishment, perfectionism that i am on. He did a diagram of the cycle, which just helped to reinforce the idea clearly at a time when i feel i have failed big time and cant see my way out of my troubled mind at all..
Yesterday, despite not feeling right or happy about doing it, i went ahead and bought something that i had been trying to for nearly a week. It was something that had broken which i wanted to replace. Beforehand i had got into thinking that i couldnt get it and the feeling was very strong and this for me is hard to get out of and takes time, effort and misery. Anyway, as i said, i didnt wait 'till i felt i was allowed, but bought it anyway (it is on order) and the same day went and had my hair done which i have been thinking about for ages. I hoped that i could start feeling ok soon but the anxiety and lack of peace of mind from doing these things and what has led up to them is driving me crazy. i cannot think straight and wonder if i will have to return the item if i cant settle down which is the worry (i cannot of course return my hair which is partly why i went to the hairdressers yesterday - to make myself live with it - maybe a wrong approach? i dont know.)
I've had a gutful of lately and feel that i made bad, unnecessary, habitful choices that caused the misery. So i went for the 2 exposures above to try to show that i can be strong and 'do the correct thing', but i am really scared that i don't deserve to feel okay about having the things and that i haven't done the exposure right - too much at wrong time or whatever. I also think that i did it because i couldn't stand to be without things any more, not because it was right to do it.
I regret that recently i have not been able to take the baton and run with it when i felt good about things and had a bit of progress under my belt. i blame myself terribly for messing up that chance and now i am having to stomach this self enforced exposure which i had to do in desperation. i dont know if it is possible to live peacefully with what ive done and accept its right.
I know this is a long post but i really need some feedback on the points above 'cos i've been seriously lost and floundering for a week now, having previously, for the first time, made a small but important step or a bit of a step towards helping myself. Does this make sense to anyone. i feel that i've jepordised my peace of mind, progress and also credibilty. I hope you were able to bear with me , i need some answers please i'm feel i'm losing myself and am confused and scared. what does anyone think?

"hey, i dont know if this is the right place to say this, but it describes depression on the forum description thing.
Apart from the ocd thoughts, there are 2 things that are bothering me. the first is that im really really paranoid all the time, and i dont know how to stop it. like, in class if i hear someone laugh i get convinced its at me somehow, and i know its irational. also, im really convinced that everytime i try to say something, or answer a question, everyone laughs, because they do laugh, but i think im being silly to think its at me. but i cant help it. im getting more confident at college, but if i walk past someone and they move their hand, i flinch. its very annoying, but i cant stop that reaction. its getting to the point that im having to tense my body as i walk past people just to control that, but that makes me look strange, so people are more likley to give me trouble.
the second thing is that i keep hearing voices. in the past ive heard voices, and i see things. ive heard 3 voices recently, and usually i would dismiss it as just mis hearing things, but ive identified it as the start of what happens. i hear a voice every so often, until before i know it there are what sounds like 2 people standing outside my bedroom door having a conversation, or talking to me. it doesnt bother me as such, as im not scared, but i know there must be something wrong if im hearing voices.","['depression', 'OCD', 'Thought', 'outside', 'bedroom', 'talking']",0,0,0,0,0,0.0,"['thought', 'hand']","['ocd', 'talking', 'depression', 'thought', 'bedroom', 'outside', 'hand']",,

"Hi.
I haven't been on here in a while so said I would come back and do an update. It positive to see lots of new people on the boards and I hope that the regular posters from 6 months ago are out there dealing with their OCD issues. Remember these boards are great to learn but are also a form of reassurance which will hold you back from fully functioning.
I am delighted to say I am well on the way to recovery. I can get through my daily routine with relative OCD ease. I do get more anxious towards the end of a work day but I notice I get more and more time each week. Larger events are more difficult but even these do not provoke the same anxiety as before (although I am quite worried about going away for a wedding for a full week this month). In saying that at least I am in a place now where I can handle it.
Recovery for me has been slow. It was July 12 months ago when I began to recognise my problem as OCD and it took a full year before I would say my problem was largely manageable. After the year mark things have started to become easier and gains are somewhat exponential. I would describe tackling OCD as trying to dismantle an massive block of ice with an ice pick. Initially you chop away, little by little with no observable effect. Then over time the ice begins to thaw and the chunks falling off are bigger and bigger until you are pulling away strips.
The most important tool for me tackling this has been ERP. I have put myself into OCD provoking situations as often as possible to create anxiety and constantly test myself. I look at my month ahead and see what I can do new in the month ahead that will provoke my OCD and help me to build coping techniques. In July it was to join a public speaking club. This month it was to start working out with a new work out buddy.
I have done OCD to the point of exhaustion. I have been physically ill alot over the last year as the stress from dealing with OCD has made me susceptible to common colds and flu. I notice how my days and weeks tire me out and then try to add on ERP exercises when I am at my lowest ebb. I then compare my frame of mind to a month ago or several months ago and improvements become more marked with time.
Another key to unlocking OCD is no longer fearing your theme. If you do this you remove all of OCDs power. This may involve temporarily accepting absolutely terrifying things. Once you no longer fear the reaper you can reassess when you have some perspective on what is true or not.
Stopping my reassurance activities has been another important step. Attention to detail is very important here. I have had some help from a therapist and he helped me to identify all my reassurance techniques and to spot myself doing them in real time and then stopping them. The real key here is to identify when you are doing them. Not easy but again over time it becomes easier.
I hope people on here are ok. These boards have been very useful to me getting through this.

"Hello,
Recently my faith in God has increased considerably these last few weeks and I do notice a difference in my OCD because of this. Having faith is helping me to deal with OCD in a different way. My OCD does try to doubt my faith but I won't let it deceive me. I was wondering that if mentally blocking out OCD thoughts again and again could do some long term damage to someone later in life. I don't know if it's possible and I hope it's not. Occasionally I get a splitting headache and I wonder if it is due to mentally blocking out OCD thoughts. With my faith increased now I usually let the thoughts through, because they are not mine and God knows this. I know that non- OCD people get thoughts that they don't like but they dismiss them. With me a thought may try to hound me until I am physically crying or end up arguing with it, in which case it wins. Getting angry with a certain distressing thought makes OCD stronger. It doesn't matter if you are the nicest person in the world, you will still get distessing thoughts at some point. I think this is due to your brain/mind trying to make sense of the world we live in. I've mentined this technique before but I'll say it again in case anbody reading this doesn't know of it: if a distressing thought comes, think to yourself OCD, so that your brain/mind can register it as an OCD thought, and the thought should go away.

To disassemble the system completely from my car, sell it and leave the Factory Radio back on, so finally OCD will completely let me alone. On the other hand I doubt if my OCD leaves me alone after performing the ritual, and at the same time this is impossible, because of the exams I decided to do for my own career future. I am afraid to perform that ritual and disassemble the Audio system from my car. I don't know if it is a ritual or the last task I will have to perform before my OCD leaves me alone. If really a ritual it is a big ritual. I will have to open the car completely and it takes time and energy at meantime I feel no reason to do that. I don't feel I can do it right now. I have other more significant priorities to do....
What I need here is a human touch to my problem and not doctors.....I need humans who suffered from similar conditions and they are experienced face to face with the condition.
People do not tolerate my strange, stuck, personality and leave me before they know me. I wish I had some good friends, but I am totally left alone in this world.

"Hi guys long time no see!
Well like I said ten days free of my meds. My gp wanted me to get off of them because of my blood pressure and I tried once before but couldn't do it. This time is going pretty well. I do get kinda scared sometimes as the pure o is a lot stronger without the meds and I feel like at times my depression has started to come back.
A lot has happened this weekend I had to go to two funerals and deal with a lot of heartache. Sometimes I feel like having all the emotions back are more than I can handle. Does anybody get this? Like you can go through life numb from the meds fine but not feeling things? Anyway, I am proud of myself for dealing with my ocd without my safety net. I don't want to pat myself on the back but rather everybody on this site. You all helped me learn how to live with my illness. Thank you.
May you all have Happy Holidays!

I then came across ocduk. in the late year of 2004.
Caramoole /Ashley and others were around , and with help from them , and others , i made a full recovery from ocd and have remained free ever since.
Huge thanks for that , but also say a huge thanks for providing the information and knowledge i have gained , because from that , over the last 10 years i have been able to offer help and advice in the same way , to the point of actually changing people lives for the better

"My friend partly influenced me to do this as an idea, and I think it could be beneficial to most people on this forum. Basically, when you suffer from OCD, it's very easy to get sucked up into negative feelings. Bad thoughts, bad moods, bad everything. And I've started doing this in order to remind myself that, actually, even in the thick of all this nastiness, there are still things that can be valued and make us happy.
So basically, the idea is this: Keep a diary for 100 days straight in which you make at least one entry every day about what made you happy. These things can be as big or small as you deem appropriate. It doesn't have to be as personal as I've done it (I'm keeping a diary), for example, my friend is putting up a picture on facebook every day of one thing that made her happy. It doesn't have to be huge, you don't have to force it, and you don't have to always feel like it's 'worthy' of an entry. It just has to be SOMETHING. For example, my first entry was coffee. The day of that entry was horrible, awful stress from college, awful time with the OCD, awful time with the people in my waking life... Rubbish day. BUT. The one thing I always look forward to is a black coffee when I get in from college. So, I put it in the diary.
This idea doesn't have to be limited to 100 days. You could do 365. You could only do 50 if you wanted. Hell, you could only do a week if you wanted to. But I'm only two days in and I can already feel a bit of a difference. And when it's over, I'm going to look back over the whole thing, a and I'll see nothing but things that made me happy. There will be no mention of OCD, no mention of exams, no mention of anything negative. Just one thing every day that made me feel a little bit happy.
Anyway, it's just a suggestion, but I think it's a good thing, just because it's not exactly difficult to commit to and you can't really cheat at it because it's a self-fulfilling thing anyway.
Hope this helps somebody and good luck

"12 years ago, I freed myself through the Grace of God from O.C.D. after being severely afflicted by it for most of my life and an especially intense 5 years. All I did to overcome it was simply the opposite of everything I felt compelled to do. If I wanted things straight, I'd make them crooked. Perfect, then imperfect. Clean, then messy. It was one of the most liberating experiences of my life! I sort of transformed into a circus clown for a bit of time due to how much glee and freedom I felt. Don't let anyone tell you that it is only something that can be coped with but not fully healed. I am 1,000% healed, and you can be to! When you feel a bit of tension due to some obsessive habit not being obeyed, just know that that tension will steadily decrease as you continue to joyfully disobey what you feel needs to be ordered, straightened, etc.. I wish you complete success! I have another friend who also became fully healed due to someone simply telling him in regards to his unseemly habits, """"""""Just stop doing it."""""""" It IS as simple as that and, once again, remember that any initial tension due to not performing a certain habit will eventually be replaced by exuberant freedom! Doing the opposite is most certainly the quickest way to taste that freedom as opposed to simply not doing the habit. Enjoy making it through this unusual spiritual initiation!

"Hi everyone. It is my day 5 taking citalopram 10g.
I have heen suffering from OCD that makes me fear of disease and death. Particularly I'm afraid of rabies, as a month ago my right hand was cut by wire after a vaccinated dog had licked the hand. Also it bit me lightly and no obvious wounds were left. I know the fear is irrational and I keep searching information from internet.
Medication's side effects make me even more anxious. These days I suffer from increased anxiety and depression. I feel headache and pain in my hands and legs including the part cut by wire as mentioned above. This recalls my fear of rabies. I keep touching my forehead to know whether I have fever. And, as you may guess, yes, I am eager to find information about the medicine's side effects. I just can't focus.
Are these common side effects of citalopram? What can I do to help myself? Thank you.

"Hi everyone,
I gave birth 11 days ago to a gorgeous little girl. 
I have 3 older children from my previous relationship, the youngest being 14 so a bit gap! Historically for me OCD has always got worse during pregnancy, the worst being when pregnant with my 14 year old but there was a lot of stress in my life at the time which I am sure didn't help.
Anyway, fast forward to now and OCD was manageable through pregnancy. It reared its head with the same old thoughts from time to time but I did ok. It has now been 11 days since the birth and I am struggling a bit.
My theme has always been 'what if I cheated and forgot' or 'what if I got pregnant from the toilet seat'. Same theme this time and not helped by the fact that it seems to have focused on the fact my partner has 2 older sons living at home and every time I see them it triggers the thoughts. I am trying really hard not to reassurance seek. I am struggling with rumination - re-tracing my steps, trying to prove if I did wrong or not and confessing the thoughts to my partner and my mum who have been great and know not to re-assure.
However, just the fact of discussing the thoughts themselves is making me feel dirty and guilty. Scared at what this type of thought means about me. I actually feel physically dirty and like I don't deserve to be happy. I am scared of spoiling it for my partner too. I feel like I need to prove 100% for this to stop :'(
It was quite a traumatic birth. I lost a lot of blood, found out I had strep b and baby had it from the swabs (they don't test routinely in the UK) and I spent days scared of losing her. After 3 sons i was ecstatic to be having a daughter.
Just a bit of history - I left an abusive marriage 2 years ago. My ex-husband was emotionally abusive (not all the time as he was lovely too). He threw my OCD at me in front of the kids which resulted in me almost having to justify myself and hope they didn't believe the thoughts. My ex managed to turn our 18 year old son against me and I miss him massively. He has said such awful things to me.
Anyway I have rambled on enough. Some advise would be greatly appreciated as I am back to thinking maybe I don't have OCD at all especially as the thoughts are back and I am with a different partner who is wonderful.

"Hello
First time here. My son is nearly 12 and is beside himself with anxiety. I have taken him to doctor doc said he has a social phobia (my son dosn't like eating in public). My son is also scared of being sick (he hasn't been sick for 5 years). At night he is scared of going to sleep incase he dosn't wake up and is frightened of something bad happening to us. I am taking him back to the doctors next week but felt the need to join here and possibly get some advice. last night we were both cooking dinner together and I ended up shouting at him (something I have never done) he reacted very badly and was beside himself. He explained that he felt everything was his fault and that he felt ashamed of himself. I re-assured him that he shouldn't feel that, and that sometimes people will get angry with him, and that he should just forget about it. Anyway it came time to eat, again he started crying saying that he had that feeling again (feeling that if he eats he will be sick). He did eat his dinner but not a lot. Im sorry to ramble but it has really helped me to write this. Looking back I can see he has a really big problem and that action is required as soon as possible. He is a high achiever at school and has friends so socially he is ok. Seems to revolve around eating and sleeping. Any advice would be appreciated.

"Hey everyone, my name is Callie Alice and I am 18 years old from Essex in the UK. I have been a severe sufferer of OCD for the past 11 almost 12 years. It began when I was 7, and I sadly lost my parents in a tragic accident, and not long after their death I developed Obsessive Compulsive Disorder. I have always thought myself kind of crazy, because my ritual is actually pretty dangerous and I have been in hospital due to effects of it on more than one occasion. My OCD revolves pretty much around numbers and magical thinking. I have huge supersticious thoughts but the main issue surrounds the number after 12. (Triskaidekaphobia) and the devils number. I can't say it or see it and when I do my ritual is counting loudly and repeating each number 7 times, and then I hurt myself. It is pretty scary, and I actually currently have my arm in a bandage after an event including scissors a few nights ago. (I'm okay ). In late August, I actually was hospitalised after I stabbed my own side with a knife, which was extremely dangerous. I have been having CBT sessions and E&R sessions once a week since and I can see an improvement, and I have also been given different medication which is effective. I have managed to get off the knife thing however I kind of still have to hurt myself. That's what my ritual is. I do hate it, who wouldn't?

"Hello I'm Michael, I am 13 years young and from England. I have made an introduction about my story so far which you can read here:
It all started in 2008 when I was in Year 5 of my school. I was young, energetic and loved the outdoors. Until I started to act funny, my parents noticed my strange behavior but thought nothing of it until my hands started to get raw like I'd been burnt. They asked me why my hands looked like this, I told them I was washing my hands. They took my to a doctor and they suggested I go to this house which deals with these kinds of problems.

After a long wait they concluded I had Anxiety and O.C.D, I obviously being my age didn't understand. I started to stop going out as much, I had friends I just didn't have that motivation I had a few months earlier. I hadn't been given any support when I was going through a tough time. I lost all my confidence, socialization and ability, this was going to affect me later in my life.

Two years later I moved into my new school, this is where the biggest problems started. After moving I was really afraid of my new school as there would be more pupils and people I've never seen. I was fine after I settled in, made a new gang of friends, everything was going good but then I was struck by a new problem that was caused by my O.C.D. I started to think my school was seriously dirty and had germs everywhere I went. When I came home from school one day, instead of just sitting down I went up-stairs and took a shower and chucked my school clothes into the washing basket. I started to stop touching stuff I had touched with my school uniform before this had happened (Door handles etc.) , I started to not finish homework or write up sanctions I had been given. Again my parents noticed this strange behavior and I went back to the """"""""Mental house"""""""" to have another diagnoses and they decided I needed to start something called cognitive therapy, basically what I had to do was touch everything I wouldn't choose to (Xbox etc.) while I had my school clothes on. I done this for a week or so but then it became too much. I was then taken back and this time they said they would put me in a social building where they would assess my behavior. We done activities etc. to see how my brain worked and how creative I was. They couldn't find anything apart from the O.C.D and Anxiety I already had. I started to stay in the house almost all day, never went out even with my family. Then they decided I had depression. They put me on medication which I am still on to this day, the medication I felt, didn't really have an effect because my condition was deteriorating.

One year on. I returned to the house and they had found my """"""""Mystery"""""""" illness. It was Autism Spectrum Disorder. I again didn't have a clue what this meant but it didn't sound good. I started to do rituals, have communication problems such as eye contact. Just progressively getting worse and worse.

One year down the line to this present day I have never been worse. I have started washing my hands up to 50 times a day. I have difficulty sleeping and the last time I went out with my friends was almost a year ago. I have lost my relationship with my father. We used to play football, go mountain biking, pretty much do everything together but now he won't even speak to me. My brother and mother are the two who care about me the most and I thank them a ton for being there for me but I don't think I have much hope left. I think it's too late for me to put an end to this. I have considered suicide as an option, but that is the easy way out. My family has considered sending me to a mental hospital because they just cannot cope with me anymore. All I can do is wait and be lucky.

"Hi,
I am 17 years old and have suffered from anxiety for a long time and am constantly worried about just about everything and anything eg. someone breaking into my house, travelling abroad. Sometimes that this anxiety gets so much that I end up breaking down and has meant in the past that I have struggled to sleep and have got very upset at sixth form. As well as this I feel the need for things to be done in a particular way and get very upset when things are out of my normal routine.
I also have horrible thoughts about members of my family dying and the need to (usually just before I am about to go to sleep) make a detailed plan of what I would do in each situation. This is something that I struggle to avoid doing despite the fact that it really upsets me.
I haven't really talked to anyone about this before, however it has been suggested quite a while ago that I maybe should talk to the college counseller, but this just makes me more anxious!

"This is sooo OCD, but I CAN NOT SHAKE OFF THE FEELING.
Last night I was reading my book. It is about sexual abuse. It is a good book about a girl who went threw hell with her dad and is based on a true story. I skipped some pages as I was afraid to get a tingle down there and it just was too much.
I put the book away to sleep and then I started thinking, I enjoy reading this dont I? Its my way to get off instead of porn. I didnt panick and just ignored my thought and said OCD. I then realized a wetness down there and I started wondering if I was wet because I was horny or if it was normal goo from the vagina (sorry!).
I laid in bed and felt I wanted to masterbate, but I didnt as I was afraid that meant the book made me horny so I went to bed. When I woke up this morning I felt really weird. I am unsure if I had a wetdream (if I did it HAS to be because I was horny from the book??!)or if I woke up in the middle of the night wanting to masterbate but didnt cuz I was scared....

"Hi, I am 30 years old and have had OCD most of my life. I have reached the point where I really need help because it is debilitating my life. My thoughts and rituals mostly seem to revolve around fears of death, illness loved ones dying and myself. A lot of this is at night before I go to sleep. 
Anything can trigger it such as not stopping my book on a page that is the same age as a relative as they could die. Not being able to look in the mirror before I go to bed in case that’s the last time I see myself. Not being able to turn off the lights at a time on my phone that matches a terrible event or someone’s age. Having to check everything in the house having to touch nearly everything I come across evenly on both sides a certain amount of times and doing it again if it’s slightly out of time or not even. There’s also a thing with lights and how I have to have a light on for a certain amou tof time. When I go swimming I can only swim certain lengths that are safe numbers and not to do with illness or death.
I could go on and on about everything I do there is so much but it’s realy taking over my life constantly. It doesn’t stop me doing my job or driving my car but it’s this constant anxiety I can’t rid. I have had counselling spoken to people for advice but people always shake it off and say how everyone is OCD and to just stop doing it but I can’t.
I wondered if anyone has similar anxiety to me and do similar things I’ve never read of anyone doing what I do and would love to feel I am not suffering alone.","['Thought', 'Rituals', 'fear', 'OCD', 'anxiety', 'anxiety']",1,1,0,0,0,0.0,"['ritual', 'thought']","['rituals', 'ocd', 'fear', 'thought', 'anxiety', 'ritual']",,

"Hi, My name is Sophie.
I'm 18, female, English and have not been 'properly' diagnosed with OCD. Since I have never been fully diagnosed, besides my ADHD Dr writing """"""""OCD?"""""""" on my report, I have been in denial. I kinda knew I was a 'little OCD', I would joke about it, but its starting to really affect the quality of my life. Perhaps I am just realising to what extent it really affects my life?
I went to my GP weeks ago and they did nothing, going again on monday.
My symptoms are;
What I would call serious skin picking problem. On my legs, my bikini line, my sholders, my arms, my face & my chest. Its so upsetting for me, being an 18 year old girl with 'good skin', I feel like I'm ruining myself. This lowers my self esteem. I go through phases, hardly any skin picking then a huge binge. I feel as if my skin is oily, even if it isn't. This triggers picking. I have even given myself impetigo a few times. I'm so ashamed of my self-induced horrible skin!
Compulsive list writing, this has gotten better but still quite bad. Can spend hours doing this. At one point two years ago my bedroom almost had no floor space due to my ripping out papers because the writing on the list was not good enough. The letters all have to match, be beautiful, no spelling mistakes, which is insane since I am VERY dyslexic.
Organisation is akward for me, going back and forth from ADHD and OCD is tricky, meds help but I think sometimes they make my OCD worse. Things have to be colour coded, untampered with, kept in place, I have to think through where everything goes. Planning pen pots, desk organisation, folder binders.
Most importantly is fears. This affects me the most, Skin picking is second. This is why I am up at 2.50am in the morning writing on this forum. I get fears, illogical fears. It ebs and flows.
Aliens is one I have gotten more recently, not even sure what I am scared of about them (if they even exist?) but it makes it hard for me to sleep, I feel 'unsafe'.
I was in a minor car crash with my boyfriend, since then I have a fear of being in the car and headlights coming towards me.
Heights, stairs, ceiling caving in, somthing falling on me, falling through ceiling or down stairs...ect,ect.
I hate this so much, I just want to be happy again, I'm sick of being scared. I'm crying writing this, I didn't expect to get so emotional. I was always scared of stairs, falling and heights, however these new fears are ruining my life. Sometimes I can talk myself out of them but the feeling is so overwhelming its hard to take control.
What lowers my selfesteem more than anything is the feeling of going/being insane. Not seeming to have control of my actions, getting in my own way. I'm otherwise a very happy person, albeit a little tightly strung.

Its been a while since ive been on the boards - what a great new look for the forum! I have had my 1st CBT session today which i have been waiting anxiously for for about 6 months. My therapist is lovely but i am worried about what sort of things he will help my confront- i have a big fear of physically harming people close to me who i love very much. He made a joke about having me sit with a big knife next to me while talking to him in the sessions and being around the people i am scared of harming do you think hes serious? I think i would have a nervous breakdown! I know its like exposure therapy but i am sooooo scared of getting worse and back to way i was last year. Do you guys who have had CBT think that you have to get worse before you get better? I have developed so many safety mechanisms around myself to cope with this illness which are all gonna get broken down - surely i will get worse? Anyways would appreciate any replys as i am panicking about the next one already!

"Hi Everyone,
This is my first post,
I’m going to my first consultation with a private counselor on Thursday. I have been added to the NHS waiting list about 2 weeks ago, at the same time I finally gave in and have started to take citalopram 10mg. It’s been very hard to accept what that I may actually have a neurological condition - but now I have seemed to have forced myself into accepting it. I have decided that 6 months is too long to wait on an NHS waiting list for CBT; something that I think is probably going to help me recover most effectively. So have taken the plunge and I am going to pay for these sessions privately and attack OCD on 2 fronts.
Obviously this is going to cost me fortune, so I am conscious that I want to get the most of my sessions. I was just looking for advice on how best to enter into these sessions in regards to what to say etc etc etc as I have never been to anything like this before.
In regards to my OCD now I know what it is (mainly to this website and all your great post's) I believe I have had it all of my life. When I think back to any point in my life when I have been truly unhappy it has been down to obsessive internal worrying over illness or horrid thoughts that have gone through my head. I have always managed to get over these, ring fence them and move on.
About 10 months ago I was in a job that I was under a lot of pressure in, working stupid hours and was probably unhappy for the first time in my life for a warranted reason. This brought on a lot of stress and I think this kicked off OCD (is this possible?). I Began to get obsessive thoughts about driving my car into another coming in the other direction, this distressed me to the point where I convinced myself I was suicidal - which quite frankly disgusted me!
Then came the OCD onslaught about suicide, convinced I had depression, convinced I was an alcoholic, self harm in particular regard to sharp knives, hurting others with sharp knives, horrendous vivid images of girls being harmed / mutilated, jumping in front of cars / trains and finally the icing on the cake gay fears OCD. This being what is really affecting me at the minute. The last 6-8 months has been a roller coaster from hell but somehow I am getting there and I’m still kicking :-)
As this is my first post, I would really appreciate a perspective around this. I love cooking it’s a passion and I’ve found it hard to do at points due the OCD around sharp knives. Even now I feel I am beating that strand of OCD, there is def an anxiety scar there. This is similar with the moving object OCD with the notion of me wanting to throw myself in front of things. I walk past moving cars every day and get the train to work, and love driving there is also an anxiety scar with all of these even though they are no longer as prevalent. The OCD about wanting to drive your car into on coming cars has left me not knowing if I will ever be able to drive again or at least an anxiety around it this truly worries and upsets me. Finally, the gay fears OCD that I’m currently going through. I find my mind constantly checking out other blokes even though I know his is ridiculous, but it bothers me to the point of despair and I fel its affecting my libido massively – very mixed up. I love going to the gym - lots of other naked men around obviously this makes this activity sometimes extremely stressful.
So there’s 3 passions that I had in my life a year ago; driving / motor bikes, Cooking and going to the gym and it seems these are the things the OCD has gone for. Is this a coincidence or is this what OCD does???????
Now considering all of the above I would really appreciate some advice on how to move forward with the session on Thursday. I am genuinely excited about seeing this fellow and learning how to manage/overcome my OCD and get on with my life
:-)
Hope to hear from you all
Kind Regards

"It's been 2 months since I had thoughts about what if I punched my daughter, and I don't really feel any better. The thoughts for 2 months prior to these were about myself but then the anxiety threw at me one night a thought of what if I hurt my little girl. It has left me in turmoil and no matter what I do I still live with this fear that I will hurt her :-(
Every day is tough, the daytime isn't as bad as the evening, once teatime hits I am anxious and scared to be near her. My head has images of me punching her in the face and fear runs through my body as it feels like it will happen :-( That feeling that it will happen is leaving me in utter turmoil and the reason I am so scared. Thoughts alone are bad but that feeling like it might happen if I go near her is terrible. Is this common? does anyone else feel like this?
I love my daughter so very much, she is 8 and we are so close but the last 2 months have destroyed my relationship with her, I can't be as close to her, or laugh with her like we used to. I can't be alone with her, it really is having a huge impact on my life :-( I have 2 sons that are abit older and the thoughts aren't really about them, they've occasionally hit when near them but very rare.

I have tried to accept them, accept they are a spin off of my anxiety. I had a tough year last year battling anxiety and agoraphobia, I hadn't had OCD before November last year when it suddenly hit me. These last 4 months have been tough but the last 2 months have been the worst as they are about my little girl and I don't want anything bad to happen :-(
The acceptance doesn't help, I am at a loss what to do. I am having ERP/CBT and I have been doing exposure homeworks but we are working up to it slowly, obviously she can't flood me with this just yet as it's high up on my fear hierarchy.We are getting our way up the list though. I have a few things, I removed knives as I had a brief time where i feared sharp objects incase I hurt myself or the children so my psychologist is helping me bring those objects back into the house and making me learn more about my anxiety. It's helping but I am still tortured by this about my little girl every single day and I don't know what to do :-(
I know I have posted before but if anyone could offer me some advice or positive stories I would appreciate it.

I have 2 questions that are haunting me and I really need to know if there is an answer to either of them
1 Is OCD hereditary?
2 Is paranoia part of OCD
My grandmother was always 'odd'. As I grew up I learned from my parents there was something 'not right' about her. She was a very nasty spiteful woman, but she did have habits that were not 'normal', such as wrapping things in brown paper and tying them with string and hiding them. Then getting them all out each morning and undoing them to check if 'they' had touched anything in the night. Then she would re wrap them and hide them again. She did this evey day. she was always talking about 'them' and what 'they' were plotting to do to her. we never did learn who 'they' were. 'People' were always talking about her, saying things behind her back and laughing at her. 'They' would pump gas through the ceiling to put her to sleep so 'they' could come in and do things. She was totally mistrustful of people and never had any friends.
When I was young my father took delight in telling me I was going to be just like my grandmother, which scared the out of me. but I am like her in a lot of ways and I don't want to be. I'd give anything not to be. But if I am, maybe there is a reason and although she was a very selfish, spiteful and nasty woman and I am not (I don't think ) maybe she was ill but it was just never recognised.
Well, if you are still with me after all that i would appreciate as much feedback on this as poss. as I feel as though I might be on the edge of something.
Have a good day :original:

Im normally here saying how well its been going lately but ive had 2 mini blips. One was today and the other was a few days ago.
I know I should be taking the meds but I keep forgetting no matter how hard I try, I should have re-ordered some 2 weeks ago but I havent as I still have some left. My GP has noticed that I keep missing some and tells me how its important I keep to them.

"So I have recognised myself as having OCD 2 weeks ago today and I said I would post a progress update on here as a kind of therapeutic exercise. It has been a difficult couple of weeks with lots of ups and downs but I feel I am definitely making progress. I feel my days are long and my OCD gets the better of me in the evening time when I get tired and my guard drops a little. It takes alot of energy to fight it.
I said last week that I felt I was feeling 50% better but this might have been slightly exaggerating my progress and there have been some set-backs since. I think the key is coping with set backs. I like monitoring my progress but it is difficult to do because I have trouble remembering exactly how I felt last week. Maybe I should focus less on this.
My main points of progress have been.
Attended 2 social events with minimum anxiety which is good progress for me. Definitely better than a month ago when I couldn't even look people in the eye.
Feel more confident and comfortable in work. Feel more confident doing tasks and feel like I can take on more responsibility
Doubts are less pervasive. They are still strong but I am regaining a better sense of reality.
My focus on other things is improving. I am not constantly preoccupied and I can move a little further away from my OCD.

"It may only be September, but we are already receiving emails to ask if we will be producing any charity Christmas Cards this coming festive season, and of course we are!
Purchasing charity OCD-UK Christmas cards not only provides the opportunity for you to financially support the charity, but also in previous seasons we know that many of our members have actually used the cards to gently introduce their family and friends to OCD, a way to come ‘out’ about their OCD in many cases.
We have two new designs for 2009. A more traditional Christmas card scene in ‘Christmas Delivery’ and a more modern look with ‘Frosty the Snowman’.
Christmas Delivery
Frosty the Snowman
Both designs include the seasonal greeting on the inside ‘Best Wishes for Christmas and the New Year’. The cards also include a ‘sold in aid of OCD-UK’ message along with brief charity details. Each pack of Christmas cards are priced at just £3.99 per pack plus postage. Each pack contains ten cards all of the same design, and are made from card derived from sustainable forests.
To order online just click the links above, or visit our online shop by clicking here. If you refer to pay the old fashioned cheque way please use the chat below to work our your postage costs.
For those coming to our conference this year, you can pre order for collection at the conference to save your P+P costs. At £3.99 per pack these are excellent value charity Christmas cards.
Postage:
Unlike other organisations,
we only charge the actual
postage costs incurred by
the charity, so please use
the chart below to calculate
your postage costs:
1 Pack - £0.76
2 or 3 Packs - £1.04
4 to 6 Packs - £2.24
7 to 10 Packs - £2.70
I.e. If you wish to purchase
two packs of cards, then
it will cost £3.99 x 2, plus
£1.04 postage = £9.02 to
pay.","['email', 'OCD']",0,0,0,0,0,0.0,[],"['ocd', 'email']",,
"This financial year-to-date (Dec 1 2009 to Nov 30 2010) the charity's income is about £61,000 so far, with £31,000 coming from our fantastic fund-raisers efforts, and £15,000 coming from our magnificent members. It goes without saying, we value our members support and generosity, and we hope our services offer them a little something back. But as you can see, OCD-UK is totally self sufficient, and reliant on the efforts of you, our members. This year our fundraisers have done an incredible job and therefore I wanted to take a moment to thank them all by name.

We had people go to Paris to fundraise and we had people come from Portugal and Germany to fundraise for us, how amazing is that????
I can't thank our members and fundraisers enough, but what I can say is for every £1 you raised, it helps keep OCD-UK afloat. Without your efforts we would have to close.
2011 will be a tough year for the charity as £17,000 of the income this year came from the London Marathon which we do not have places for in 2011, so we need to somehow get more people involved in the events we do have places for. I am delighted to say that we have signed up our first two fund-raisers for events in 2011 and I have also signed up for two 10K runs as part of my 10x10 challenge.
Once again, I want to thank our members and fundraisers, I feel we all owe the above named a debt of gratitude and thanks. :clapping:","['hope', 'fever', 'wobble', 'OCD']",0,0,0,0,0,0.0,[],"['wobble', 'hope', 'ocd', 'fever']",,
"For some time we have been pondering our plans for our 2010 conference. As our members know, we are the only charity that takes our conference to different parts of the country, in the past Stirling, Bristol, Greenwich, Derby and Bournemouth. We have plans for a different part of the country for 2010, however we have hit a snag in that I think we have too many speakers for a single conference, so we may end up with two!!!! Nice problem to have.
In addition to this, we want to keep things fresh and we have some idea's to try new formats out at this years conference, but also to change the whole ethos of the conference itself, and about why OCD-UK is different, we are a charity for sufferers so the day needs to be much more about us, what we need and want to help us.
That in mind, before I commission our conference plans for 2010 I wanted to ask people what would they like to see or hear at a conference. Maybe you are already 80% better so don't mind, but think back to when you were at your lowest, what did you really need to know about?
Part of the day will be much more about you telling us, the charity what you want and need, this is something many of you do all year round anyway but this will be more of a focus on the day of the conference. We also want to provide much more practical day to day advice in the workshop sessions.
So what else? What else would you like to see or do at the conference? Maybe you have a specific subject you want an expert to discuss, or a specific expert you want to listen to.
We can not promise to meet all your requests, but your feedback will help us shape the conferences, after all this is your day!",['OCD'],1,1,1,0,0,0.0,[],['ocd'],,

As you know, fundraising runs are one of the ways that OCD-UK manages to survive, along with your kind membership donations.

So if anyone thinks they might be interested in running for us in 2012, please do post on here. Don't worry I wont hold you to it yet, I just need to get an idea for how many places I might need to order.

"Since OCD-UK was founded back in 2004, it was our aim to ensure that OCD-UK became a charity for the whole of the UK, a charity serving our nation. It was this belief that promoted us to ensure we hosted our annual conferences around the whole of the UK, in fact, our first ever event was held in Scotland and since then we have hosted conferences on the South Coast, the East of England, the Midlands, the North West and this year we are hosting our annual conference in Wales, Cardiff on Saturday 10th November.
Despite our best efforts, to take our national conference around the whole of the UK, we are only too aware that sometimes, the nature of our OCD it prohibits attendance, or if you live in the opposite part of the country, traveling can be impractical anyway, especially for our overseas members of course! Because of these reasons, many of our community are excluded from our annual conference, and since last year we set about exploring ways we can ensure many more of our community can be involved and included in the day, rather than excluded.
It gives us great pleasure today to be able to announce that this year, through the kind and generous support of Awards for All, part of the National Lottery Fund, the 2012 National OCD Conference will make use of the latest technology available to offer a live webstream broadcast of our 2012 annual conference. This year, the broadcast streaming will be freely available to all, and not only will residents in the UK be able to view the conference, but also visitors from overseas will also be able to benefit from the web streaming too, subject to technical requirements.
We would also like to thank Dr Louise Waddington at Cardiff University for her support and help in facilitating this live streaming of our conference, without her support on the ground in Cardiff, this would not be possible.
The entire conference will be broadcast online, with the possible exception of the Q+A session which will be made available as a recording after the conference. This is to ensure our audience's anonymity can be protected. Full details of how to access the streaming will be made available on our website in the week prior to the conference. All you will need is access to a computer with a good broadband connection and the ability to play Adobe Flash. Users of Apple (iPhone and iPad) devices may need to find access to other devices that can use Adobe Flash. The entire conference will be also be recorded, and made freely available to view for 6 months.
For those that wish to travel to Cardiff, our camera's will only be fixed on the speakers, our audience will not be broadcast to ensure audience anonymity. If you would like to come along on the day, we would recommend it. Our conferences are a great way to listen to, learn from and even ask questions of the some of the leading OCD experts here in the UK, but also to meet others with OCD and share coping experiences, and for some, to make new friends too.
If it's your first time at an OCD conference, then we understand you are likely to be feeling incredibly nervous and wondering whether you should come, even more so if you're traveling alone.  We can assure you that you won't be the only one coming for the first time, and everyone there will be friendly, and understand exactly what you go through with OCD on a daily basis. We will do our very best to make everyone feel welcomed and relaxed.

"Hey everyone.
I've thought about when I should write this and I think now would be a good time!
I wanted to start by saying thank you to OCD UK. This site/forum came to me at a time this year when things for me were at the absolute worst, and this excellent resource kicked off a period of 4 months this year where I have learnt more about myself than I ever have before.
August 22nd for me was a life changing day. I thought I was crazy, that my thoughts related to violence were going to make me someone I wasn't. I honestly thought I was going to be hospitalised. It was only after a scary talk I had with my mum, that my family found this site, and everything that had caused me massive anxiety over the past 3 years of my life seemed to make sense. 
Last Christmas, I had a real nasty time with OCD thoughts I didn't even know could be OCD. I was ill, afraid; and out of much hope for the future.
2016 has been the year I turned 18, and it would be an understatement to say this year has been a rollercoaster!
1. I've spoken in Parliament on national television.
2. I've had many breakdowns about my future and how I'd ever cope with growing with so much anxiety.
3. I passed all my A-Levels!  
4. I've begun to accept that I may always life with anxiety, but that doesn't have to affect me as a person!
5. I've shared so many stories with people across the country, and I've worked to improve Mental Health provision in local schools.
6. I chose not to go to university. The pressure to go was immense, and I piled so much on myself, trying to hard to be the perfect student. I felt as if this was a decision the school was forcing everyone to do, without really showing other alternatives! This has been one of my toughest ever challenges.
7. I've got a full time job at my old school, helping kids with learning disabilities! This has helped my confidence so much. And on a side note I learned that doing an apprenticeship in bar work wasn't for me!
Sorry if this has become a bit of a long post, and I definitely don't want to come off as one of those """"""""My life is so much better than yours."""""""" kind of people. I just hope this little bit about myself might show that OCD and Anxiety might feel like an endless tunnel, with no easy exit or detour; but you can keep going and sometimes it can really hide how much progress you can make in life.
So again, I wanted to say a massive thank you to this forum and everyone who works with OCD UK and all the contributors that give up their time to help other people. Any post and share of our experiences is a testament to how strong people with Anxiety Disorders truly are.
Have a great Christmas everyone, and I hope you have a happy new year!

"Happy New Year to everyone on here.  These are a few things I'm planning to do to give my mental health the best chance in 2018:
- get more sleep by getting to bed at 10:30pm and not googling on the phone in bed
- getting up at the same time every day. I can do this. This is the best way to recalibrate circadian rhythms 
- I have an appointment with my GP to discuss mental health, OCD and work life balance and have a think about what I need to let my employer know to help maintain my health and be productive. It's time to accept this condition. This will be an exposure in itself
- get CBT from babcp qualified therapist and if not, then bacp to help with confidence issues. I think this will help me fight OCD better and help with relationships in my life, particularly family.
-Read Ruby Wax's 'Frazzled' and practice mindfulness at work
- join yoga class
- continue gym membership. Hopefully confidence building with therapist will help counteract negative thoughts about my body at the gym. 
-try sort the trichotillomania although it has been impossible to date. This will be further down the list.

"Hi. I have had ocd since I was a very small kid. When I turned in my 20 it went highwire. I have started therapy, and no the person is not an ocd specialist as we don't have one in my area. But she has done a good job
Yesterday I was on here telling everyone about an incident with my BF at a party at our friends house in the garden. Our friends sisters where out playing in the garden guess the dad thought it was ok. We played and messed with them. But then we all started to get tipsey and drunk.
As a joke my boyfriend took out his dick and showed it to his friends and me. We laughed but then I realized kids could maybe see it. So he put it back in.
Thing is having ocd, my BF has told me that the kids were inside at the time as he remembers they went in. But we will never know and I dont remember kids being there when it happend but I was tipsey too. Is my bf a bad person for showing his dick as a joke to us and not caring about the kids being around? I love my BF and I dont want to leave him. I really dont, I love him so much and we are on the verge of getting engaged. He did say if kids saw his dick that means he was very inapropriate and said sorry, but he tells me he can garentee that they didnt see

"I've been a long term (decades) sufferer of OCD in various forms, centered around the traditional checking/contamination OCD. I was properly diagnosed 5-6 years ago (along with depression) and at the time prescribed Citalopram (I am no longer on that) and eventually a course of CBT at the Maudsley. These were, at the time relatively successful, in that they took me from a completely non-functional human being into being someone who can lead a comparitively normal life, with the exception that I consume rather more anti-bacterial products than everyone else, and one aspect which we never solved which I'll get to in a bit.
I suffer from:
1) Checking. Not just doors and windows (I must put on a pretty entertaining show for the neighbours when I leave the house), but things like forms (I find any kind of official documentation e.g. tax forms incredibly stressful). I have always suffered from this for as long as I can remember.
2) Contamination. I really didn't suffer from this at all, until at the start of my PhD I moved to London. Something about the closeness of people. The ever present smell of urine. The grubbiness of everything and an over-active imagination set me off and I started a steady decline which caused the eventual collapse that caused me to seek professional help. This was really helped by the CBT. I can't emphasise how greatful I am to the staff at the Maudsley. I can now touch my trousers below the knee without having a panic attack. I have used public restrooms. I get an immeasurably small fraction better every day.
3) Computer security. This is where it gets weird, and I suspect my therapist, though skilled was rather stumped. I suffer from a weird... mutation of contamination OCD which is broadly similar in most respects to contamination OCD, except that instead of biological contamination (for want of a better word) it focuses on the fear that electronic devices I am using have been compromised (hackers, viruses) and that I'm not been careful enough to stop it and something terrible and unspecified will happen. This results in a ridiculous amount of checking (checking TLS certificates on sites, running Antivirus, keeping an eye on process lists and so on), avoidance (I have various devices split into different categories from """"""""only for very secure things"""""""" to """"""""mucking about on the Internet"""""""" and NEVER SHALL THESE THINGS BE MIXED), terror and panic attacks when I notice something that looks wrong or unusual. I obsessively comb sites that post security notices and worry about the packages on my machines. I worry about updates or the lack thereof.
I even found it somewhat stressful registering for this site as a result (which email to use, https: is not used everywhere on the site etc.).
This built up over the same time-frame as the contamination OCD, but from an earlier start. And therapy didn't help, partly because due to my employment/training I have a fairly good technical understanding of these problems, a lot more so than the people attempting to help me, certainly. I try to apply the same techniques that worked with biological contamination but with limited success.
I have got slightly better. Over the time before I sought treatment, I progressively pulled back from the Internet. I stopped playing online games. Stopped blogging, talking to people. I never managed to shop online (too risky) and I cancelled all my online banking. Since treatment I've opened up again. I blog. I tweet. I play MMOs. I even (and this is still amazing to me) manage to shop online although so far this is exclusively through services I am certain I trust (Steam, Amazon).
But this is still the aspect of OCD that I struggle with most, and it's why I signed up in the hope that I might find other people who struggle with this.
I still suffer from anxiety attacks brought on by things that happen. Heartbleed nearly killed me. I work in IT and am unfortunately constantly exposed to news about security holes in this or that, or websites that have been hacked and this frequently results in panics and what I refer to as the chain of panic attacks - namely, that while checking problem A, I'll notice something else, a new problem, problem B and while checking that I'll find C and so on getting progressively more worked up until I collapse.
I'm really struggling, I guess to find the balance between an """"""""appropriate level"""""""" of security awareness/concern, and that caused by my OCD.
I'm typing this because I'm in the latter exhaustion stages of a cycle of this caused by finding out a thing about a site I use being hacked yesterday, which has progress through series of password resets, antivirus, and Firefox updates, culminating in me deciding that everyone who uses the same operating systerm I do has a (objectively very very small) security issue to worry about. But in my mind it's not very very small. It's disastrous and everyone is doomed.
And honestly typing this all out has already made me feel a bit better.
So I guess I'm asking, do other people suffer from this here? How do you cope? Or are there any medical people with the more normal contamination OCD on here who can suggest strategies that they use to cope with the knowledge/triggers that their employment constantly provides them with that I might adapt?","['depression', 'fear', 'email', 'talking', 'hope', 'anxiety', 'anxiety', 'exhaustion', 'object', 'Treatment', 'checking', 'site', 'OCD', 'process']",0,0,0,0,0,0.0,['obsessive'],"['exhaustion', 'ocd', 'email', 'fear', 'treatment', 'talking', 'checking', 'depression', 'obsessive', 'site', 'anxiety', 'hope', 'process', 'object']",,

Hi everyone,
Sorry for the long message. I am new at this. Hope you bear with me!I really need your advice.
I am a 23 old girl from Sweden who's had OCD for a large part of my life but the last 2 years it has become out of control. I can no longer do a single thing without having to do it several times and the thoughts (mostly having to do with fear about death) are so intrusive that they come every 10 seconds which means I really feel my life is not worth living like this, all ability to be happy is gone and filled with despair and fear that something might happen if I don't follow the thoughts and actions my mind tells me to. However it is no longer enough to do an action 1 or 2 times as before, even if I do it 5 times I still cannot feel calm and feel something is going to happen which stays with me throughout the whole day until I later go and do that action again. I can no longer live like this!
After much stress and a finished BSc I am now moving to the UK for an internship and since I discovered this website I feel better about finding some help in the UK.
Therefore I would like to ask you, how could I get in touch with a psychologist and how much does it usually cost? I have been prescribed medication (Seroxat) but have been too afraid of taking it because I read how bad it could be for suicidal thoughts and I know cognitive therapy should be combined with medication for optimal result. I don't know what to do or where to start, I just want to be free!
Thank you so much!

Hi!
Firstly, im 20 now and my ocd went out of controll about 4 months...
So same here but my OCD is about bad wishes to my beloved brother. And I've got this thoughts every minutes im my head...
It is really like im evil... really... and i don't know who i am. My other """"""""good"""""""" part of my mind know that i can't be evil, i love my brother... i don't want these all, he does not deserve this...
And it's related with God, Gods etc.... and i fear that they will punish my brother because of my negative toughts about them... or because of my wishes...
Than i get this punishing thing in my mind... and then i """"""""pray"""""""" just to do that thing to me, not with him... :S
And I hopless...
I got anafranil and rivotril, and my doctor said that they will make me normal, and when i don't have these thoughts any more, i got to go ctb.","['hope', 'despair', 'site', 'Suicidal', 'Medication', 'OCD', 'fear', 'Suicidal thoughts', 'Thought']",1,1,1,1,1,0.0,"['thought', 'intrusive']","['ocd', 'fear', 'medication', 'despair', 'site', 'thought', 'intrusive', 'suicidal thoughts', 'hope']",,
"Hi Everyone
To all the those people with Pure O do you feel that the thoughts are urges are with you 24 hours a day, (well maybe when your not asleep). I go about my day and have these thoughts and urges constantly in my head and at times I feel the panic rising in me and then it calms down. Maybe for minutes now and again the thoughts subside and go into the background and then suddenly out of the blue they can come back and me feel all panicky.
The thoughts I have at the moment are about my boyfriends little girl that I want to abuse her and then if I did that I would kill myself. The thought goes on and on and on and on. It feels like I am going about my everyday normal life and I have this snake following me constantly around.
I did start taking Omega 3 capsules (solgar version) and for a few days the thoughts completely subsided and I felt on top of the world and then bang back again. I take 1 capsule three times a day - maybe I should be taking a higher dose. Does anyone else take Omega 3 and what dosage do ye take?
Thank you.

"Hi,
My name is Jenny and I am new to this forum. I am 25 and have lived with OCD for the last 10 years but recently it has become worse. I have been to CBT therapy twice, 10 weeks each with the NHS but it was not enough because after I finished it I realized I can't cope on my own and fell back into it.
Now I feel trapped in my home, I can never feel any good emotions because I am constantly filled with worry that something bad might happen to my family if I move a book or write down something in my diary without repeating it to neautralise when I get this bad thought. This has come to a place where I cannot do ANY everyday activity or action- even picking up a book from my bookshelf without getting a terrible thought and having to neutralise. If I try to resist it I get so incredibly anxious that I can't handle it.
At work I constantly have to rewrite sentences and get very slowed down. The worst thing is now i am in my room and I feel like all my things and everything around me is bringing me bad luck. I can't do anything with these things without feeling bad. I can't even make it cosy around me without getting such terrible feelings. I can't express in words what I am going through. The last 3 months it has gotten so bad that I have lost meaning in my life, I feel very sad and have no hope. I cry very often and feel stuck in my life and have no idea what to do or where to go. I have asked to be referred for therapy but it is taking a while. I have been put back on antidepressants (escitalopram- because fluoxetine didn't help).
I have no idea what to do anymore so I would like to ask you- is it possible to overcome OCD? Please share your experiences, I need hope. Is it possible to get help from books? Or is it only therapy? What is the best solution?

"This is edited version of an article written by By Sara H for December 2005 newsletter
A lecture presented in September by Lord Layard at the Sainsbury Centre for Mental Health in London highlighted important issues needing to be addressed by the Health Service, and introduced a new initiative to increase mental health services in the UK.
To resolve the problems of lack of resources and staff, Lord Layard suggested a major programme to train new therapists – up to 10,000. The emphasis is on quality, in terms of training and in terms of treatment, in order for this programme to be successful. Main points raised in the lecture include the need for patients to be treated near to where they live - preferably on GP premises - , effective supervision and management of therapists and offering professional advancement based on work excellence.
What makes this programme different is that instead of referrals from Gps, therapies will be delivered through treatment centres, which would firstly be useful for patients who do not want to go to their GP. In addition, therapists would be monitored to ensure quality of treatment, and the centres would be focused on providing in-house training and professional development. Centres would concentrate on CBT and be separate from CMHTs, these dealing with more seriously ill patients. All these aspects would contribute to a nationwide dedication to mental health services.
Looking ahead five years, it is estimated by Lord Layard that there would be one treatment centre per quarter million of the population, that is 250 centres in total. In addition to treating patients in the centre, most staff would spend some time at local GP surgeries.
It is stressed that there must be a long-term plan for these centres and treatment for mental health, in order that 'dumbing down' does not occur, as it can do with major initiatives. Centres should be set up gradually, with the first centres being educational and providing useful information for improvement and expansion.","['urge', 'quality', 'Treatment']",0,0,0,0,0,0.0,[],"['quality', 'urge', 'treatment']",,
"Tomorrow I have my second visit to the psychotherapist, but I am worrying about it. On my first visit I took a note book with a list of all my problems. My therapist wanted me to read them out loud, but I couldnt so she read them herself. At the end of my session she asked if I could keep a log of my thoughts and moods. This isnt something I like doing (writing about myself), but I written things down since the appointment.
I am worried that tomorrow she will ask me to read them out aloud. I really dont want to do this. What will she do if I cant do it. Will she just sit there waiting for me to speak. I have also written down about my self harm, which I am not proud of either. I dont know what I am supposed to say when I see her. When I talk to people I dont know I seem to block out any emotional feelings. I become a yes/no person when answering questions. There were many occassions last time where she was just looking at me and niether of us said anything.
I am just worried about tomorrow. Also will my therapist talk to my gp about things I have written, especially about the self-harm. I would feel like I have let my gp down and would find it difficult to see her if she knew.

"Hi
I've just had 3 good days, managed to dismiss thoughts and felt so much better. But this morning I was dreaming about a friend who is having a baby and then I half woke up and for some reason my attention was drawn to my mouth and I suddenly got this horrific intrusive thought go through my head, it was like 'I'm going to...' Accompanied by a vague image. I won't even write is because it's disgusting. I'm in knots, how could I think such a thing? It's so vile. And I was innocently dreaming about my friend who is having a baby. How could my mind generate such a thought. I feel sick. As soon as the thought comes in I'm like oh my god that is horrific and start panicking about it. Is OCD really capable of causing such thoughts? I feel so terrible for these thoughts. It's the last thing in the world I ever want to think about. It shouldn't be thought about. It's wrong. It's the opposite to who I am.

"Hi everyone,
Since my relapse in Nov last year (first in four years) i feel like i have been through three stages.
Stage 1 - Total panic and breakdown. Why is this happening to me? Could i really be a bad person? Questioning all those thoughts that i swore i would never give into again. I could'nt sleep, eat or function. Wanted to curl up in a ball and die. Desperation and crying out for help. So many questions. How could this happen to me when i have had ocd since a child? Surely i should know the drill by now? The scary ability of not being able to think straight and see sense.
Stage 2 - Overdrive. I must and will beat OCd for the sake of my children and family. Duracell Bunny mode as my therapist called it. Everything was done in fast forward and stressed to the nines. Trying to cure myself but not having the patience to wait. The overbearing need to beat OCD once and for all so as not to cause others pain. The guilt felt for not being myself and strong for my children.
Stage 3 - Fed up. Burn out. No motivation, Isolation, Feel no one to turn to. The burden of putting on a front to friends and family so they do not worry but feeling so alone. Depressed and feeling sorry for myself.
Can anyone relate to this? How do i pull myself out of this 3rd stage and get the motivation back.

I am doing much, much better these days, I feel I've made really good progress, but as the title suggests, I seem to get dragged back every so often.

Now I can't remember if I did it, or pulled the bag up just in time. It was years ago and I do remember thinking at the time that I shouldn't worry because my shrink had told me that using a bag wasn't molesting or a crime (this is because there was incidents before this one on the train that had sparked off the OCD)

I had been coping well before becoming pregnant but now I feel i am once again trapped in hell with my pocd, but then it does switch from time to time but always comes back to this.
I am under perinatal psychiatric team and the nurse comes to see me every week, my old cbt therapist wouldnt pick up treatment with me untill baby is 6months old.
I have been getting slowly worse each week and the perinatal nurse has now told me to take 25mg of imipramine in a morning, i really didnt want to take anything but as i was going on I would be too mentally exhausted to take care of baby and face birth. They want me to go upto 25mg two times a day as they say this is the treatment dose then lower back down to 25mg before hes born.
I am taking the 25mg but cant bring myself to take the second dose i feel like i am hurting him, but I have hit rock bottom once again, cannot stop crying and the thoughts,groinal response, anxiety and hormones are just pulling me to pieces. I cant talk to anyone on the phone without bursting into tears and i cant get out of bed most days due to low mood.

"So im in my 39th year
What OCD has done is take away my ability to make decisions. I used to be someone who had a grasp on normality.
I had good friends at school, i went to university, I worked and had fun. The OCD was there but not so strong that I could not function.
I have spent time in the Priory when I really found out what OCD was and spent time at a day hospital.
I have so far been on orlanzapine,zopiclone,seroxat,anafranil,sertraline, tamazepam, effexor to name a few. None have really worked and some of my worst times have been on them.
I'm on nothing now, no job for the last 7 years, in the 7 years I have tried to keep busy with projects and the like but none have made any money, I've designed large modular cycle sheds for schools and tried to start an exhaust business but the supply and demand was not there, what I'm saying is I have not sat on my ass.
I live at my parents and have a gf who comes back at weekends. My OCD now just overflows me and I go from one point of despair to the next.
What is the answer? The jobcentre sent me to a place that can help people with """"""""basic literacy and numeracy!!!"""""""" FFS I've been to university, I need time to get my confidence and not go to a place where they teach GCSEs and help people with domestic violence and drugs!! do they not understand OCD!! Does anyone else have experience of being treated right at the jobcentre with this new Incapacity Benefit? I do want to work but don't want to tell them that until im ready and not have them push me into a scarey work programme to tick one of their boxes.
The point I'm at is that I see contamination in everything, I am reluctant to go out, when I do go out it feels false, I worry im not right for my gf. Every morning I feel very low and have OCD worries like playing cards in my mind. I get up and feel a bit better.

"Hi All
I went to see my therapist as I had CBT last year and it ended abruptly due to the therapist being off ill. I basically in that time only added little bits onto my rituals which wasnt too bad so I asked Gp to refer me again and she did so this guy I have seen today for the 3rd time he is trying to get me back to where I was when the therapy ended last year where I had nailed most of my rituals on the head and I was feeling confident in myself that I was getting somewhere.
I had seen him two weeks ago and I was going to work on shortening a couple of my bathroom rituals but ive been due on my period and in pain all last week and im on it now and very heavy today with headache dizziness etc the usual stuff. I saw him today and explained that last week when I was in my partners car I felt a floaty kinda feeling and this made me panic in my head almost like I wasnt grounded and felt like I was completely out of control now I know this is a control thing as I dont drive and I get bored on long journeys and as I dont like to read or take my eyes off the road either I do get a bit fidgety and bored and my brain starts to run away with itself. I also talked about the fact that I eat rubbish like chocolate in large quantities and feel like I have a hangover the following morning and I start the self talk the running myself down self talk such as you will never lose weight, look at you so fat might as well keep eating loads of rubbish anyway etc etc and he said it could also be a boredom thing too as Im not in a routine meaning I get up late my day starts late and I feel anxious really before the day starts.
So the first thing is to get myself into a regular bedtime and getting up time that way I have more of the day and I will be less likely to be tempted to eat rubbish late at night and I will be more organised with the kids too and a happier person and as for my weight to make small changes now before I join the slimming world club when the kids go back to school such as start to buy more healthier foods and slowly start eating in that way and its less of a shock to my system plus I will feel more in control instead of saying to myself which I do now well ive got 3 weeks before I join might as well eat loads of rubbish in the meantime.
He also said that OCD like many things is our way of dealing with anxieties and our way of getting attention though to start with I took it the wrong way as I thought he was meaning that I was basically sitting there because I want attention and OCD is my way of getting it so I got upset cos I was thinking does this mean I made it all up like a child whos having a tantrum and I dont really have OCD at all. I explained it to my partner who said like many things and mental health problems its our bodies and minds ways of telling us there is something wrong and in that way it is getting attention if that makes sense.
Does anyone else have any thoughts of how this went today? In one sense this guys approach is to tell me things even though I may not want to hear them but hes putting it to me straight and in that way it feels like he isnt pussy footing around me and making me see it for what it is thats my take on it anyway.

I live in Germany and have been suffering from OCD for many years. Now I'm 43 and I think I have got OCD since I was 6 or 7. During these years my OCD topics have changed. I say that I have a certain (problem) slot in my brain which is always occupied with one or two issues and then they get replaced by other ones. The old issues are almost of no concern anymore.

Actually, I haven't had a specific therapy to address my OCD. Recently I came across the 4 Steps Method by Jeffery Schwartz. The German translation didn't receive too many good comments, though I consider this methode interesting and I'm trying to implement it in my daily life.

I am aplying the 4 steps into my treatment, and it seems to be the most helpful technique that I have used. But here is my question. I have intrusive violent thoughts towards myself or towards others. When I get them, my natural response would be to try to assure myself, that it will never happen. But that doesn't work, because I can't really 100% be shure that its just a thought, so this is just keeping the cycle to continue on and on. So that is probably my mental compuslive reaction to the thoughts. So when I stop doing that, and knowing that these thoughts are just OCD thoughts, caused by my wrong brain function, its important to refocuse to another activity, and even thoe the thoughts are still there, I am that way changig my response to the OCD thoughts.

"Our kid rang me up tonight and asked if I wanted to play 5 a side football, I willingly agreed as this week - I have finally got into """"""""health - kick"""""""" mode, walking miles each day an' that. So, we kicked off at 9 pm and played for an hour, I had an OK game (once I decided to start running about) - took a while to get off the mark in terms of scoring.
First goal, was a nifty little combination of control and a swift turn before a good shot curling the ball round the keeper to land in the far corner, then rattled the post with a screamer of a volley, came very close with a Riise style left footed missile - either hit the post or was saved, before finally getting my head behind a deep cross and beating the keeper wit the only headed goal of the game.
However.....I get very aggressive in tackles. The OCD is behind every single one saying I'm trying to foul (I am) in order to cause some serious damage and even death to the opponent. Then the guilt plays on my mind, but eventually I am able to brush it off. Some lad tripped my brother and sent him tumbling when he was about to fire one in....
So I see red and waited for this lad to get the ball, and when the chance came - two footed tackle. Oops. But, I'm not gonna feel guilty about that. Its just the other stuff I felt guilty about.

"Ill just tell you guys my story and see if any of you can help or advise or just support me.
Since i was about 16 i had OCD, as a child i was outgoing and didnt have any worries.
When i was about 16 i developed 2 kinds of OCD, one is what i call """"""""justifiable"""""""", the other is """"""""unjustifiable"""""""", in my own head.
An example of unjustifiable OCD, is when i was walking down a road, if i had a bad thought in my head when i took a step such as i had forgotten to do something really important when really, i knew for sure that i had done it and did not forget,i would have to walk back to the exact step that thought crossed my mind and i would have to say in my own head, no, i didnt forget, i know i didnt forget.
Sooner or later i battled this OCD by simply not giving into it, as i saw that by going and standing in that spot and saying something isnt going to happen wont change anything. This was the same for other """"""""unjustifiable"""""""" OCD's such as making sure the tv volume is on an even number, i knew it changed nothing, so i managed to battle the OCD.
However, once i had beaten that OCD, the other took over
my """"""""other"""""""" OCD is what in my head i see as justifiable,
for example, i know there is a very small risk of getting infections such as atheletes foot or herpes from gym equipment if somebody had shaved there or had an open cut, and i touched this infected area and then touched my mouth or eye for example, so if after the gym if i withought thinking touched my eye or ate something before washing my hands, i would then have a small anxiety attack over if i was going to contract herpes from the gym equipment.
The main anxiety comes when i get home from the gym and i spent hours researching how herpes could be transferred from someone else to me from a gym setting in order to convince myself 100% whether i thought it had happened to me or not.
I consider this OCD example as different to my first one because i see it as """"""""justifiable"""""""" in the fact that there is a chance of it happening, it may be a one in a million chance but it has happened to people before and it could therefore happen to me.
This really limits my life and i am constantly jumping at shadows of possible infections i could get from different things.
I can not just be happy go lucky and forget about the 0.001% risk i am facing when i go to the gym, in my head it seems more 50-50.
I have completely got rid of what i call unjustifiable OCD,but when there is a 0.001% chance of something bad happening, i.e a """"""""justifiable"""""""" worry my mind gets really anxious.
I try and battle it but in my head i think, it could actually have happened, and therefore i find it impossible to forget about and also find it hard to see how any treatment could help me stop thinking about a risk that is actually there. I wish i could just not worry about it at all.
Thanks for taking the time to read and hopefully reply.

I read some info on 5HTP, thought I'd give it a go, and after a month I can say that it has turned things around for me.
I know it may not work for everyone, and I must stress that you shouldnt take it with any prescribed medication, and also that's its probably worth seeing your GP about it, but on top of all of that, I think its bl00dy great :clapping:

I have just read a book by a US psychiatrist who's not too keen on some of the prescription drugs used for anxiety disorders..while he admits that in many cases they prove really helpful he also thinks that sometimes natural remedies can be just as effective, minus the side effect ( nothing new here I'm sure)
In cases of OCD he recommends 5HTP tablets, I know they were mentioned in the newsletter, I bought some yesterday cos they were on offer at Hollands and Barretts, but I'm not sure now...
I know the best person to talk to is my GP and I intend to do so, but i was wondering if people had found them helpful?

"Quick backstory for context:
I was diagnosed with OCD in 2005 and up until 6 months ago I had been taking anti-depressants. Within the first few years I moved from Clomipramime, to Prozac, then to Seroxat (Paxil), and finally to Sertraline - which I remained on for around 7 years. Having been on it for so long I really wasn't sure if it was working for me, as I had forgotten what it felt like before I was even on them (perhaps they had lost effectiveness anyway during that time?). So, working with a Doctor, I gradually withdrew from them and stopped them completely 6 months ago.
Since then there have been some tough times but I mainly put that down to my body re-adjusting, and hoped that eventually things would sort themselves out. Within the last few weeks though my OCD symptoms have really ramped up - even the slightest thing which wouldn't have bothered me before is now a major cause of anxiety. I have made a Doctor's appointment to get her advice on the matter, but wondered if anybody here has been through a similar situation? I'm not averse to trying medication again but am willing to consider other things - St John's Wort perhaps? The more I read up on it though, the less convinced I am that it would help with OCD...
Something else I'm looking into is CBT - When I was first diagnosed I took part in an OCD group session which was helpful. I'm going to ask the Doctor if she can refer me to a private therapist for one-to-one CBT - the cost would have been prohibitive in the past but I think it's something worth looking into.
Any input would be much appreciated. Thanks!","['hope', 'anxiety', 'anxiety', 'Medication', 'OCD', 'symptom']",0,0,1,0,0,0.0,[],"['ocd', 'symptom', 'medication', 'anxiety', 'hope']",,

At the minute imp paying £75 a session and its really going nowhere because imp just too scared to talk to the poor woman. We always end up talking about trivial things that are irrelevant to what’s going on in my life which is really impacting me. For example about 2 months ago I fell out with my sister and haven’t spoken to her since, this has caused allot of strain on the family and things really aren’t good on that front at the moment, so guess what I’ve never mentioned it to her, not once. It’s weird I can’t talk about it to her but yet I can write it down and let hundreds of people read it most of whom I don’t even know!!!! Well anyway I’ve made the decision, imp not going back to her, it’s been 6 months now. I think it’s a total waste of money. I haven’t told my mum yet though she’ll probably hit the roof!!!

"Okay so 8 month ago I was out and I seen this girl from behind. I checked her out sort of speak. Im sorry if that comes across wrong but if any man tells you they have never done that they are lying. So after checking this girl out from behind I then seen her from the front, then it all started. I could clearly see she was under the age of consent. I could be wrong but I just knew she was. The thoughts that went through my head at that point was “you’re a monster, your awefull, you’re a p******”. I don’t want to mention that word throughout this as its scare the hell out of me. So at this point I was questioning myself in my head. I felt horrible.  A few minutes later for the life of me that I do not know is that I googled the legal status of  a well known porn website. I feel really embarrassed talking about this but I don’t want to leave out any important details. BTW I have stopped watching any porn. Okay so at this point in my life I would usually go to only this porn site, im not addicted in anyway but id go there quiet often. So anyway after seeing this girl I typed this into google and I clicked on a Wikipedia page. This is where it turned out of control the Wikipedia page had information about the porn website and there was a reference page that said Child pornography. My heart stopped, the thought of seeing that word made my current negative feelings hit a higher level. Seeing that word made me feel sick and at that point I deleted my search history as I didn’t want that word anywhere around me. I know it was only a Wikipedia page but seeing that word at that time scared the living hell out of me. So in th space of half hour to an hour from seeing that girl and having thoughts horrible thoughts about that to seeing that word on Wikipedia my life started to change. As soon as I got back to my hotel I phoned my partner to tell her how I was feeling. I didn’t mention about the girl at this point but I remember telling her I feel like the worst of the worst and my exact worlds were “ I felt like ive done/seen something bad online”, that’s how I described how I was feeling.  I was crying at this point and she told me not to be silly. I kind of got myself together and felt a little better. That night I went to bed and got up for the loo in the early hours when I came back to my bed I thought about the girl I saw that previous day and all of a sudden this rush of fear, anxiety, panic, heartbeat racing and heavy breathing came over me. I never felt like this before and the thought come to mind to go outside and end this by jumping off the cliff nearby. It was horrendous! I called my partner and she helped me through this by staying on the phone with me. (By the way I forgot to mention I was away with my dad for a weekend break). I was going home that morning and kept myself together, I went to the doctor next day as I was upset and feeling really anxious. I told people close to me of what happened including my employer as I get upset in work a lot. I told my partner about the girl too when I got home. It was embarrassing but I felt I needed to give every single detail. It was hard but I didn’t want to miss anything out. Ever since that night I have been living with constant anxiety and fear. 8 months on no change if not worse. The constant thought that ive done/seen something wrong on the internet relating back to that day plays on my mind. I cannot tell you what it is as I don’t know myself. There is nothing in my head to say what ive seen/done its just the thought that I have. Because I deleted my search history at the time there is no way I can check for certain. It was the worst thing I did. I've been to phone shops asking if it can be recover but it can not. Is it the word and that girI I saw and my mind has taken it out of control? For one id never look at anything like that but I keep telling myself if I had seen something in relation to that then I would have some sort of memory of it surely! I have absolutely nothing in my head (image/video) only the thought that I have seen something! It’s so frustrating because there is no evidence of anything like that but I cant shake this feeling off. My phone has a child lock on it so I cannot access stuff over 18 years of age whilst using the phones data but can over WiFi. When this happen I was outside using data, but that only gave me a slight relief which didn't last long. 
It repeats and repeats and im always trying to find the solution but nothing helps. Ive reasearched so much about ocd and most of it I can relate to. It’s a slight relief but then it comes back. People tell me id never do that but then im like “what if”. I think about it every hour of the day and whenever something happy happens to me it’s like that big black cloud comes over me and tells me not to be happy and to make the most of it before you go to jail. My thoughts have spiralled out of control now and my mind is now telling me im going to jail and I don’t even now what for. It has told me what's going to happen to my family and that im never going to see the people I love again as everyone will hate me. So to sum it up I constantly have this though that ive done something wrong online but have no idea what it is. Possible it was the girl and the word I saw. I would never do anything like that and it upsets me that my mind is telling me different. Im currently attending mindfulness courses but don’t find its helping. I’m living in constant fear and the scenarios of the future are terrifying. Thoughts of losing everyone and everything. It’s terrifying me. Does ocd catastrophize? Can anybody help or share some advice? I will say at the point this happened at the point my girlfriend was expecting our first child. When this happened I was away from her and was staying in the dirtiest of hotels. I had to put towels on the floors to walk on and a clean duvet from another bed to sleep on as the hotel was very dirty. I’m not sure if this was OCD but thought id mention it, ive always known I suffered with ocd, as when I was younger it would take me a good half hour to get into bed and sleep and I had to do these exhausting rituals. That’s has now gotten better since leaving my parent home and having my own. If I didn’t do these rituals then my parent or me were going to die. Ive never had it professionally diagnosed.

1. it costs an ABSOLUTE fortune being me, my mum and dad buy most of my products whihc include loads of sprays, soap, wipes, shampoo and electricity cause of useing the shower.
2. because i spray my body so much with disinfectant i have dry skin and sometimes it goes red raw and burns so much, like right now i can hardly walk cause of sprayin my feet the joints at the bottom of my toes are all red and its stingy and hard to walk. i sprayed my underwear once to and my inner thighs went all red and i was crying i couldnt sleep i thought i was gona go into septic shock!!
3. it prevents u goin out cause if u do go out u have to get changed and spray ureself again!.
4. medication and depression makes u sleepy so i slept lots and hardly went into uni so i failed this year and im not goin back
5. ure parents get fed up with u and deep down they no theyd rather not have u in the house cause u cant let them live the way they want to and u ruin everything.
6. because i dont care about germs in the way that most contamination people do like there afraid of gettin ill or gettin other people ill, i belive its harder to get rid of mine cause mine is based on facts and logic i supose, even my physcologist says yes there is logic in it so its harder to get rid of i think anyway.
7. i cant see my bf cause he makes me worse and i dont want to get him germy cause i feel really guilty and cry. i havent saw him for 6 weeks already

I guess we are all looking for some support in trying to better understand OCD. I am a mom of two. My 9 year old daughter has just been diagnosed with OCD. We are awaiting our referral to PE CAMHS. It would be great to hear from other parents in what has worked for them with children of a similar age. I have yet to sit down and properly discuss with my daughter what OCD means. I guess I am really trying to get my own head around it first. My daughter does excessive hand washing, hops four times probably 20 times a day; constant sighing; constant sniffing; poor memory; won't go upstairs by herself; a constant worryier and also has short term memory difficulties. She was diagnosed with dyslexia and dyscalculia when she was 7 and we are working on that but I know that causes her self doubt and anxiety. I separated from her father when she was little but that has also caused emotional issues.
Would love to hear from parents who are helping their child to cope with OCD stuff and what you do for yourself to come to peace with it.
Good luck to all.

"Hi everyone
Just checking in with a progress report.
I'm checking the switches at night less - still checking them a little but the urge is falling away and things aren't quite as bad in that department. I'm able to settle down quicker and had a good night's sleep.
This morning, though, was another story. I had to wake up early because of people who are coming to look at the house but I've been stuck in my room all morning with old worries on my plate. I know it sounds awful, but I look into my past, at the vivid thoughts I've had before that might not have all been OCD, for 'ruining' past moments of triumph - and for tripping myself up in the relieved aftermath when I realised I was suffering from depression - and although they haven't stopped me doing anything, I still feel so guilty for having them - for 'allowing' them essentially and not doing anything about them. I didn't want to just write them off because I didn't want to be arrogant. I don't want to 'assume' things and be over-confident; I don't want to just think 'Oh, everything's fine.'
I finally took out the Meditation CD that came with the Mindfulness book and did the first meditation which calmed me a little. I also read the book and came across a passage to do with guilt, that really struck a chord with me, because I felt a lot of what the list described. The trouble was I started to act erratically, trying to force my mind into distraction and basically starting to move and think too fast.
In other parts of my life, things have been picking up - I still feel somewhat sad and had a little weep last night - but I've been sending out more job applications and getting responses and have had a couple of offers for interviews, which has been heartening. I've started to pay more attention to my writing as well. I think things took a turning point when I joined this new creative writing society, because I met new people and it was a welcome change to the tedium.
So, that's where I am at the moment. I really don't want to run myself down, but it's just been one of those mornings when I've had to stay out of my parents' way because they've had other things on their minds and then my Mum got wound up over something with my brother, and I've just been a bit isolated and trying rather too hard to tackle my fears by attempting to 'disprove them.'

"Hi all.
Well *points upwards* yes. Today was difficult. I wrote a lot of my worries down at work in my little journal, just to offload, but I just fancied a chat here. 
I don't quite know what happened today - though I suspect a bad night's sleep didn't help - but I felt very depressed for most of the day. I was on my own a lot and just had all this stuff in my head. I felt alone. I've been having trouble getting along; I struggled at my writer's group last night and some of my friends noted I was distant. I just couldn't 'click in.' I feel very afraid that I'll never get the right help.
In particular, I am STILL even now questioning my own behaviour. I cannot look certain people in the eye because I still get horrid thoughts about them and I'm scared they will know. I can't shake those thoughts off and I want to run away from them and hide. I just don't understand why I still feel like this. I'm so frightened. I just don't know how yo cope and how can I pay attention and engage if I can't look them in the eye? I know a thought is a thought. But I am very, very afraid.

Yes it's a struggle every day and I really mean that it is so hard getting through every day....but I've been having more up or coping moments lately....been more chatty, etc and not as desperately depressed when I wake up usually. Sleeps been better some of the time. Ive started CBT and I like the therapist and usually after I feel alright.
I've been trying to implement some of the coping strategies and didn't do too bad at the wknd...sometimes I still felt bad but managed to work through it....been trying to ignore the thoughts and effectively relabel them.
But todays been really bad....its like all the coping goes out the window...I feel guilty, responsible...haven't been able to postpone my worrying til 'worry time' which Ive just been trying these past few days....Ive been analysing over and over. The thoughts and feelings I get just seem so real sometimes and it's horrible....I suffer from relationship type ocd and it's just horrible. It feels like you can't recover after having a bad day.....Ive come home and cried my eyes out to my boyfriend....I haven't cried so much for ages.
Can I ask your advice about the medication. Yes I have my appetite back, yes my sleep is better sometimes, and yes Im becoming more chatty etc usually....but I am worried about the medication I feel like I just want to STOP it tonight. I worry that it's worsening my ocd...can it do that...can it numb feelings and make thoughts seem more real or is this just the ocd. Im just really worried about what to do....on the one hand I do't want to be massively depressed again AND still have the same thoughts/feelings I get now cos that would be much worse....but I don't feel I can put up with things like this at the moment.....Im on 30mg citalopram....I sometimes feel 'weird' like in a bit of a daze if this makes sense. I just get scared that medication can mess up your emotions and stuff.......
What side effects can you get from just stopping it? I feel like just stopping it and seeing how I feel but Im scared im gonna feel worse.....its a catch 22 situation....feel bad with it, feel bad without it.

"Hello,
I've been away from the boards for a while (too long). Things have been very up and down for me. I came off my medication (Sertraline) quite a while ago - a decision that I'm glad I made and want to stick to, but although I have OCD in my life every day, sometimes it gets really bad and I feel awful - scared, sick, worthless and anxious.
Most days I cope ok (I've had OCD since childhood) but yesterday and today I'm really struggling, so I really hope someone on here can relate to what I'm saying. I feel like such a freak. A total loser.
Basically, the way my OCD works is that I have terrible, nasty or violent thoughts about bad things happening to the people that I love.
When I was little, I would do anything I could to stop my mum from dying. This was related to contamination fears.
The I became OBSESSED with symbols and old carvings, religious pictures and anything I believed that had 'power'. I would believe that these symbols, etc could read my mind and make my bad thoughts come true because they were powerful.
Now I have this scary intrusive thought that I can't shake off. I feel scared writing it in case you all think I am a sick and bed person (maybe I am. I certainly feel like one). But here goes...
My intrusive thought goes 'Pray to the devil' then I think about bad things happening to the people I love. I then believe that these thoughts have the power to make the bad things I thought happen. Therefore I believe that I am cursing the people that I love.
This is just too much for me to deal with - these thoughts pop into my mind at ANY time - when I am happy, sad, reading, watching TV....
I am constantly living with the burden that people I love will be harmed because of my terrible, nasty thoughts.
I am a bad person and I feel worthless.

"Hello All,
Yesterday I had my physical with my new GP. I have met her once before and she seemed kind enough and like a good doctor. I have nervous issues with getting my yearly exam, due to my PTSD, and I had made plans to bring my SO with me.
During the consult portion of the visit I mentioned I was considering going off of my meds- (Lexapro-escitalopram). I told her that when I first started taking them I was told by my psychiatrist it would not be forever and I have had serious weight gain. Now, I admit I have always been a bit bigger and do not exercise as one should because of my fibromyalgia but I have gained near 5 stone in the last two years!! It is taking a toll on me physically and mentally.
Her response was that I should not come off the meds because she is afraid I will become suicidal- something I have not been in 10-15 years- despite being unmedicated. She also said and I quote """"""""I don't want you getting all suicidal and not being able to get a job. He (meaning my SO) will just get so frustrated and say 'I am out of here'.""""""""
I was awestruck at the callousness of her remark- Did she really just say that my SO would leave me if I went off my meds?? Did she really just assume that she somehow knew the dynamic of our relationship? Has she even looked at my charts from my old doctors!!!!
I was so upset that I just shut up and listened to her babble on about switching to Prozac by adding the Prozac for 3-4 weeks and then taking away the Lexapro. I said I would think about it.
Here is where I am torn. I would normally just say off and get a new doctor but physically she has been really helpful and is even trying to get me into a pain clinic for the fibro- if my insurance will cover it. She also located a lump yesterday and I have to go for a mammogram. All in all a VERY upsetting visit.
I just do not know what to do??? Do I keep seeing her, do I find a new doctor? Do I say something to her about how much she upset us? My SO's blood was boiling, he held his tongue but was turning bright red in the face and white knuckled.

i just want to say a big sorry to everyone that has helped me over the last few months, im sure u must be sick of me and tired of me going round and round in circles
Alot of the time i honestly dont realise i am or seeking reasurrance. Only since Scooby pointed this out to me that it has started to make sense and i feel like a fool.
I have been finding the OCD/Anxiety very hard over the last few months, i have good days like all of us, but when i have a hard one its REALLY hard.
And coming here is like a sacntury for me as i am not alone, i feel bad that i have been asking for reassurance on subjects alot of the time but i really didnt mean to.
Im thinking i should visit/post less as i am worried about what i post now incase it is reassurance.
I had a great group session today at CBT (last one in 2 weeks) and we did alot of work on my thoughts, and worked though our thought diaries. I learnt alot today,
I mentioned when i was there that everything seems sooo clear when they talk through things with me, facing up to the fears etc and looking at the evidence for and against the thought.
But when i am alone and feeling low i do tend to struggle and the hard work does vanish. I need to just keep on top of this i guess and keep working on it.
So i just want to say thanx again to everyone, and i wish / hope i can help people here as much as they have helped me.
much love to all!

Looking back, I think that I probably developed OCD when I was 9 or 10. I had all sorts of crazy rituals, like racing around the kitchen trying to touch all the counter tops before the refrigerator door closed, otherwise something terrible would happen. Unfortunately, I don't think my mom knew not to indulge my reassurance seeking, so I often went to her confessing my thoughts and worries. After some unsuccessful therapy and taking medication for a couple years, OCD left me alone for a while. Now it seems to be back to bully me some more. I'm now a junior in high school, and since I'm facing some pretty big changes next year in addition to regular stress from school, I'm hoping that the OCD will go away once the stress does.

I don't post in this forum much these days, mainly because I can't think of a single useful thing to say that's going to help anyone.
Anyway, so I'm sorry to be offloading again here, but am feeling a bit wiped out and a bit down tbh with you.
It's coming to the end of term at college - the end of a very long two years for me, in July I graduate and hopefully get my PGCE (I say hopefully - more on that later). I've got about three weeks left until I finish, and my workload is off the scale. On top of all my coursework I've got all my students to think about - and two lots of assignments to mark (about 30 pieces of coursework), plus all the lesson planning and final admin to do. It seems like once I get one bit done - I find something else that I've not done, or not completed or someone else drops an extra load of work on me.
I'd supposedly finished my 5,000 word research project this afternoon - gone back to check over what I've done and realised I've left a load of important stuff out of it - and it's got to be handed in Monday. I just don't have time to sort it now.
On top of all that, the LEA lost all my original finance forms - had to refill them all in, and was told that I woudn't be able to graduate until December. I got them all organised and this week was told I'd be able to get my results - great news - but now I've decided that I can't face going to the graduation ceremony because of the way I look. The last time I graduated was in 2001, and I was shall we say - a lot heavier than I am now - was really quite overweight and podgy, and now I'm almost 4 stone lighter and looking hideous, I just can't face the cap and gown shenanigins - plus the remarks from my folks on how bad I look. My Dad's already made a few remarks here and there about how much difference there is between me then and me now.
So although I'm gonna be finished soon, it just doesn't feel like it - it feels neverending, like the final mountain is just too much, and that I'm really slipping again. Been feeling a bit off since I did my teaching on Wednesday - nothing that I can put my finger on, just tired, down, extremely headachy and depressed.
I know I have to do it, but I think it's gonna finish me off. I feel very unprepared to be a 'proper' teacher, very unprepared for what lies ahead of me and wondering whether I'm trying to do something that's not right for me. I'm not sure I can cope with the OCD and being a teacher. I don't think I'm strong enough.
I know there's folks on here with far more serious issues and problems than me so I'll shut up now and go away. Just needed a rant really.","['drop', 'overweight', 'OCD', 'hope']",0,0,0,0,0,0.0,['hand'],"['ocd', 'overweight', 'hope', 'hand', 'drop']",,
"well, i had my teeth taken out on friday under sedation and all went well, still a bit painful but all seems to be healing nicely.
have decided to have them replaced as eating is now a major chore and it's causing all kinds of issues, like fear of knocking out remaining teeth etc.
phoned the dentist this morning to make an appointment to discuss dentures and other options and they managed to get me an appointment today, so i went. i thought we would just sit and talk about it and then i could make a decision, but when i got there they put me in the chair and had a good look etc which freaked me out a bit (dentist was very good, knows about my ocd, was really gentle and talked me through it all), when he finished he told me that it all looked good and that there was no infection which i was pleased about, then he went through my options, implants, which are a no no due to cost and pain and fear of dental treatment, bridge, but again would mean working on the teeth either side and he knows i wont do it due to having to go back and have mouth numbed etc so would mean sedation again which means going private which is really expensive so it was decided that best option is dentures. i liked the idea of that (makes me feel old though) as it means no pain or work to be done. once we decided it i thought he would tell me to make another appointment to get it started but he didn't, he did the moulds then and there. i hated it coz it made me gag, tasted horrid and meant putting that blue plasticine stuff in my mouth. again he was really good and now i have 3 more appointments and then i will have all my teeth again. but i'm really freaking out because i have to go back again and i'm worried that it will all go wrong. i'm worried also that the blue mould thing might have loosened my teeth or infected my mouth where the teeth had been taken out. i haven't eaten all day coz i'm so worried about my teeth coming out.
i keep thinking that i should just cancel the appointments and go without teeth because i deserve it, my brain keeps telling me that all this happened because i'm a bad person. like bad karma coming back on me.

I washed her hands when she'd finished, but not as thoroughly as I'd have liked because she's 3, and wouldn't keep still.
She has now sat in her car seat and all over my sofa in the clothes she was wearing at the time (so now I think everything is contaminated) because I didn't want to stick her in the bath straight away......because then the ocd would have won right?
My stomach has been a in a knot ever since, my mind has gone into overdrive with all the possible diseases she could catch.
I spoke to my hubby, who is usually the yardstick I go by.....(if he's not worried then it must be ocd) and even he seemed a bit grossed out. Which has made me even worse.

A bit like that? Combatting the myth about Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder.
As a Clinical Psychologist working with people affected by Obsessive Compulsive Disorder (OCD), there are six words that for me epitomise the level of ignorance that exists around OCD: â€˜Oh, Iâ€™m a bit like thatâ€™. Weâ€™ve all heard someone say them. Whether itâ€™s someone referring to the fact they like a tidy desk at work, or someone talking about how grim some festival toilets were, weâ€™ve all heard someone discuss how they can be â€˜a bit OCD about things like thatâ€™.
OCD, in this misunderstood form, seems to have become a very popular disorder. People view OCD as a quirky character trait meaning you like things done in a certain way, or in a certain order, or have your own routine which you are fond of and like to stick to. Alternatively, due to the mediaâ€™s insistence as portraying OCD as an addiction to hand-washing and an intolerance of germs, OCD is viewed as an almost positive character trait. People believe by declaring themselves as â€˜a bit OCDâ€™ they are proudly declaring that they keep their home neat and tidy. Indeed nowadays it seems that people seem to aspire to have OCD and are very keen to tell others â€˜Oh, Iâ€™m a bit like thatâ€™.
I wonder whether these people would still be keen to say they are a bit like that if they truly understood OCD? If by saying â€˜Oh, Iâ€™m a bit like thatâ€™ they knew they were admitting to thoughts of harming a loved one, anxiety about driving because they believed they had run someone over, or harbouring such fears about contamination that they would be unable to hug their own child? OCD seems to have become an illness that those without it feel comfortable laughing about, as demonstrated by the recent release of an â€˜OCD Chefâ€™ chopping board which features precise measurement lines for â€œfinicky foodiesâ€ and a claim that â€˜it is anti-bacterial so doesnâ€™t need scrubbing 11 times to make sure itâ€™s cleanâ€™. Hilarious. I wonder when did we decide it was ok to laugh at people who are having their lives ruined by an anxiety disorder? People who struggle alone for years and, when they finally get the courage to tell friends and colleagues, have their anxieties dismissed as â€˜oh, Iâ€™m a bit like that tooâ€™?
As part of raising awareness for OCD it is important to dispel this myth about OCD somehow being a positive life-style choice. Those with OCD will be able to tell people just how tough it is- and they should. It is only by those with OCD finding the courage to share their experiences and raise awareness about what OCD actually looks and feels like that people will learn it is no laughing matter. I work hard to dispel the myths around OCD, but I find that my role tends to be supporting and guiding those who are aware of their own OCD towards effective treatment. However there is a much wider issue of public perception that needs addressing. Until people stop viewing OCD as a positive character quirk, we will be unable to move towards greater recognition and support for those individuals and their families who are affected.
I have had so many interesting conversations with people when Iâ€™ve overheard them say something inaccurate or jokey about OCD and the biggest response I get from people is total surprise. People just simply do not know or appreciate just how complex and severe a condition OCD is and itâ€™s about time they knew. I plan to use this awareness week to talk to as many people as possible about the realities of OCD and what they can do to help raise awareness. I see this week as a fantastic opportunity and I know we can get a really positive message across about how important it is to help those affected by OCD. But maybe thatâ€™s just me. Because, you know, Iâ€™m just a bit like that.

i have always been a bit of an extrovert. Even as an eleven year old I remember sticking bouncy balls down my top to make people laugh and my friends being too scared to. Yet I am also quite shy and can be socially awkward!! It's like when comedians are funny to cover their shyness. I'm also very soft hearted and a bit of a geek. Yet sometimes when I go out I wear low cut tops (naturally big chested) and blonde hair extensions as I like looking glamourous and sexy. But I feel like I am attracting the wrong guys. I feel like they expect me to be a loud blonde bimbo. I'm actually into Harry Potter and geeky stuff like that lol. So I feel lost. I see pictures of myself and I think is this really me? Sometimes I think I wear all the make up and low cut stuff to make myself seem pretty as I don't feel pretty naturally. I worry that I won't attract a nice guy as I am portraying myself wrong. But at the same time I like the Glamourous look. so I feel confused who I am. I feel I should either be a geek with dark hair or a bimbo with blonde hair big boobs. I'm lost so how can I attract someone when I don't even know who I am??!! Would a nice guy be able to see past my outer mask and see I am vulnerable and nice deep down? Or should I change myself?

"Last night I was out and when I went back to my car I stepped in something brown and mushy that was on the road. It has been wet and the temperature warmer than usual so there is a lot of ice and puddles and general muck about.
This area of the city is, sadly, a popular area for dog fouling so naturally my head went there. Regular readers of my diatribes will also know that I have fairly terrible luck when it comes to this and it is a top fear of mine. In this case I couldn't be sure but I expected the worst.
I wiped my feet on some ice, got in my car, and proceeded to take my child to her moms place.
However, after dropping off my daughter I decided I wanted to be sure whether or not it was dog fouling. That way I could decide how I was going to deal with it. So...
I then went back, half way across the city, armed with some wooden sticks and some hand wipes. I found the spot where I'd parked, got out, and inspected the mess I had stepped in. Lucky for me it turned out to be a wad of papers covered in road grime but flattened to the point of being unrecognizable mush until I pulled it apart.
So... This incident has a lot of questions attached to it. Admittedly I don't see a lot of people inspecting detritus on the ground in the dark night with a pair of chopsticks. I am glad nobody saw me. Was it okay to make sure that it was or was not dog fouling? Am I supposed to assume it was and NOT do anything? Am I supposed to assume it was and then proceed like I did last month when it DID happen and wind up with new shoes, new car mats, and wipe the pedals? Was it even remotely good to face the fear of what it could have been and inspect it?
When I did CBT years ago one of the issues was my exwife and her family were going to bathe my daughter in water that was not safe to drink. I was told by my therapist that it was not OCD to find out what was wrong with the water and to get advice from the local health department (who agreed with me that it was not safe to bathe my daughter in the bad water, but I digress). Is checking this (once) in the same vein?

"Today my friend and I were talking and we somehow got on to the subject of being organised and tidy, she was saying how she loves a good tidy, and we giggled over how funny we can both be at having things 'just the way we like them...' and she said 'yeah it's a bit ocd of me...'
Also another of my friends said before that she likes colour co-ordinating things and gets 'really ocd' about it.
What do you guys make of this? I can't decide if I am actually a bit offended, because I keep thinking, yes but you DON'T have ocd, and you have no idea how awful it really is - it's not just being tidy or liking things in a certain order, it's the whole mentality and experience of the world that goes with it, how you have to think in a certain way and you can't do things, and it's draining. Or am I being harsh, because as it has been said before, everyone can be said to be somewhere on the ocd spectrum, but just not to the extent that it is with some of us...
I just don't know how to take it, especially as this girl didn't know I have ocd... do I say, well actually I have ocd and it's like this... or just smile and let it go. She was laughing about it, I don't know maybe I'm just being oversensitive, but it seems people who don't really know much about it assume that if they like things neat and tidy, or have a little quirk, it is 'quite ocd', and also, that it's really funny. It's also just the wrong phrasing of the term that gets me, how can you be really ocd?? you HAVE ocd, you can't BE ocd I'm getting het up over nothing aren't i? I just wondered what you thought, and also your views on what you would reply? I know I shouldn't be but I can get pretty embarrassed talking about it with people who don't understand.
(I told the girl with the colour co-ordinating thing, that I had been diagnosed, and she looked really doubtful, and said 'really? That's a strange diagnosis! What about you is ocd?' arrrggghhhhhhhhh)

"Hello everybody 
I haven't been here in awhile, as since I've increased my medication, my ocd and overall mood as been better than ever. I find that the best way of describing it is that I felt that my head was filled with dark, grey clouds and now there's some sunshine coming through.
The only side effect I've experienced is weight gain. A lot. Some days I struggle with it and other days I'm fine, since it is a decent tradeoff for having a manageable ocd. 
However, my mother is a very superficial person and we don't get along that well. She keeps trying to put me on diets, she even got me an appointment with a nutritionist against my will, she keeps pressuring me to go on walks with her, etc. On the one hand I get what she's doing, but on the other hand, she's not doing it for my wellbeing. She just doesn't want to have a fat kid. She told me I was too young to get fat. I'm 22, 1.57m tall and I weigh 60kg. I used to weigh about 50kg before I started medication. 
All she cares about is looks and how men view her. I couldn't give a ****. I've always been single and I'd rather be alone then having to rely on men to be happy. We are on two ends of the spectrum and we've always had our differences.
I don't eat badly and would rather not have to go on diets. I find that unlike before, the medication makes it much harder to lose weight. On my last appointment I thought about telling my psychiatrist, but ended up not to and now that I can finally feeling positive side effects, I don't know if I should... I take pregabalin and paroxetine, as well as gabapentin for migraines. 
I don't even know why I'm writing this, but I just felt like something I needed to do...

"Hi guys,
Forgive me if I have mentioned/asked this before. I did check before I posted but I can't see anything, so if I have, please excuse me :original:
I just wondered whether anyone elses' OCD sort of 'interrupts' with conversation? I was diagnosed with Pure O earlier this year and sometimes I find my OCD kind of buts in if I'm talking (truthfully, that's most times ). Sometimes, it'll want me to say something like """"""""right, and now to kill you"""""""" after a conversation. It causes me some panic but not a lot, probably because I'm 99% sure it's OCD and I can sort of use my inner conscience to give it that disapproving look, so this is really just to see whether anyone else finds this, or whether my OCD is a bit of an oddball!
Obviously, it's a bit scary because that bit of me starts with the """"""""what if?"""""""" thoughts. Flipside to that I see those for what they are, anxiety and panic. I know some OCD sufferers believe they are schizophrenic, so maybe it's a bit like that? I know I'm not, I know these thoughts are my own, but the are sort of the total opposite to what I want to say and, obviously, they distract me from what I really meant to say!
Also, does anyone find """"""""breakfast tea"""""""" to make anxiety worse? I've read in several places some teas help, but I find breakfast tea to be one of the worst! I get that huge surge of adrenaline, flap about for an hour or two, panic a bit more, burn out, sleep...then I'm OK!
I have just had a kind of stressful few hours as my neighbours kicked off again and the stray moggy's momma turned up, quite a lot to deal with when anxiety has it's claws in you. I am doing my best to focus on the here and now (not too much to do, I am doing X task etc) but it's hard to keep it up, it does take time.
Just throwing it out there anyway, I know about awfulizing and what if thoughts and so on, but I've never known those sort of thoughts. Anyone else? I wouldn't be surprised if I'm the odd one out! Story of my life! Lol

"Hi my name is Nicky been an OCD sufferer for 11 years this is my 1st relapse happened 4 weeks ago heres a tip ive found helpful, When you get that 'thought' allow it in, breathe deeply, tell yourself that it is NOT your thought it's an OCD thought and dont connect/engage with it just let it be, even if the content is scary, remember its your OCD pattern of thinking, it will throw allsorts of themes and added thoughts to it to upset you and get you to analyse it. Dont give in to it, it doesnt reflect YOU as a person, if you were that person you wouldnt worry about it you would find it pleasant and you certainly wouldnt be on here looking for REASSURANCE. This has helped me from looking up NHS OCD information pages, peoples experiances and many other self help. Its helped me loads.

"Hello,
I hope everyone is having a good January so far.
Until last week I hadn't been to the cinema (something I love doing) for a long time for fear of contamination. I've also avoided public places for the past few months because of the norovirus outbreak.
On Wednesday I went to see a film with my family- I thought we were going to a 'safe' town but we ended up going to a town where I knew there has been a norovirus outbreak (the local hospital had two wards closed down a couple of weeks ago). I was petrified about the whole thing!
When we got there I didn't want to go in and noticed a vomit-like wet patch on the carpet near the loos (Mum thought it looked like a leak from the loo- which was worse!) so I was even more determined to leave. I went and sat in the car but then decided to watch the film- I actually thought we were 80% likely to catch norovirus!
On the negative side I still can't use public toilets so was very worried about needing the loo and I couldn't eat because I didn't want to put my hands anywhere near my face so I'll have to work on those two things (and try not to forbid my family from using the loos next time). I also made everyone use loads of anti-viral foam so that's another thing to reduce and I showered for about an hour afterwards so I guess it wasn't that amazing!. It's tricky to describe how traumatic a normal activity like that can be when you have contamination worries but anyway I'm glad I got through it!
Today I'm worried because there was a bit of dry tissue on the living room floor. I think it looked like a little rolled up bit of public-toilet loo roll (the thin, cheap stuff) and that it might have been on the back of someone's shoe. The cat lay on it and I'm worried about her lying on my family member's beds (I leave my door shut). Is this very silly?

"Hmmm. Been doing well recently but realised that I still actually avoid a lot of places due to OCD.
I like to think I'm coping fine because I work and have a very fruitful social life, creative outlets etc...
But I still find it almost impossible to walk through a large open space or sit in a park. My Girlfriend raised the park thing the other day and said it was a source of great sadness to her.. :-(
Guilt... wonderful.
The agoraphobic thing is an utter horrid by product of my 'thoughts.'
For all the mechanisms I have in place for my Pure-O I just can't manage as well when I'm sleep deprived; today I'm supposed to wander over to Shepherds Bush station, get on the tube, change once and get off at Waterloo where I'm meeting my GF to go to Bournemouth.
Now before I even get into how many triggers there might be on the South Coast, the trip to Waterloo is intimidating me massively. Even the walk to the station will be hard today and I don't wanna run there like a loon... I'll get triggers on the tube platform and worse to come if I have to wait too long for the next train at Bond St. When I get to Waterloo I'm going to feel terrified and fenzied; that station is an utter trigger for me and I don't know how I'm gonna manage. I'd like to get my GF to meet me somewhere right next to the tube so at least I'm with her when I walk across the big open Concourse area but she seems to have little patience for this 'occasional' side of my personality.
Which is wierd considering that she's obsessive compulsive as well (More ritualistic and controlling than me, we have different ends of the OCD coin see!) she doesn't really understand the panic attack feelings I get in public. Unfortunately, she's resolved a few 'Pure O' things in her, whereas I've sorted out most things of a ritualistic nature, so we both have a bit of a 'well you always have a choice' attitude to each others problems.
Sigh I don't know what this post will accomplish, I'm just after sympathy I suppose... :blushing:
Feel a lil trapped and on a collision course with something irrational and awful. Like I'm going to utterly lose it in the tube staion or on the street! :-(

I've been spending some time looking into myself and trying to face the truth. I'm 25 and I don't know, maybe that's just part of growing up.

"Yesterday I had my last individual therapy for a while. My psychiatrist wants me to have some family therapy first to sort out my childhood issues, which they believe is the cause of my OCD. I am a bit scared about this, because since December when I was an inpatient at a private hospital I have been seeing a therapist once a week and been going to an OCD group (which has also finished).
It was quite a shock at the OCD group yesterday. A man in the group who has had OCD for a year has recovered and doesn't need to see his psychiatrist anymore. I have had it for 8 years and even though I do everything I am told to do I still have it the same as a few years ago when I started therapy.
Once the family therapy is over my psychiatrist is going to hopefully find me a therapist in my local area, so I can get there by myself. The family therapy could go on for 4 weeks. I have been having therapy once a week since September if you include the sort of therapy I received from the NHS, so I am very scared and unsure about waiting 4 weeks.
I feel so bad because of all the money being spent on my treatment, mainly by my mother-in-law. I feel I am letting them down, because I still have all my problems. I believe I am trying my best and my therapist and psychiatrist do to, but the improvement is very small.
Then there is the family therapy that is very scary, because my relationship with my parents is very fragile and they know the professionals blame my childhood for my illnesses. I don't know what to believe anymore. I don't remember my childhood and in all the photos I am smiling. I know I was a worrier as a child, but not abused in anyway. My parents aren't like that.

"OK Right
I have posted alot about bpd fear, i know i keep posting about this subject, and it seemed to go away, but it seems to have snuck back in a new form.
I have started seeing a girl, we have a friend in common, a guy who is a bit irritating, but a nice guy, but he can really get on my nerves and enjoys winding me up sometimes. She gets on well with him, and spends a lot of time with him. I dont have a problem with their being friends as I get on well with him myself, but I did feel a bit jealous and Im on my period, so ended up being irritable, we also got into a few arguments of political views etc and I know Im easy to wind up, Where politics is concerned. I did tell them i was on my period and that was why I was hormonal. I havent told this guy we're going out, he knows im with someone but i've not told him who. I dont know if shes told him. I dont care and I know Im being paranoid about this guy because I get on OK with him on his own. We've only really had one date since I asked her out, the other two times we've been with him and i've not kissed her or anything.
Anyway, I felt very irritated today as i was a bit left out as they were talking about geeky things i know nothing about, and I found myself becoming irritated at his jokes etc, i didnt really say anything. When they left they left together. That isnt the problem I dont mind girls im going out with being with guys I just find this guy annoying, especially today. I know that sounds horrible. I know I can be annoying myself and tactless.
Howevver the problem is this. I think what if this means i have bpd? I know it will always find something to attack me with. I keep thinking Im possessive, (of my gf) controlling and insecure and intolerant of my gf's right to have friends, like my dad is to my mum. I keep thinking the reason Im irritated and threatened by this guy (which I know is unreasonable) is because I have bpd. Will this stupid bpd fear ever go? I know I have started many threads on this subject and I am sorry for starting another. I am not looking to be reassured. I wanted a rant at how annoyed I am at my OCD for bringing my fear of bpd back just when I have started seeing someone. I keep imagining verbally insulting my gf and making her cry.

"Hi guys,
I had another lovely moment today and I wanted to share it with you. Too much of OCD is full of negative, here was a negative turned out positive :original:
I woke up in a state of panic and dashed out of bed at 5:30am this morning to answer a call of nature. Normally if I woke up at that time I'd roll over and try and sleep, but I knew by the time I got back in to bed, with the alarm going off at 6am, it was pretty pointless. So I got up half an hour early. My OCD was giving me a tough time, but I ignored it and persevered. I stuck my slippers on, trudged my way into the kitchen and got some water. I then picked my keys up off the table, quietly unlocked the back door and sat on the bench outside.
Oh wow, what a beautiful moment.
As I sipped my water and let the bird's chorus melt away my anxiety, I breathed slowly, deeply. I closed my eyes and just listened, to the fountain, the birds, the Earth just waking up around me. Everyone else was asleep, but that didn't matter. This was my moment here and now. The warm morning sun on my face and the cold water cooling down the burning adrenaline that was running through my brains. There was no more panicking, I couldn't panic, the moment was too precious to panic. I think this will be a moment that lives with me for a long time. Such a simple pleasure, but oh so beneficial.
I'm now cracking on with some housework, no surprise I've been so calm I'm on my second lot of laundry and the dishes are done. Hubby hasn't even started work yet!

"Hi, as my username suggests- I Hate My Womb, I'm 25 and I have hated my womb from a young age. At first I thought it was having a period I hated, having a period was always very traumatic for me, I felt unclean, shameful, I was forever checking if I had made a mess of my clothes, or any bathroom I would use- eventually along with my periods in my early teens came depression, rounds of medication and treatment for 'period pains'. For years the Dr's told me that my womb was healthy and my depression was a seperate issue and that period pain/feeling low was all part of being a normal woman....well I'm not a normal woman, I'm a woman that would be much happier with a hystorectomy.
I have asked several times for this procedure and I keep being told that I may change my mind and want children, that I'm too young to know what I want.
Its not that I hate my vagina, its that I hate the capacity to have a child, I hate everything about it! I hate that it could have a thing growing in it, that egges are realeased, that the lining bleeds away once a month, It makes me so depressed thinking about it, I cant explain it- I have had my periods stopped through a contraceptive injection and I'm medicated for OCD, depression and BDD, luckily for the Dr's its the same umbrella of medicine so they just give me anti-depressants and keep upping the dose.
I do feel slightly better now that I dont have a period, but I know I still have a functioning womb and it doesnt feel part of me, its not something I want my body to have, if I had a hystorectomy, yes I would look the same, but I would feel complete, some days I wish I did not have a healthy womb so they would have to take it out (by womb I mean ovaries and fullopion tubes and some lining).
I don't have facebook, I hate looking at pictures of myself and I rarely let people take them, I have even had my vagina tattooed to try and make me feel better about whats inside me.
Most people just don't understand, I used to despair and cry everynight and some days was unable to leave the house or go to college/work.
I just wish I would stop being belittled by the medical profession for 'not knowing my own body'. It's mine, I live in it all day everyday, I know what would make me happy and I have felt like this since I was young and taught what the reproductive system does in science class.
JUST TAKE IT AWAY
anyway, I would like to hear from other people with BDD, any help/ advise is welcome, Thanks","['Thought', 'shame', 'checking', 'bathroom', 'Medication', 'Treatment', 'OCD', 'despair', 'depression']",0,0,0,0,0,0.0,['thought'],"['ocd', 'medication', 'checking', 'treatment', 'shame', 'despair', 'depression', 'thought', 'bathroom']",,
"Hi all
something very strange happend to me earlier today, i was going through old doccuments having a clear out and found an old email address.
I logged in to see if i had any messages etc as its been dead for years.
and i found a message there from 2009 from a reply to a health board i posted on back then. This is when i was posting daily on these boards for HIV worries etc.
I clicked on it and felt a little odd doing it, but didnt want to just avoid it.
It was a response to a thread i wrote years ago about a time i used my mums diabetic lancet pen to test my blood sugar levels to see if i was diabetic as i was v ill at the time
long story short i freaked out a few months after using this thinking i could have caught HIV off it etc as my sister used it at one point and i dont know her HIV status. Even though everyone from Terrence higgins trust to health proffessionals telling me that it wasnt a needle as it isnt hollow. 0 risk of catching anything etc! you know how OCD doesnt let the facts sink in!
Anyway i read it, felt weird as it re surfaced all of these old wounds, and i kinda got a little trapped and its still lingering but i know i have moved on and i know that there is 0 risk even though this post told me that i should get tested. This is what made me worry abit, reading those replies again
this is where i think i have made an improovement though. I deleted the email, deleted the link to the site that it was from as i read the reply. and cleared the history on my laptop so i cant keep going back to it to study every word. Which the old me would have done.

"Hi everyone
ok i know im going on about this and should just leave it, but my logic is coming in
and thanx to Bobby yesterday aswell with all his input with the situation
basically when i left the party i walked with a male friend to get some take out before getting a cab home. Spoke normally and was quite with it.
this is where the logic is kicking in that i didnt kiss the girl at the party. Basically i remember panicing cos my mobile phone was dead and i couldnt write myself a note saying that i didnt talk to the cab driver or anything.
So i paniced thinking oh no im gonna think 2mw that i slept with him (i did think that yesterday) but there was no worry or thought about the girl from the party.
So i would have been pancing about that and dying of guilt let alone worrying about getting a cab.
does that make sense?
i think what is making this thought linger is that i am quite cuddly, and so was the girl at the party. So we all hung out arms around eachother, my mind must have just really run a mile with it all and came up with its own story
as mentioned before, i am sooo faithfull and i consider a snog just as bad as sleeping with someone, and would have felt guilt there and then","['Thought', 'guilt']",0,0,0,0,0,0.0,['thought'],"['guilt', 'thought']",,
"So my period has ended, so I am back to obsessing over my breasts. Basically that the left is higher than the right and then realizing that I have no idea why I thought that and it should actually be the other way around.
I haven't looked down for three years. I even blindly measured it yesterday with a ruler and decided that the left my be much bigger than the right. I do remember that the left was a fraction higher than the right, despite the right being much bigger, when viewed from the side, I remember asking my mom for reassurance for this and I believe that she pointed it out.
So anyway I looked down, not the whole breast just the top when sitting. The left is still small compared to the right which is actually a fraction higher and I mean less than a Cm, when I stood up I asked my brother and he said that the left is a minuscule bit higher than the right when viewed from the side, so in short...they are about the same height...
So...my brain is still clutching at straws and my day has been ruined but it proves that nothing is as it seems in our mind + I did sort of look down

"Hello everyone,
I am a new member to this forum, well I used to post on here about 4-6 years ago as OCD_Sarah. I just wanted to say hi to you all.
I am an OCD sufferer. I am 29 years old and I was diagnosed when I was 14 years old, though I believe I had it for most of my childhood prior to my diagnosis. I am currently suffering a relapse. I have been off work for nearly 3 months now and am quite housebound. My problems are fear that I will cause harm to others and contamination problems, involving inability to use a loo other than my one at home. I have excessive cleaning routines around using the toilet, which are approximately 1 hour per trip, though that is without all of the gearing up involved, so it effectively takes up around 3 hours a time. When working my checking was excessive, taking up hours of unpaid time. I am seeing an NHS Psychiatrist and they are trying to find a suitable medication. I will soon be starting drug number five, all tried in the last 3 months. There is currently no CBT available, due to a lack in trained professionals.
I had a severe episode in 2002-2004, where I was eventually hospitalised for 3 weeks and I feel that if I do not improve soon I may be hospitalised again. I am exhausted and depressed. I think about dying every day and I am losing the will to carry on. The last time I got ill I had the hope of recovery, this time I just feel that my life is going to be a constant round of relapse and partial recovery. After my last bout I never fully recovered to minimal OCD levels. My family support has dropped off as the novelty of my relapse has worn off, only my partner remains loving and supportive. i think that is why I am here, to be with people who understand. So that I can feel I am not alone.
I do not want to demoralize other sufferers so it is worth pointing out that I am probably above average in severity and my experiences are no those of an average sufferer.
On the flip side, I do have a vast knowledge and experience of OCD, also experience of hospitalisation, so if I can offer any advice I would be glad to help.

"The phrase """"""""a bump in the road"""""""" is often used when something goes wrong.
A bump in the road doesn't mean things grind to a halt or go backwards, it's not a negative.
The problem with OCD and anxiety is that it's so easy to see the negatives in a situation rather than the positives.
This afternoon my boyfriend had an honest chat with me about our relationship.
Our normal routine changed after summer, my mental health got worse, we moved to a smaller place, he is at home looking for a job having finished uni, we spend time with each other constantly, but that means it's easy to lose sight of how much you appreciate each other. You lose normal conversation, because I don't need to ask what he's spent his day doing, he's in the same room as me.
He realised that by trying to help me get better he has bubble wrapped me, he's taken all the chores and made them a part of his routine. My ocd is based around the theme of loss, the fear of losing those closest to me, but the routine we have adopted recently is exacerbating the problem. It's unhealthy.
He said (and I agree) that we need to start spending more time apart (Be it a few hours, or a day or two). What would happen to my anxiety when we both get full time jobs, if we've spent the past year constantly together? Obviously it would increase. Not only that, but my ocd has stopped me from spending time on my own, with friends, away from him.
I started to cry when we were talking because I was so upset my mental health had had this impact. But it's not just my health, it's a whole host of things. From now on I'm giving myself a proper 9-5 routine.
The days of the week I'm not at Uni I will go to my parents to do work. I have found a yoga class and will go one evening a week. I will spend more time with my friends and family. I will cook for him for half of the week days. I will reclaim my fair share of the chores.
A bump in the road does not stop the car from moving. A few weeks ago this conversation would have frightened the life out of me. But it's a positive. The only way to get better is to get on with it. Sod OCD. I need to reclaim my life, and this conversation, this bump in the road is the motivation I need.
I hope other members here have their own bumps in the road and can share them here, they are part of life and we've all got to keep the car moving forward.","['fear', 'talking', 'hope', 'anxiety', 'anxiety', 'OCD']",0,0,1,0,0,0.0,['theme'],"['ocd', 'fear', 'talking', 'anxiety', 'hope', 'theme']",,1
"Hi everyone,
I haven't posted in a while, as I have tried to stay away from the forums as I thought that this was doing nothing other than help feed my anxiety and thoughts.
Anyway, I'm having a bad time at the minute.
I appreciate that you guys out there all have your own problems, and that perhaps I am just repeating everything that you have heard/read a thousand times open, but I have nowhere else to turn.
What's more, I don't blame any one for not replying, but if any one cuold take a moment to help me out a little then I would be really grateful.
Anyway, I have been trying to battle my pedo thoughts/feelings. As I say, before I think my OCD started, around 18 months ago, I NEVER looked at children or had any such thoughts/feelings.
I have been trying some of my own exposure. I have been looking at images of girls in catalogues on the internet, facing my anxiety. To be honest I have had mixed results.
As some of you may know, sometimes I am hit with the unstoppable feelings of attraction. My heart sinks immediately. I sit with the imagine, trying to battle these feelings. I have took the other approach, allowing the feelings to be there, which freaks me out, to be honest.
Sometimes, after a while the attraction will go. Indeed, there are images that I come across now that at one point I would have had groinal responses and everything to, but now, nothing. Which is all well and good.. you would think.
I jsut don't know what I am doing right/wrong. It takes a while for the feelings of attraction to subside. When I am out in the street, a young girl may walk by and I will be fixated on her. I instantly start checking for an attraction. I CANNOT help but check for attractions. Even when looking at images, how can you not check? What else are you supposed to think? If I look at an image, my mind automatically works out any attraction. that is something ive never understood.
But yes, I become fixated. This worries me. I feel horrible all the time I am looking but I need clarity.
Just now I drove past a girl that was perhaps 5 years old! And my mind was screaming an attraction at me. I didnt have time to sit and stare and let the attraction subside.
What am I supposed to do? Just carry on with the exposure like this or is there anything else I can do?
I cant stand it any more. Just walkign around and theres a little girl... before I would have thought nothing on it... not interested.. just a girl... now, theres a young girl, I am attracted. must keep looking and wait for it subside.
If any one has been through this and come out the other side I would love to talk to you! I am 21 years old, (just) and I feel as though I am living a nightmare.
I hope you are all well.

"Keep busy and exercise.
Keeping the mind distracted eases rumination.Exercise burns off stress chemicals.Lets get busy and burn some stress off.
Lets:
Get some """"""""me"""""""" time - resentments lead to unhelpful emotions.
Stop asking questions - rumination makes things worse. Accept things.
Focus into the here and now and reality not imagination.
Try some yoga and meditation.
Not engage with intrusions - that gives them power.
Get distracted into things we like.
Change what we can accept what we cannot
Fight for our happiness
Switch from negative to positive bias.
Become a great dismisser.
Stop worrying. Worrying has no resolution. Using problem solving techniques does.

Smell the flowers taste the coffee

"Ok so in the last week I've been to the doctors and he increased my clomipramine to 150mg. I'm not sure that how I feel is related to that increase because one week is pretty quick to start feeling the effects of an increase.
The resulting feeling is one of being grounded, no more derealisation, and almost anxiety free. I've still got the thoughts but I feel I can almost separate myself from them and look at them from a distance.
The strangest thing is that I don't know what to do with myself or what to think anymore? Taking away my anxiety has almost removed my motivation. It's obviously been my burden but also my motivation to do things.
So I feel in some kind of limbo. I no longer feel anxious, yet I no longer know how I should feel!!

I have worries of harming others and some of the thoughts are horrendous, and I sometimes get an unwanted image of stabbing someone that stays with me for a while. When I see a sharp knife a harming others thought comes into my mind.
At home I am having to do a few rituals where I hold up a sharp knife for a while to show that I wont lose control with it. I sometimes have to go from the kitchen to outside the lounge (the hallway) where my family are sitting to show that I would not go into the lounge and ever lose control with it. However I still worry that the OCD will make me go into the room in front of them with a knife to get rid of the thoughts. I would never, ever carry out these thoughts and worry that the OCD will make me do the ritual in front of family next and they will get scared and think I am going to use the knife when they see me with it.

"Ive been invited to go along to a safari/theme park tomorrow. Its been organised by home-start, an organisation mainly helping young parents, whom im a volunteer for. Everyone is quite friendly but im not really friends with any of them but a lot of them are close and im worried ill feel all left out if i go
Im not good with big groups of people, i get all nervous and withdrawn and im sure it puts people off me further.
Ive already told the kids that we would go, as i knew i wouldnt be able to change my mind after this, but i am getting quite worried about this trip.
I thought maybe i could chaet a little and drive down in my car, rather than join 40 people on a coach, especially knowing i will be able to leave whenever i like
Oh why do these situations have to be so difficult??
Just the thought of what i need to take with us etc stresses me out, i might write a list in a minute to get it off my mind.
Wish me luck!

"So I have had my two days of induction for work and come this thursday I will have my first day. I am so worried about the day. I keep going through thoughts that I wont be able to do things they ask me to do etc. I am even waking during the night and worrying about it.
Worst thing is my mood and motivation hasnt improved that much and I am worried that this is going to effect me when trying to start work. I will be working 9 hours each day for 3 days and worry that the hours are going to be too long for me. Those three days are going to have so much change for me e.g times I eat etc.
What also worries me is that for the days that I have free I am still going to be doing nothing as I dont feel upto it. This is what has happened yesterday and today.

"Well it seems I am in the eye of the storm again and things seem calmer than they should be. It began last night with my thoughts just slowing down and not carrying the same weight or fear and an overall feeling of being a bit more calm and happy.
I am very suspicious of being happy at the moment (as well as almost every other thought and emotion) and find myself making sure that I am not having a thought at the same time as being happy. Daft I know.
Just a habit of constantly being on guard against them I suppose but just another habit I need to break or let go of.
This morning I caught a few thoughts before they had formed as I knew in the situation that my mind was going to throw one up. As a result I didn't have a spike.
I actually felt a sense of victory that I had beaten the thoughts to the punch and I guess that shows a good deal of habituation as I didn't particularly fear them coming either. I was wary but not truly fearful.
Of course then came the questions of did I like it, why am I calm is that a slight nervous feeling or happiness etc etc. I just stopped the rumination and moved on.
I still have the sense of nagging in the back of my mind again that says keep checking to see if you are scared but I am going to get on with my work and try to ignore it. The odd thought pops up but I am trying to just refocus and not react.
It feels like a very decisive moment where if I can just let go then I can make some real progress. I am thoroughly fed up of these thoughts now and dare I say it I am bored of being this way and fearing my own mind.
I also feel a bit of the derealization has lifted but of course that change makes me suspicious too.","['happiness', 'checking', 'fear', 'Thought']",1,1,1,0,0,0.0,"['fearful', 'rumination', 'spike', 'thought']","['happiness', 'fear', 'spike', 'rumination', 'checking', 'thought', 'fearful']",,1
"Hi I would really appreciate some advice please guys. As you will know from some of previous posts, Christmas is a very precious time for me (I am 25 now). Because it is somethign I hold dear my Pure O ocd rears its head at these times, and I worry more about my thoughts and generally feel anxious a lot of the time particularly whilst alone. I dont suffer with my ocd hardly at all these days after some fantastic CBT therapy - but I do at this time of year.
I tried to book an appointment with my GP but I cant get in until mid december. I have writted him a letter before for a re-prescription of Fluoxetine (2 x 20mg a day) and he has done it. I have not had it for many months now but I am sure he would approve. If I am to do it I would rather get it soon as it take a while to work rather than wait for the appointment. I just wondered if anyone had any thoughts about it.I would plan to take it for the next month or so as a short term fix to try and help me relax and enjoy my Christmas.
If you could take two minutes to write me a reply, I would really appreciate your time.

I have been struggling with OCD since I was very young. My first instance revolved around drawing cartoons as a child.

"Hi,
Well some of you know about my long history with OCD and, for the past 7 years POCD in particular. It may be slightly non-OCD related but I was really hoping to get some non judgmental opinions.
Basically, recently I have realised that I am a cocaine addict. When I was 19/20 I went through a bad stage with lots of drugs, then nothing for about a year (I just stopped, with no effort, got a job etc), then since about a year ago I started using again. Cocaine is the main issue. Last year it was every day for a few months at a time. Now, it's whenever I can afford it, which is about twice a week. Not as bad as before, but still.
I have never felt like an 'addict' I never relied on it, I just enjoyed it a lot, and when I had other stuff to focus on I just stopped automatically without effort. When I get really severely unwell with my OCD, I lose all interest in drugs of any kind. It's just a non-issue at those times because my mind is so wrapped up with OCD that the last thing I'm thinking about is getting high. A few months ago, a friend who I tell most things to implied that I might have a problem. I then became a little obsessive over it for a while (not anymore), and it's only since others have said it, and now the guilt I feel after using (I never had that before), that I feel like I need it, rather than want. I hate using the term addict as it implies victim and almost puts you in the position of 'oh it's a disease, I can't help it' (I have a couple of friends who act like that).
The thing is, from past experience, bringing up drugs with any psychiatrist results in them focusing completely on that and away from my OCD, which is the main issue. Cocaine doesn't affect my OCD, and my worst episodes with OCD have occured before I ever touched a drug, so I don't want them to blame everything on drug usage.
Psychologically, since I considered the thought of me being addicted, it feels like some of the power has been taken from me. I now feel like I need it, panicky if I can't get it, depression when I'm not on it etc. Coming off it will be a piece of cake compared to dealing with OCD, but it will still be difficult now I think.
I want to get back to enjoying life without it, and feeling great and creative and productive while not on it. It is so expensive and pretty soon my financial situation is going to change and I will be living off very little, so there's no way I will be able to afford it regularly. I am on the waiting list for CBT at a specialist anxiety disorders hospital, which I've been waiting for for ages. I can't mess that up by having them make me start a drug program. Also, while a couple of people know about this, and my Mum knows about most of my past, I cannot risk her or other family members finding out as they are under huge stress at the minute and this would really upset and disappoint them.
Does anyone have any advice?","['interest', 'guilt', 'disease', 'Thought', 'depression', 'Anxiety disorder', 'anxiety', 'anxiety', 'joy', 'OCD']",0,0,0,0,0,0.0,"['thought', 'obsessive']","['ocd', 'disease', 'joy', 'obsessive', 'interest', 'depression', 'thought', 'anxiety disorder', 'anxiety', 'guilt']",,

"Hey guys,
Oh my god. Well I never knew that there would be a name for my problem, let alone tons of websites dedicated to it! I've been picking my scalp and shoulders since I was a teenager. I'm now 26 and find that I do it most when I'm stressed out, or worried. I generally have a fidgetty nature in that I CANNOT sit still - I'm always either picking my head, chewing my cheek, chewing my fingers, or fiddling with something. In addition I tend to have social phobias at times and a small (but at times significant) blushing problem. I also obsess over having diseases (cancer - ugh, its hard to even type the word - , HIV, STD's, etc etc). So I thought that I was just a generally anxious person. I guess OCD and anxiety tend to go hand in hand though. As with many OCD and anxiety-ridden people, I drink a lot to relax and feel at ease... this always just leads to more anxiety and depression the next day... anyone else agree??!!
Anyway, I have found a cure for myself to stop picking, scratching etc. I get false nails put on once every couple of months.. The thickness of the """"""""nails"""""""" does not allow me to get any 'leverage' under my scabs and I end up just not picking my head anymore! My head clears up in a few days and stays clear for as long as my nails stay on!
I just wanted to share that with people - hopefully someone else will try it and it will help.
Good luck, everyone!

"Im 25
Had OCD since I was around 14.
Im a Gay man. But my OCD was obsessed with the Subject of being a Peadophile
I would go over and over, in my head seeing why these thoughts occurred, checking over all m past with a dark cloud above it
making false memories
I Started to obsess murder , rape, everything that was bad. I would believe id hurt someday every day and create a false memory.
2 years ago I had a breakdown, put on very high ant depressants, have psychotherapy and did good for 2 years, Still having
sensation by proxy, but ignoring it. And knowing myself.
Now I'm not sure why Im back to a dangerous place, stuck and not knowing my own mind, Ive come from London to my mums house, but i don't feel any better, waiting to see therapist on Friday. I've convinced myself I'm a pedophile, i feel sick, unable to sleep, and my body feels exhausted. Like this is the end.
The thought I can't get over is because I used to constantly checking my groin area to see of any moments, obsessively , this is very in detail but i know other people suffer from doing the same thing, not checking physically but thinking if theres growth or anything.
I used to do the same thing in dreams, where if a child was near, I would be nervous.

so, I really don't know how to explain this, this can be got or bad at the same time.

Not having had OCD for one day made things even worse!!
how's it possible that not having thoughts actualy make things worse?? Last night I was finally after a long time sure of where my heart was!
I saw clearly how I would love to have a family, a boyfriend who loves me. But it's like when I don't have the thoughts so often as usual, I almost forget how ocd works, so when another thought come I am back at square one. (
It's a bid long, but please read, I need some advice!
It's always one step forward and two steps back!! every little improvent suddenly morphs into a big worsening. I'm so tired
A LITTLE INTRODUCTION
I've noticed that in the last 2 days my thoughts have been less bothering. I still had moments when I was very anxious but they seemed to be less strong and I could manage anxiety.
Wednesday I had an exam at university, while I was on the bus on my way to university my head was full of thoughts, but they disminished when I met my classmates and we started to talk about the exam.
Then a few hours later while I was still waiting for my turn, another student I had never seen before came in, she was a girl, she had a very pretty face, and when I saw her I was overwhelmed by anxiety. It was awful, I started thinking """"""""this is it, i'm in love with her, this must be love at first sight"""""""".
This girl (other than having a very pretty """"""""elegant"""""""" face and blond long hair) was not so good looking as I first thought.
Or at least she was not what I usually think a """"""""pretty"""""""" girl looks like, besides, she was a bit masculin , she was wearing a leather jacket, she was a bit overweight and she was definitely not graceful. At this point my sick mind started thinking that she looked like the (sadly) stereotype of a homosexual girl. So I started to think """"""""you don't think she's pretty, but you like her, you must like her because she looks like a lesbian"""""""" and at this point i was screwed. My heart started racing and I couldn't concetrate anymore. It was hell. Then I started to stare at her and see if I really liked her or not, and the more I didn't like her the worse I felt, because I would understand seeing a perfect curvy girl with beautiful legs and hair and thinking """"""""wow , she's pretty"""""""" that would be normal, but seeing a girl you don't even find good looking, and thinking you like her, means that you see something more in her!! and I was scared as hell. But then my classmate started talking to me and then the anxiety slowly went lower.
Yesterday things started going a bit better, though in the morning my anxiety was still bad, during the day it almost vanished. To the point that I had moments when I could think """"""""what are you even worrying about?"""""""" and it felt GREAT!! By last night my doubts , on a scale of 1 to 10 were around 4, so It was pretty good.
This morning I woke up and as usually at mornings I had a lot of anxiety, I was terrified that my thoughts would come back as strong as before, but I started to force myself to remember how I felt yesterday, how I used to genuinely thinkg how much i would love to have a boyfriend on my own and things like that.
Then I rememberd the dream I had last night and it was a very weird dream.
In this dream I was running away from my husband , and a friend of mine (girl) was with me, in one """"""""scene"""""""" of my dream"""""""" my friend was in bed, and I don't know if I was about to join her or what , butt then someone knocked at the door (my husband) and I started to flee. I just remember this woman on this bad with only a nightgown ,so the situation was ambiguos and it felt weird to think of it this morning.
After that, my husband found me and at first we were arguing in the hotel lobby but then I started to give him and receive oral sex and other sexual intercourses in a public place. I woke up so confused and anxious I felt ashamed like hell I don't even know why I have these kind of dreams actually!! But this dream worsened my anxiety.
Anyway, this morning I tried to not let the thoughts take over me again and I was realizing that I had anxiety but almost no doubts, I had a feeling that something """"""""wasn't right"""""""" but I wasn't really worried that I might like women or anything.
At that point my ocd started kicking in saying """"""""wow, that's a shame you don't like women..."""""""" and I was a bit freaked out but didn't let it ruin my day. Today I also went to see my therapist and we spoke a lot about my trust issues and my inhability of being around others , I worry a lot about what other people may think about me, I don't let my self out because I was psychologically bullied in high shcool, and I can't trust anyone now.
During the whole day, today, I felt positive that I didn't have any attraction towards girls. I had some thoughts now and again but ithey were very vague I didn't even pay much attention to them.
I could even listen to a gay guy's song on the radio without feeling anxious , and I felt ok.
This evening though, I saw a woman on tv singing, and she was pretty enough, but she had very shor hair, (which I really don't like in women) so I started having the same thoughts I had about that girl at university. A few minutes later my mom and I were looking at pics of her on the internet and we found a kind of provocative picture of her with a white tshirt and her nipples were quite visible, I felt weird about it, and suddnely anxious. didn't know what that meant.
Then I decided to try to do a litle ERP excercise and I typed """"""""breasts"""""""" on google and looked for 2 minutes at pictures of women's breasts and try to control my anxiety, and it worked quite well because I didn't have lots of thoughts and I didn't even feel attracted or anything I just noticed some of them looked """"""""good"""""""" others did not.
I realized that I feel very unconfortable looking at any kind of breasts, though. And it bugs me.
Now , my point to all this is that after a day without thoughts, I started wondering """"""""maybe it wasn't ocd, it went away too easily"""""""" (I've had these thoughts on and off for 2 years, but they got worse last september) and so when tonight they came back, I started thinking """"""""see? even without ocd you still think those things...taht must be because you like women"""""""" and I know it's not true, but I can't put my mind at rest right now. Besides, I don't have a strong interest in guys to contrast the fear of liking women, I am sure I don't like women but the """"""""what ifs """""""" and all the """"""""you dont like men either"""""""" kill me! It0s not true! I hate this!!
earlier tonight I was looking at picture of an acotr I used to love, (Ryan from The OC) and I thought """"""""wow he's really cute!!"""""""" then I rememberd another actress who worked with him in that show and I always thought she was pretty, (Rachel Bilson) so I looked at her pictures and saw how pretty she was, and I started thinking """"""""so, you think he's cute, and you think she's rpetty, how do you know which one you really like?"""""""" this bugs sooo much!
because, I mean .. I don't have fantasies of marring that actor, I just think he's very hansome, but then I think that girl is very pretty, she's basically perfect, of course I don't fancy her either but then how do I know where my heart is???
Does anyone relate to this? I feel like I am not going anywhere, I'll always be stuck with one good day and 2 bad days for the rest of my life !!","['overweight', 'talking', 'singing', 'interest', 'fear', 'shame', 'OCD', 'anxiety', 'anxiety', 'Thought']",1,1,0,0,0,0.0,"['homosexual', 'thought']","['ocd', 'homosexual', 'anxiety', 'fear', 'talking', 'interest', 'shame', 'overweight', 'thought', 'singing']",,
"There are days, well everyday really, when I wake up that I think to myself...Okay I got this...I can handle this. My years of self-therapy, meditation, CBT, ACT, professional therapy have equipped me with the tools to handle this. I can handle today, I tell myself with the utmost enthusiasm every day when I get up out of bed. Today I will go to battle with my OCD, and I WILL NOT LOSE.
Then the thoughts come...before I have even leave my bed.
At first I can allow them space, and just let them be there...
But then they come in stronger, and stronger. """"""""What if that person is a Demon?"""""""" """"""""What if I start hallucinating?"""""""" """"""""What if I lose my mind?""""""""
I breathe...trying to remember the tools I have learned throughout countless hours of therapy. Breathe, allow the thoughts to be there, make room for them I tell myself. You are not your thoughts, they are just clouds passing by in the sky.
This seems to work...for a short while.
Then the thoughts mount another attack so fierce that it seems as if Satan himself sent them and I can't help but to engage with them... """"""""What if I secretly want to harm them?"""""""" """"""""I've never hurt anyone, everyone knows that"""""""" """"""""But what if you have to kill them"""""""" """"""""I'd never do that""""""""
""""""""What if they poisoned my food?"""""""" """"""""They did poison your food"""""""" """"""""Wait, why would they poison my food."""""""" """"""""I'm going to eat this food anyway because they wouldn't poison it"""""""".
I become aware I'm engaging in them...I breathe. I tell myself it's just anxiety, It's okay... Lean into the thoughts, accept their presence. You are not your thoughts I tell myself...It's okay.
This is a typical day for me...then I have massive guilt that I didn't properly use mindfulness. I look at my relationship with OCD as an alcoholics relationship with alcohol. I think my body/brain is addicted to the adrenaline, the """"""""rush"""""""" so it creates more intense thoughts/vision/feelings/sensations to get that """"""""high"""""""" or it's fix. The ironic part is that the high/fix is so ******* ****, but it's my brains way of working to help protect me from those metaphorical lions.
I don't know why I wrote this, sometimes I think writing stuff out can be highly beneficial...I yearn to break the cycle, to be happy, to FEEL. Tomorrow is another day, and I feel try again.
I love you all and thank you for taking some time to read this.

"I just thought however insigificant or significant my life is in this whole world of different places, countries, timezones, lives I would share with you what its like to be. I got up this morning last minute, half eight, when I have to be in work for 8.15. I get up and throw myself roughly together cos the way I feel right now I cant be bothered to spend time doing anything properly. I would rather spend the extra half hour in bed then face the world and my anxiety today. I grab something convenient to eat and then drive to work, When I am there I am going about my business but feeling so bad inside all the while. When break comes and lunch I eat any old rubbish, I dont care about my figure or my health when I feel as bad as I do. If I get some little minute enjoyment from food at least that is some bit of enjoyment. The day passes relatively ok and I am good humoured and hard working throughout despite the immense anguish and depression in my brain. Its approx 18.27pm now I am home and on my laptop here, trying to convey what I feel. I am holding back tears in my eyes cos of how sad I feel that things in my life really arent that bad but I feel I dont deserve to enjoy me or my life as I am a bad person. I occasionally get thoughts about things I like which in turn cause my huge distress and pain. It happened the other night whilst showering, I had a thought that shocked me then it led to another that shocked me more, and threw me into a deep depression. Its all I can do now not to kill myself and free myself from this terrible misery. I have the capacity to feel good, to be good yet I feel I do not deserve it. How can I after all I have sick likings as I call it. My brain never leaves me alone, even today at work I had them. I dunno where to go from here. I am not supposed to ruminate but then nothing relieves this pain, nothing stops my guilt, my downright hatred for myself. I ask God why me, why do I have this horrible condition. How can I deserve a life...Thanks anyone for taking the few minutes out of your lives to read about mine, wherever you indeed are this sprawling strange World with no answers.....

"Hi everyone,
We often read about doing the opposite of what anxiety/depression tells us to do. e.g. when we want to just stay under the bed covers and be miserable, we are told to get out and be active. And to distract ourselves from worries..... To the greatest extent I find this very true, but, having tried to do this, I have found that it has quite often resulted in bottling everything up and leading to a major depressive/anxious stage.
Since this realisation, I have decided to (on occasion), purposefully give in and do exactly what my mind is telling me to do... go to bed and stick my head under pillow and just be gloomy for a bit. Placing a kind of time limit on it though. So, perhaps for an hour or two, allowing myself to be miserable and sleepy, then rising and getting on with it. I have found that it really helps me to express my inner feelings and it seems to give me a 're-charge'. I really think that sometimes, you need to do this / cry in the corner alone / over someones shoulder or whatever. Anything else bottles it up like a time bomb waiting to explode.
Dont know if anyone else feels the same... Hope everyone is doing ok today.","['site', 'anxiety', 'anxiety', 'depression', 'hope']",0,0,0,0,0,0.0,[],"['anxiety', 'hope', 'depression', 'site']",,

"Hello, Miffy, and welcome. You've come to a very good place, there are many people here who understand what you're going thru and will sympathize with you. And better yet, offer you some very good advice, as you have already seen!
I am so pleased to hear that you will be going back to your doctor (or someone he/she recommends) to deal the BDD. High marks to you for having the courage to bring this up, I know how hard it is, that took tons of courage on your part and you should be extremely proud of yourself!!! :clapping:
And I can completely sympathize. I've been diagnosed with BDD in the past (amongst other things--grrrr!) and there are times I simply will not leave the house. My reasons are very like yours--as a child I was mercilessly teased (odd word for """"""""torment""""""""!!) because I wasn't skinny enough, or good enough at sports (even tho I'm female!), or whatever else I was """"""""supposed"""""""" to be. Bullying by classmates can be truly terrible.
Anyway, I'm so glad you're getting help for yourself, because believe it or not, you can get better--LOTS better, in fact!
Not to be nosy (lol!) but you don't mention whether you have any kind of support group (aside from our excellent selves, naturally! :laugh: ). It needn't be an actual support group--something like friends and family (the ones who understand), a church group, people with whom you share interests or a hobby. It helps me so much having people that I can talk to when I'm upset--while my therapist is great, I can't see her 24/7! :no: (I could ask about moving in with her, but I suspect her husband would strongly object haha!)

"Hello,
I was reading up about in-patient treatment for OCD in the UK and America and there seem to be common themes at different hospitals.
When someone first arrives at hospital they create a treatment plan involving CBT and workshops (e.g. mindfulness workshop, thought-challenge/cognitive restructuring workshop). There is a strict timetable of activities for each day with designated ERP/therapy time and free time.
Anyway apart from my little blip today I've tried to stick to my own hospital-like schedule and wondered if it would help anyone else to do the same thing?
For me having a set time that I have carry out an ERP exercise is helpful and makes me feel more in control, so does designating time when I can practice mindfulness meditation or exercise.
I can post about it but obviously it might be different for different people! you'd use self-help books and videos instead of the workshops and self-directed ERP.

"Hi there
I have been away for a little while as I was recovering.
I feel bad, that I dont visit the forums too often, when I am feeling well, but I have discovered, that it often keeps me in the OCD cykle for longer, if I do. My heroes are those people, that have beaten OCD, and keeps helping people on here. Thats so unselfish.
However, here I am again after feeling really good for a couple of weeks - I was really good at applieing my therapy and the four steps.
My main issue is relationship based worries, mostly """"""""do I love my husband or not"""""""", but sometimes other worries in the same context.
As I said, I have been good and enjoying life for a while. As late as saturday, I was thinking, that I was so gratefull for my life and family!
But then sunday morning I was having this dream where the guy from one of our closest friends couple was falling in love with me. I am not sure, if I was in love with him or just attracted and flattered (beleive me I have spend a lot of time analysing and trying to remember this)
The history is, that the woman and I are very close friends, our children are very close friends, and we have spend so many happy times as couples, and our husbands like each other very much.
I feel so bad after having this dream. I feel I have betrayed both my husband and girlfriend.
The two of them are getting married in the fall, an event I have been looking so much forward to - it is always nice to be celebrating love between two people, you care about!
But now I am wondering wether my dream was telling me something. What if I really fancy him? How did I really feel, when I heard about the marriage - did I feel bad? Will I be able to enjoy the party? And most of all, how can I do this to my womderful husband - what if it means something?
I know that this sounds like an OCD rant, and it probably is!
Whats really bothering me is, why this dream occured?
I could understand it better, if I was in the middle of a bad OCD period. Or if we had spend the day before with them, which we havent, its been weeks actually!
I know that we can dream everything but why him and why now?
I know that what we fear is prone to occour in our dreams to, but I was not in a worrieing phase... And why him?
Is the dream telling me something?
I really hope some of you can offer me some advise. I am aware, that we sholdnt reassure each other, but I need some kind of comfort and understanding.
Does anyone know, how to understand dreams. I have never really beleived in dream interpretation as such - I am a no nonsense kind of gal, but when the OCD kicks in, the common sense díssapears...

"Yesterday Rachie posted in my telephone topic about OCD thriving on fear and we fear what we cannot control/be certain of and it was like a light went on in a very dark corner of my mind.

As a result I have also told my husband how I am thinking and feeling and that I think I may have OCD and we have talked a little bit about it. The reason I wasn't telling him was due to fear - fear of how he would react, would he reject me, laught at me, pooh pooh it? Fear of rejection is a very big hang up of mine.
He did none of those things. He did not claim to understand what I was saying but he accepted it and agreed I should talk to the doc. His only concern is that the doc will just hand me some pills and send me away because they do not have time any more to sit and talk to the patients. I don't mind trying some pills if he will refer me to the mental health team as well.

Even though I don't have gay ocd, I really can identify with the feelings and urges you have with regard to my ocd. As Legend says, the urges feel so real to us and become stronger that we actually start believing in them. It is frightening because it's out of character with us and we think we really are capable of things. In fact we are all capable of doing the things we fear we might do. The difference is we all have a choice to act out these things and we can choose not to.

"Hi everyone
How are we all doing? Excuse the post; I just wanted to 'check in' as it were.
I'm feeling better again but felt very distressed right before work this morning, as I was afraid of the thoughts coming back. I felt some awful things. I'm not proud of some of the emotions in my head recently; I think I became a bit of a twit. My team-leader could tell I was struggling the other day and asked what they could do to help. Which I really appreciated, but it's hard, because I fear having horrible thoughts about them, so it's a vicious circle. I feel there's been an OCD explosion and I didn't fight hard enough to stop it. After a tricky start, I took myself off to the loo, let myself have five minutes, gave myself a pep talk and then marched back out to face the day. I think I need to let myself get distracted; I feel I've been resisting the distraction for some reason.
I think I have definitely become kind of depressed; I feel rather isolated in myself and just stepped away from everyone because I feel so left out. I don't know how to get involved in conversation or crack jokes without feeling awkward at work and can't join in with banter. It's especially hard when I try to be friendly with people and they don't say much in return, only to turn and be friendly towards someone else a few minutes later; makes me feel I've done something wrong. I've actually kind of come to dread social gatherings because I fear those feelings of feeling awkward and sticking out like a sore thumb. I know these are silly things to worry on and you can't get on with everyone and I shouldn't let my day to day moods be affected by a few people who I might not have a lot in common with after all. I think Snowbear was right a while ago when they addressed the problem of neediness with me, as it were. I know I just need to be comfy in my own skin, but I guess I feel kind of lonely. I'm certainly not treated unkindly - I'm spoken to civilly and most people are quite nice - but I'm just a bit of an oddball and sometimes, it shows. But I fear an evil streak inside me. I don't want that.
I'm not expecting anyone to respond; just wanted to get that out. I think it's obvious I still have a way to go, but I'm not licked yet!

"I dont post here much nowadays, and should probably contribute to some more threads here instead of expecting replies for my own... I WILL try and contribute more though..
I recently had my dosage of sertraline reduced by 50%.. I dont know if this has anything to do with the way im feeling but thought id mention it anyway.
I tend to brag about the same thing in my threads, but thats only due to the fact that life isnt really doing me any favours at the moment..
anyway
Back in august of this year i started to look at things in a more possitive light. I wont deny the fact that this was mainly due to the fact that i thought i finaly found a decent girl with whom i could have a good relationship with. That didnt go as planned.. a big turn around which wasnt by any means what i was expecting. Now that situation was a """"""""new"""""""" catylyst for a new very low mood.. a mood and feeling i hate having and hate living with. Im probably the type of person (as many with OCD) who find it hard to look at the possitives in their life and often magnify the negatives. However as im sure many of you are aware its not easy to change this.
Ive also noticed that ive become alot more angry.. Whether its society, news, events.. etc. Theres pleanty of things that light my short fuse and of course im sure you can imagen how hard it is to deal with when your mind makes to obsess constantly over these particular things.
Another thing.. Ive got a Work Xmas party coming up.. Its where i work part time, whilst studying... The problem with this is, the girl ive mentioned before will most likely be there. Nothings 100% confirmed and its still over a month away. However being as OCD makes it VERY hard to deal with """"""""girl"""""""" troubles, im literaly scared of this completly screwing with my mind. This girl doesnt work at this workplace anymore and despite it not being easy ive kind of been able to get used to not seeing her....
I seriously dont know whether i should attend this or not. I constantly hope for """"""""good"""""""" turn arounds in life but everything seems to backfire. I absoloutely HATE feeling the way i am now.. I felt like this towards the end of last year though it wasnt as bad.. and was really hoping for things to change for the better.... be more happy about life etc.. Now nearly a year on, ive experienced some highs and lows but personaly the lows really outweigh the highs for me..
I sometimes just get into a state where i seriously dont know what to do anymore. Im young with many more experiences ahead of me, but being as i experienced a lot as a young adult i really though that during these last few years, things would be a little easier for once.
Any advice / contribution to this would be greatly appreciated. Im tired of having to constantly fight for things.. go about things the hard way..

"Hi!
There's a few kinks I have yet to work out when it comes to OCD. I would sure appreciate a reply to either question.
The first being overcoming the feeling of feeling like a bad person. When you have OCD thinking something is almost just as awful as if you truly acted on it, or it makes you feel like you've done something wrong. For instance, I was looking at some dog toys for my dog and I got this feeling come over me basically making me feel like """"""""why would you be looking for dog toys, you've thought some terrible things and are not worthy of your animals love anymore"""""""" I can not engage with thoughts, it is becoming easier, but sometimes you just get these waves of emotion where it makes you feel like a bad person and I'm not quite sure how to address it?
The other being, I used to be alarmed with what I thought, I have since become rather desensitized to them, I had the """"""""backdoor spike"""""""" where it made me think it's more realistic now than ever, but I even managed to overcome that to be comfortable with the thought, but sometimes when the thought comes to mind you might think it's a """"""""hidden desire"""""""" and your mind might give you a slight feeling of """"""""wanting"""""""" it. Obviously this is not the case and just typing this makes me cringe, it's all made up thinking and """"""""feelings"""""""" but I wonder if I just keep ignoring it, even when it's false feelings, rather than just the false thought. I always am wondering if OCD can change you as a person, or change your rational side of your brain, which I do not know if it's even possible or not.

"Hello everyone, 
First off, I apologise for creating a new topic and not continuing with the last one, but I have a few questions that are not related to the subject from my previous topic.
I've shared on here a lot of things that I was afraid and really scared of, including whether I abused my baby cousin and brother or not, whether my behavior with them was inappropriate or not, and whether I am allowed to move on or not. 
Well, I successfully managed to no think about all these things for approximately 2 weeks if I am correct. They have not been bothering me that much anymore; however, this morning I made the mistake and let myself to ruminate over my past mistakes, including the above-mentioned things, and I went back to feeling distressed.
The distress is not too bad though, I think it's actually manageable so far - but I have a weird feeling that it will go downhill, and I will be back in the place I was 2-3 weeks ago by this evening. The distress is mainly caused by having the urge to replay all the moments that made me feel miserable, and to understand whether my behavior was appropriate or not. However, as hard as it is, I am trying not to listen to my brain, and tell myself that I've shared and talked about the respective moments with people on the forum, as well as with my boyfriend, and they listened, didn't judge me and advised me to move on. I am really trying not to give in and revisit the moments, even though it feels like I really need to do it. (I'm tempted to say that this is OCD trying to make me go deeper in its trap, but I'm not sure about that.)  
So my questions are the following:
What approach should I use?
Do I let the urge to analyse and revisit the respective moments be there even if my brain screams at me to do it? 
What do I do with the feeling that makes believe that I did something terrible (even when I've been told otherwise a thousand times) and elicits an enormous amount of guilt?

"I'm just wondering if anyone can help me with a couple of questions? I've only just realised that I suffer from OCD a few months ago and it's taking some time to accept this and adjust. The sypmtoms at times seems really confusing and I just don't know where I am. How effective is CBT in dealing with OCD? I'm a bit skeptical as to my chances of making any long term improvement. The other thing I'm wondering is how many people actually live a happy and fulfilling life whilst suffering from OCD? I seem to go through phases where I'm happy and the anxiety reduces, but all the things I obsess about are still there and somehow taint my view on life. Is it possible in the long run to get rid of the horrible anxiety? I'd really love to hear people's thoughts.

"Hey. I've been feeling a bit better this week, although feeling this way has been a hell of a struggle. I've forced myself to do a lot of stuff I wouldn't feel comfortable doing. I was even substituting at a school which raised some mild anxiety, because my OCD is related to intrusive sexual thoughts about children. Anyway, a few questions came into mind yesterday:
1. Does anxiety have an effect on memories? My OCD is related to a certain event and I usually sort of believe the OCD because I'm anxious most of the time. When I'm super anxious, the memory turns into something horrific and the then when there's no anxiety it's just a mildly unpleasant memory/thought.
I think I also keep attaching thoughts and putting things from this moment to the memories. I mean that I question my motives. I ruminate over the memory and then realize something: """"""""But I thought this at that moment! That must mean this and this and this. It changes everything"""""""". After that I get an urge to confess.
I have a hard time figuring out, what part is real and what's not. I can only say, that I didn't express much anxiety about the event before I got into the whole ruminating-game. The second thought I then get is that maybe I've changed. Maybe I was just immoral, disgusting and terrible before, but now I'm a normal person and express guilt because of that.
2. How long does a """"""""succesful"""""""" reboot take? I had a couple of times when I felt great for a couple of weeks and then there's been a terrible relapse. My brain comes up with something else and I'm back to thinking the same old things.","['urge', 'moral disgust', 'disgust', 'guilt', 'OCD', 'anxiety', 'anxiety', 'Thought']",1,1,0,0,0,1.0,"['thought', 'intrusive sexual thoughts']","['ocd', 'moral disgust', 'disgust', 'thought', 'urge', 'intrusive sexual thoughts', 'anxiety', 'guilt']",,
"Ok, in the past, I have been doing something completely normal, and an anxious, uncomfortable feeling comes over me. I've carried on doing what I was doing and moved on from it. Then, in the future, I've thought about the time the anxious, uncomfortable feeling came over me and thought 'Did I do something inappropriate then?' Is there a specific term for this? and is it addressed anywhere on this site?
Also, I know some peoples OCD focus' on fearing they might do something. Do any of you have it where you think 'Did I do something wrong / inappropriate in the past?'

"Okay, aside from OCD, I have thought it was likely for a while that I have a mild to moderate form of gross motor dyspraxia. Both my younger sisters have dyslexia, one of them quite badly and as far as I am aware the two are linked. It has been suggested before that this may explain my acute lack of direction/spatial awareness which leads to a lot of breakages and getting lost. Usually I am able to see the funny but at times, like today, when I am trying to find places and I am incapable of following simple instructions I get quite distressed. I also have a lot of trouble reversin directions...ie, on the way back and switching between right and left.
I have booked an appointment with the doctor as, after careful consideration, I have decided I want to be referred for a formal diagnosis of OCD. I want appropriate help and provision and I want to have the best possible state of mind I can with this thing....the same goes for dyspraxia if that's what it is.
However, I am also aware that 'on antidepressants, OCD, dyspraxia, possible GAD' doesn't make the best CV for someone working with children (or the best singles ad for that matter ). I am not ashamed of my problems and if I am working in the right place I am more than happy to disclose this. However, if at any point in the future I wish to keep this back will this still be possible with a formal diagnosis or am I obliged to tell my employer?

Sorry I am posting again but I am genuinely worried about something. I dont know if this is my OCD or just a normal worry.
I have not seen my mum for a whole year. Just over. The day I saw her was when my OCD started. That was the last time.
Its coming to Christmas and I am going to England to visit family. I said to my mum that I would go and see her but I am really worried that it will set of my OCD again. Seeing her like that. Shes in a bad way, not taking care of herself and I just feel nervous and get the dark feelings I had last year.
A part of me is saying, right go and see her. This is exposure to a fear etc but then I really am worried it will kick things off again.
Can anyone advise me on this. I know its quite a personal thing but put yourself in my shoes and advise me from there if you can.

I have no desire to reassurance seek, because I know I simply have a problem. I think before I was wanting to do it out of doubt, but now that it's gone, I feel... okay, without it.
Though, I do kinda want to talk to somebody irl about it, but its more wanting them to know what I'm going through/get them to understand OCD. I'm holding off, though, until things aren't as stressful over here.
Idk, I just don't see what I was so worried about. Like, earlier this morning, I had a breakthrough. I was getting sick over the idea of harming someone, and it just... dawned on me, that if I was that bothered by the idea, of course the thoughts weren't me!
I feel... okay. PB says that we need to stop concerning our actions on others' judgements, and I finally understand where he's coming from.
I don't need to concern myself, because it's all just OCD, and not me.
It's a good feeling.
I can also comprehend how OCD works. Twisting and creating doubt, false emergencies. So that's good!

He liked the saying :
When the going gets tough, the tough get going. 
But he also had one of his own. He said, when things get difficult, trade through them. 
This means don't panic, don't get upset - work on the problems giving them your best endeavours, and they will get resolved.

I believe one of OCD-UK's main intents when setting up the forums was that sufferers should help each other from their individual experiences, in a controlled environment under the auspices of the moderators. 
 I have been stuck at home this last week, needing to be in to supervise, and having workers all over the place carrying out renovation works. 
So I spent a lot of time in the main support forum and could see at first hand the tremendous helpful work that is being done by sufferers for sufferers, and played my own part in it. 
I have also myself learned some valuable lessons. 
Remember folks to take a look at the main OCD-UK website which is packed with facts and help - and visit the bookstore for your self-help books and merchandise. 
It's easy and inexpensive to become a full member of OCD-UK. You can do so from the link on the forum.

I often hear that people have tried CBT but it does not work.

It is a set of tools, which arms you to leave therapy and a bit like learning to drive, you only learn to drive after you pass your test and start driving daily.

"Today I turn 25. In the very early minutes of this morning my husband took to holding me in a vice like grip, grinning mischievously and singing happy birthday into my ear (he sounds like a drunken camel when he sings, but you know, I still love it ) . He then took to winding me up about turning a 'quarter of a century', something I did to him on his 25th birthday. He mentioned we could visit retirement homes, have cake and milk so I can manage it with dentures, we could go to the pond and feed the ducks but I have to promise not to wander off now I'm 'getting on a bit', you get it...my husband is a wide-up merchant!
When he released me, he took to a (more loving) Facebook status, wishing his now wife a happy birthday and the such. When he returned his attention to me he was greeted by the sight of me sobbing gently into my pillow. Wiping away the tears, he asked me what was wrong.
""""""""I just want to be happy for once, there's no point wishing to be rid of anxiety as the more you fight it the harder it gets, but I wish I could just be happy"""""""".
Soon after that thought, I changed my wish again. I don't wish that I could be happy, I wish that we could all be happy. I'm not going to wish we could be rid of OCD, we all know that sometimes wishing for something we know is unlikely or even impossible can make us feel worse, but I just wished we could all be happy, even for a day, just some smiles and laughter all round.
So there's my birthday wish, folks. I don't want ponies or castles or fancy cars, just for everyone with OCD, anxiety and depression to feel happy again, soon :original:

"Hello,
I've got an appointment to see my cbt therapist in a couple of weeks, but this weekend was really tough. It was also my first birthday as a single dad and I found that emotional to say the least.
I had planned on cleaning my apartment, but I have this fear of contamination. At times I feel paralyzed to start cleaning for fear that I'm contaminating the rest of the apartment - moving dirt/chemical contaminants from one small part of my place and spreading it everywhere. I wonder at times if it's a lack of confidence that I can't do things right. It's so frustrating. I know people with ocd who are neat, even over the top neat, and I want to be, but feel scared and end up giving in - washing hands, changing cleaning supplies, showering to rid myself of this set of contaminants. If I was a maid I might as well wear Speedos and a swim cap for the amound of time I spend in the water. In a way, I feel safe in the shower.
The craziest bit is that it doesn't bother me outside my home. But once I get in the door, it's just so over the top.
Ugh. Thanks for letting me get this off my chest.

"Dear all,
Sorry to bother you again as i know you have enough of me but i felt at this moment in time i really need to release some anger and stress. I am currently in 6th form (started tuesday) and have had began starting coursework for some subjects and others i am just learning the curriculum. I have took 3 optional subjects (Chemistry, Biology and Business) along with the core ICT, PE and Personal Development. However, after starting my chemistry course i feel really angry and upset. Since i have never done A level chemistry i am finding it to be the hardest thing i have ever done in my entire life. In year 10 i studied single biology and in year 11 i studied nationals ( a 100% coursework course just brushing up on all 3 sciences). When i had the option evening i told the head of science that i have never done GCSE chemistry but want to be a doctor so badly! He told me to try it out and i have. However, its really really really really really hard! I haven't heard of half of the terms and when my teacher asked me about things and i didn't know he went mad. We have already started our coursework and i have no idea about anything about it! He has already lowered my marks for asking for help. I am planning to see him on monday to cover up the issues about it. I can;t even sleep as i worry about it. I know its either a choice of doing it or choosing something else but i want to be a doctor and need chemistry. My OCD has shot up again and my hands are getting sore. I've never wanted to be good at something so much as i do at chemistry. I need an A in it too and with my coursework marks already lowered without even starting it i'm in deep trouble - my dreams are dashed! Part of it is him maming sure i can do it properly and if not then he HAS to lower my marks. I'm really scared and upset that i won't get the A and my friends will in their cxhosen fields such as psychology. I am crying even now it makes me so mad and angry! I have no idea what to do and just want to end it all. I feel unworthy of anything, i'm no use and my GCSE grades me nothing to me or anyone anymore.

My girlfriend lives 30 mins away from me, she picks me up and takes me to hers, my ocd is telling me to stop talking to this girl, or else something bad will happen, like a car crash, im not a believer in karma, but my ocd is making it believable.

"Just been thinking about my life and how i was before i realised i had OCD, in quite a reflective mood today for some reason.
I am not sure if this is down to having OCD or if it is just a natural shift in gears in my life, but i have found that i have really cut myself off from the outside world.
A few years ago i used to enjoy going out with friends, even if it was just once a week (another sign as i used to go out all the time) but now i feel i cant trust anyone and the friends i do make just back stab me or seem fake and are not the kind of friend i want anymore.
I moved to Cumbria last Sept and have made a few """"""""friends"""""""" since being here, but 99% of them i cannot trust and all seem to want something of personal gain from a friendship. Very odd and something i am not at all used to.
I work most days and get out meeting people, but i just cannot wait to finish the shift and get home under my roof where i know i am safe an no one can touch me or get into my mind/life. Does that sound odd?
As i have basically no friends here i have found myself becoming very trusting in people just to try and make friends, and this has done me no good as i have been burnt and used, even bought someone a gift to make them happy as they were low, only to figure out she backstabbed me just after. I feel terribly alone to be honest.
I think my trust issues also go back to over hearing that my ex on the phone years ago that he was going to cheat on me, this still really upsets me. That i can be used in this way. Should i still be upset over this?
im quite teary writing this, but just wanted to get it off my chest and to see if anyone else feels very alone and isolated since having OCD?
i am returning to London next month and i plan to spend as much time as i can with my best friend as he is my rock (and has OCD) why cant i find friends like him where i live?","['outside', 'joy', 'writing', 'OCD']",0,0,0,0,0,0.0,[],"['writing', 'ocd', 'joy', 'outside']",,

So this is a Buddhist podcast (the chanting at the beginning doesn’t last long!).
It’s not directly about OCD; it is about the cognitive processes of the mind, and the never-ending stories about ourselves and the world our brains churn out. However, the nature of the topic means that it can be easily applied to helping understand OCD (in my opinion). In fact it does a very good job of explaining the some of the processes of OCD, coming at it from a mindfulness point of view, if you listen with that in mind.
This isn’t about persuading anyone to be Buddhist. I have NO interest in that. It just picks apart how the mind works, and how it proliferates. And how false our assumption is that our thoughts are the truth. I think this could be helpful to other sufferers.
Of course others may disagree with this, in fact I’d appreciate your feedback if you do give it a listen.","['interest', 'Thought', 'OCD', 'cognitive process', 'process']",0,0,0,0,0,0.0,['thought'],"['ocd', 'cognitive process', 'interest', 'thought', 'process']",,

"aww guys i am sorry , i feel that i am always mithering everyone for ideas .....but it is only cause you guys are ace at coming up with things - so apologies in advance
on wednesday i am filming for a programme and podcast ???? i have no idea what one of those are ???
well anyway i am filming for sommat and its an hour long feature programme on depression and anxiety.
i feel like i am exactly not the right person to be doing this with it being on depression because my depression is worse than my ocd
but hey ho i'm doing it anyway , so i was working out what to say for it . and so i guess guys i was just looking for ideas of tips or anything that has helped you with your depression or anxiety
i have a few ideas below, but if anyone can think of anymore that has helped them that would be fab. i wont mention any names in the recording unless you want me to . thanks guys xxxxxxxxxxx
so ideas i have come up with to help depression and anxiety
1. physical exercise - especially stuff done with others like in a group , because it releases endorphines in the body etc etc
also it gets you out to meet people, which in itself can combat depression and lonliness and increase self confidence.
2.joining forums and attending self help groups - people dont realise how many others suffer with depression and anxiety, so this helps us to help each other and makes us less introspective and we begin to realise we are not so alone after all.
3.getting involved in a project to give us something to aim for - preferably a charitable one for the benefit of others - this gives purpose and meaning to our exsistence and again helps us meet others - so stuff like volunteering to meet the elderly or sommat along those lines- aiming for a goal.
4. repeating positive affirmation statements - doesnt sound like it will work , but repeated regulaly we have positive ammunition to counter all those negative things we tell ourselves.
5. reading books - not only to increase our understanding of depression etc, and to read about others who have problems too,but other books too - to take us out of our own minds and sadness for a while
6.to try and stay in this moment right here right now - to not worry about the past or stress about things which may or may not happen in the future - to stay in the moment.
7. relaxation tai chi meditation - some say it helps - plus it can get you out meeting others too.
8.starting a college course - helps you to gain confidence and meet others too
9. to realise that we have a choice over how we feel - sometimes we think we have no choice - but practised a lot we can begin to realise that we can have a choice and decide our moods - cbt and counselling can help us discover this - as can meditation
10. to be kind to ourselves and realise that its tiny baby steps and we wont change all of a sudden over night - just little tiny steps everyday , and if we slip back - who cares we just learn from it - get up and carry on.
11. to look after , treat and pamper ourselves - get plenty of sleep and eat well .
12.oh- i have forgotten what i was gonna put now and its gonna drive me mad......does anyone know what i was gonna say ???
oh i remembered - to keep a mood diary and a list of stuff that has worked for us - that way - when we are soooo depressed that we cant see anything - we can refer back to the diary and see that at one time a visit to uncle fester helped cheer us up...so we can repeat that :lol: we could also write a list of stuff we like to do or things we like about ourselves or our achievements so that when we are down on ourselves and calling ourselves useless, we can say - well actually i can do this - or i achieved that
13.to try and do things that scare us occassionally - very often we worry about things and when we come to do them , we wonder why we were so worried - its always worse before hand- when we actually come to do something its never as scarey as we anticipated. so to try and do something that scares us increases our self confidence / self belief and makes the list of things we can do get bigger !!!!!
14.to never be afraid to admit how we are feeling to to ask for help- we dont have to be macho or brave - its ok to ask for help if your a man....so many many people suffer in silence - its a sign of strength to ask for help - not weakness.
15. to realise that the first step is the hardest - after that it gets easier and that tough times wont last for ever - things wont always be this way
have i missed off anything useful folks ?
when i was interviewed over the phone by the producers they said that they didnt really want to ask me questions - they would rather let me talk naturally about it cause they liked the way i waffle on and on and on and on so they didnt want to break my flow so to speak , but i am worried now about remembering what i can say
is there anything else that can help - thankyou so much guys xxxxxxxxxxxxxx

"I have just posted this on another thread, but I thought it might be helpful to others if I was to explain a little about our charity, and why certain areas of the forums are restricted to OCD-UK members only, so I will try and explain a little more about our charity and the work that we are doing this year.
OCD-UK costs about £68,000 to run each year, but we get no funding to run the charity other than that donated by our members through membership, donations and sponsored events, so we're totally reliant on donations from our members, because of this added benefits are offered to those members including chat access, over 350 games (for refocusing), gallery, blogs, members magazines, discount on conferences, access to members only social events, advocacy support, telephone support group, merchandise discount and when we can offer more, we will.
Every Christmas we open the chat and arcade for all, but this year we did not revert chat back until now, but we will leave it open for a couple more days for all rather than just revert it straight back.
That said, we remain committed to offering a support service to the OCD community and in the last 2 months we have made the following freely available.
- Children's OCD guide
- Young Persons OCD guide
- Four Steps self-help synopsis
- 30 minute Four Steps self-help video
- 90 minutes of conference audio recordings
- Live webchat with Paul Salkovskis
In addition to announcing two events
- Conference for FFC
- Audience with OCD expert Dr Adam Radomsky
and on a daily basis providing free support through
- Email
- Telephone
- Letter
- and of course this forum 24/7, fully moderated.
I am also pleased to announce forthcoming projects including:
- 5 Month research into the implementation research of the NICE guidelines for OCD
- Taking 40-50 kids with OCD (and a parent each) for a family fun day at Alton Towers
- Additional Support for new mothers and mothers to be with OCD
- Looking at the impact on OCD in older people
- More webchats with experts
- OCD guide for parents of children and young people with OCD
and to further show our commitment to the younger generation and to coincide with the release of our young peoples OCD guide we will be offering reduced discount for OCD-UK membership to young people under the age of 22 (those under 22 that are already members will be offered extended membership).
I can assure you that we will continue to work hard behind the scenes to bring in funding to offer far more freely available to the entire OCD community in the future.
I hope that explains where our members £2 a month goes, and the work that we are doing for the benefit of all the OCD community.","['Thought', 'email', 'hope', 'OCD']",0,0,1,0,0,1.0,"['thought', 'hand']","['ocd', 'email', 'thought', 'hope', 'hand']",,
